Multiple species of Plasmodium parasites can cause human malaria. Most studies and elimination efforts target P. falciparum, the most common cause of malaria worldwide and the species responsible for the vast majority of the mortality. Other Plasmodium species, such as P. ovale, typically lead to less severe forms of the disease but little is known about the molecular mechanisms at play during malaria infections with different parasites. We analyzed host and parasite gene expression from children successively infected with P. ovale and P. falciparum and found that, while the parasite gene expression differed significantly, the transcriptional profiles of the host immune cells were similar in P. ovale or P. falciparum infections. This suggests that infected individuals respond to uncomplicated malaria infections similarly, regardless of the Plasmodium species causing the infection, and that alternative immune processes may become important during the progression to severe P. falciparum malaria rather than being inherent features of P. falciparum infections. Additionally, we observed similar levels of genetic diversity among P. ovale and P. falciparum parasites, suggesting that the P. ovale population might be larger than currently thought, possibly due to extensive misdiagnosis or the existence of hidden reservoirs of parasites.
