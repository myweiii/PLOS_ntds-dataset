    "Background": "Accurate mapping of schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil transmitted helminths (STH) is a prerequisite for effective implementation of the control and elimination interventions. A precision mapping protocol was developed and implemented in the coastal region of Kenya by applying the current World Health Organization (WHO) mapping guide at a much lower administrative level (ward).",
    "Methods": "A two-stage cluster survey design was undertaken, with 5 villages in each ward selected. From within each village 50 households were randomly selected, and a single child between the ages of 8 and 14 sampled following appropriate assent. The prevalence and intensity of infection of Schistosoma mansoni and STH were determined using the Kato-Katz method (single stool, duplicate slides) and urine filtration for S. haematobium.",
    "Results": "Of the 27,850 school age children sampled, 6.9% were infected with at least one Schistosoma species, with S. haematobium being the most common 6.1% (95% CI: 3.1\u201311.9), and Tana River County having highest prevalence 19.6% (95% CI: 11.6\u201331.3). Prevalence of any STH infection was 5.8% (95% CI: 3.7\u20138.9), with Lamu County having the highest prevalence at 11.9% (95% CI: 10.0\u201314.1). The most prevalent STH species in the region was Trichuris trichiura at 3.1% (95% CI: 2.0\u20134.8). According to the WHO threshold for MDA implementation, 31 wards (in 15 sub-Counties) had a prevalence of \u226510% for SCH and thus qualify for annual MDA of all age groups from 2 years old. On the other hand, using the stricter Kenya BTS MDA threshold of \u22652%, 72 wards (in 17 sub-Counties) qualified for MDA and were targeted for treatment in 2021.",
    "Conclusions": "The precision mapping at the ward level demonstrated the variations of schistosomiasis prevalence and endemicity by ward even within the same sub-counties. The data collected will be utilized by the Kenyan Ministry of Health to improve targeting."
