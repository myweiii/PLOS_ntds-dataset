TLRs can recognize and bind to several PAMPs and trigger a series of signal transductions, ultimately leading to the release of inflammatory mediators, initiating the innate immune response, removing the invasive pathogenic microorganisms, and playing an important role in innate immune defense. According to many recent studies, TLR2 plays an important role in allergic diseases, such as asthma; however, its mechanism has not been fully revealed. Here, we demonstrated the interaction between the KA/E2 infection and TLR2 in vivo and in vitro. Although our findings provide invaluable insights into the mechanisms of the interaction between parasites and host, the mechanisms whereby KA/E2 infection induces allergic airway inflammation in the host should be clarified via further research. Overall, in this study, mice with TLR2 gene knockout were used as the study objects and KA/E2 trophozoites were induced as an allergen to establish the asthmatic mouse model. The role of TLR2 in the asthmatic mouse model and its possible mechanism of action were observed, thereby providing new insights into the pathogenesis of asthma and identifying new possible targets for asthma prevention and treatment.
