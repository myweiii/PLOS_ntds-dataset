Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) is a vector-borne viral disease first described in 1952 in Africa, which recently reached the Americas, where it then originated epidemics of unprecedented magnitude. Its acute phase is characterized by fever associated with joint pain and edema, which resolve in about seven days for most patients. However, 25–40% of these patients develop chronic musculoskeletal and arthritic symptoms, which may be incapacitating and lead to permanent joint damage. We have conducted a prospective longintudinal cohort of CHIKF confirmed individuals, in Brazil, which aimed to identify clinical early markers of evolution to post-Chikungunya chronic inflammatory joint disease (pCHIKV-CIJD) after 90 days, using objective physical examination to define pCHIKV-CIJD. We have also performed joint ultrasonography to improve evaluation of chronic arthritis. We found that 45.3% of patients who completed the follow-up met criteria for pCHIKV-CIJD. Women were at higher risk of chronification, as well as individuals who remain symptomatic 21 days after the onset of symptoms. Abnormal ultrasonography results were seen in 90.6% of examined pCHIKV-CIJD patients, in whom synovitis and joint effusion were the most commom songraphic signs, affecting mostly ankles and knees. The adoption of objective criteria to define pCHIKV-CIJD is crucial to estimate accurately the proportion of patients who evolve to chronic rheumatism, and to indentify early risk factors to this outcome, which may add important information to tailor therapeutic strategies for this particular population. It may also help to understand the burden of CHIKF in developing countries, measuring either its impact in individual’s quality of life, or its communitary repercussion after widespread outbreaks.
