Preventing Aedes aegypti populations from spreading arboviruses in highly populated areas primarily relies upon chemical control with insecticides, such as pyrethroids, applied by public health agencies to target the female mosquito vector. However, the development of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations jeopardizes these vector control strategies. The impact of the different kdr mutations conferring resistance to pyrethroids on the survival of Ae. aegypti in the field is not fully understood. We previously found that two knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) did not increase survivorship in field cage tests despite their widespread presence and high frequency. In this paper, we report the first detection of the V410L kdr mutation in combination with the V1016I and F1534C genotypes. Most females were detected with kdr mutations at one, two or three of these sites in the VGSC. Genotyping females after insecticide application in field cage tests showed that the V410L mutations were associated with higher survivorship only at the 15.24- and 22.86-meter distances from the source of the spray application, as we observed that the LL/II/CC genotype had higher survivorship than the VL/II/CC genotype at these distances.
