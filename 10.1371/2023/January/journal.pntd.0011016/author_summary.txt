The cytoadherence of T. vaginalis onto hVECs from urogenital tracts has not been fully elucidated, so we developed an integrated assay platform to multifacetedly monitor the distinct behaviors and host-parasite interactions of nonadherent and adherent T. vaginalis isolates. The binding assay revealed that the trophozoites from the adherent isolate discretely bound to hVECs in the initial infection, later aggregating into clusters on the hVEC monolayer, and this cluster formation was reduced by lactose. T. vaginalis infection triggered galectin-1 and -3 secretion from hVECs to bind to the parasite, then galectin-3 was engulfed in the lysosome inside the trophozoites of the adherent isolate. Imaging analysis revealed that cytoskeleton reorganization is important for flagellate-amoeboid transformation and consequential cytoadherence. Also, the parasite behaviors of exploring and anchoring to hVECs via its axostyle contribute to the initial stage of cytoadherence. The parasite may also sense environmental factors from the host cell to change migration. Moreover, differential acetylation indicates the presence of epigenetic variation between the adherent and nonadherent isolates. No mycoplasma was detected in the T1 or TH17 isolates indicating that the symbiont may be not a determining factor for TH17 intrinsic cytoadherence. These distinct features and differential host-parasite interactions may be correlated to the pathogenesis of this parasite.
