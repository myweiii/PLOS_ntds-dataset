    "Introduction": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania; it is transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies [1]. Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of the disease [1,2]; in 2019, Brazil reported 97% of all VL cases in the Americas [1]. Domestic dogs are natural reservoirs of Leishmania in urban areas [2,3] because they present a high parasite load in the skin and live near humans, facilitating transmission [4\u20136].\nDuring CanL, the spleen is among the most parasitized [7\u20139] and where the major immune response in leishmaniasis occur [10]. Spleens of infected animals display a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response [8]; symptomatic dogs show predominantly Th2 responses that contribute to parasite development [11,12]. In contrast, resistance to CanL has been associated with IL-12-induced Th1 protective immune responses and pro-inflammatory cytokine production [13,14] (IFN\u03b3, IL-12, IL-6, TNF [15]), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [16] and nitric oxide (NO) [17] leishmanicidal activity.\nLeishmania infection can suppress host immune responses [18]. High parasite load implies low cytokine expression in the canine spleen [15]. Low splenic iNOS [16] and IL-12 mRNA [15] levels have been associated with parasite persistence during CanL. Nevertheless, TNF-\u03b1 is increased in the spleen during CanL, and this cytokine was related to disease process evolution [9].\nMicroRNAs (miR) are small non-coding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation [19,20], affecting immune response in inflammatory diseases [20]. Recent studies demonstrated changes in miR expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [21] and splenic leukocytes (SL) [22] from dogs naturally infected with L. infantum.\nMicroarray analysis revealed a 2.29-fold increase of miR-148a in SL during CanL. In silico analysis revealed canonical pathways directly regulated by miR-148a. These included PTEN signaling, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis of target cells, the Th1 and Th2 activation pathways, and antigen presentation, among other pathways related to cytokine production regulated by this miR [22].\nMicroRNA-148a is a member of the miR-148/-152 family located on human chromosomes 7, 12, and 17, mouse chromosomes 6, 15, and 11 [23]. This miR can modulate innate and adaptive immunity genes, particularly antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) [23,24]. It is also involved in cancer initiation, tumor growth, and metastasis [23].\nAccording to the miRBase Sequence Database (a database of published miRNA sequences), cfa-miR-148a is encoded in the cromossome 14 and presents complete homology between mice and humans [25]. Studies showed that miR-148a reduced IL-6, IL-12, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 in experimentally induced inflammatory disease in a human microglial cell line [26] and murine models [24,27]; however, the role of miR148 in immune regulation of CanL has not yet been studied.\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that transfection with a miR-148a mimic resulted in downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12), and a miR-148a inhibitor reduced parasitic load in cultured SL obtained from dogs naturally infected with L. infantum.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThe Animal Experimental Research Ethics Committee approved the study, and we received the approval of the Animal Use Ethics Committee of UNESP\u2013Universidade Estadual Paulista \"J\u00falio de Mesquita Filho\u201d (process 00624\u20132018).\n\n\nAnimal screening and sample collection\nThe control group consisted of five healthy mongrel animals 2\u20135 years old (three females and two males) without hematological and biochemical alterations, that presented no detectable anti-Leishmania antibodies according to immunochromatographic (Dual-Path Platform DPP) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [28], and no detection of Leishmania DNA by molecular analyses (S1 Table) [29].\nThe CanL group consisted of fourteen mongrel dogs (2\u20135 years old) naturally infected with L. infantum. These dogs came from the Ara\u00e7atuba Zoonoses Control Center and presented detectable anti-Leishmania antibodies according to immunochromatographic (Dual-Path Platform DPP) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [28], and detection of Leishmania DNA by molecular analyses [29]. All dogs were symptomatic and had at least three clinical signs: onychogryphosis, weight loss, ear-tip injuries, lymphadenomegaly, cachexia, alopecia, or periocular and skin lesions (S1 Table).\nBlood samples were obtained from the jugular vein puncture from both groups and placed in tubes without anticoagulant to obtain serum for indirect ELISA [25] (S1 Table) and biochemical profile (S2 Table) and tubes containing EDTA (BD, USA) to perform complete blood counts (S3 and S4 Tables). All samples were processed immediately after collection.\nInfected dogs were euthanized using thiopental (Crist\u00e1lia Itapira, SP, Brazil), followed by intravenous 19.1% potassium chloride injection by the same route, as recommended for VL control and in situ compliance with local legislation. After euthanasia, 2 cm3 spleen fragments were collected for SL isolation. Spleen fragments in control dogs were removed by surgical excision [12]. All spleen fragments were maintained in complete RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA), 0.03% L-glutamine (Sigma, USA), 100 IU/mL of penicillin (Sigma, USA), and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin (Sigma, USA), for SL isolation until processing.\n\n\nSplenic leukocyte isolation\nSplenic leukocytes were obtained from 2-cm3 fragments that were macerated and added to 10 ml of RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.03% L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. After removing cell debris with a 100-\u03bcm cell strainer (BD Falcon Cell strainer, USA), suspensions were processed with 5 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer containing 8 g/L ammonium chloride 1.6 g/L EDTA, and 0.16 g/L calcium carbonate at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes. This material was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.2 three times. Cells were then counted in a Neubauer chamber.\n\n\nSerological diagnosis by ELISA\nSerum samples were analyzed by ELISA assay using total antigen from lysed promastigotes [28]. The antigen was coated overnight with 20 \u03bcg/ml protein (pH 9.6), then washed three times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (washing buffer) and saturated for 1 hour with 150 \u03bcl/well of a mixture of PBS and 10% FBS at room temperature. Next, the preparation was rewashed three times with washing buffer. Blocking buffer/Tween (100 \u03bcl of serum sample (1/400) diluted in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 10% FCS) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 3 h, followed by three washes with washing buffer. Subsequently, 100 \u03bcl/well of anti-dog IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at appropriate dilution in blocking buffer/Tween was added, incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and washed. Substrate solution (0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) and 0.4 \u03bcl/ml hydrogen peroxide in phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5.0) was added at 100 \u03bcl/well and developed for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 50 \u03bcl of 3M sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a Tecan microplate reader (Sunrise model ref. 16039400).\nNegative and positive controls were included in each plate. Positive controls obtained from a hyperimmune animal were included. The cutoff was determined using the mean +3 standard deviations of the readings obtained from post-transfection, performed using the commercial mirVana kit for isolation serum samples of healthy dogs from areas non-endemic for leishmaniasis.\n\n\nDNA extraction and determination of Leishmania species\nExtraction of total DNA from 5 x 104 SL with a commercial kit (Kit Dneasy [Qiagen]) was performed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Final DNA elution was 50 \u03bcL. Determination of the Leishmania species was performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) [29], comparing the restriction profiles of the sample with profiles obtained from L. infantum (IOC / L0575-MHOM / BR / 2002 / LPC-RPV), L. braziliensis (IOC / L0566-MHOM / BR / 1975 / M2903) and L. amazonensis (IOC / L0575-MHOM / BR / 1967/ PH8) as positive controls, and water as a negative control (S1 Fig).\n\n\nExtraction and quantification of total RNA\nExtraction of total RNA, including miRNAs, from 5 x 104 SL was performed using a mirVana Kit with phenol (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After RNA isolation, samples were stored at \u201380\u00b0C. RNA samples were analyzed using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Thermo Scientific, USA) for purity evaluation (260 nm/280 nm) and quantification.\n\n\nReal-time PCR for miR-148a\nTo confirm the upregulation of miR-148a in dogs with CanL [22], real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed. cDNA production was performed using the miScript RT II kit (Qiagen, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 1 \u03bcg of RNA was used for each sample with the 5x miScript Hiflex Buffer in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl. The mix was incubated for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by 5 min at 95\u00b0C to inactivate the miScript reverse transcriptase. Next, qPCR was performed using a commercially available specific primer for the Canis familiaris miR-148a and the endogenous reference RNA SNORD96A (miScript, Qiagen) [21,22]. The SYBR Green system (miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit, Qiagen) was used in a real-time thermal cycler (Mastercycler-Ep realplex-4S, Eppendorf). Amplification conditions consisted of an initial activation step of 95\u00b0C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 70\u00b0C for 30 seconds (for denaturation, annealing, and extension, respectively). A standard curve was generated for miRNA analysis using a serial dilution of a pool of cDNAs (maximum and minimum concentration of 0.163 ng/\u03bcL and 0.25468x10-2 ng, consecutively, measured using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit following manufacture instructions in spectrophotometer (Qubit, Thermo Scientific, USA) and obtained a linear amplification of 0.955 (S5 Table). Relative gene expression of miR-148a was performed by converting the sample cycle threshold values to a concentration (ng/\u03bcl) based on the standard curves and we divided the mean of this values by means values of SNORD96A. Individual CT values of miR-148a, SNORD96A and relative miR-148a expression which of dogs are describe in S6 Table. All samples were run in duplicate. Meltin curve showed single peaks for each target (S2 Fig).\n\n\nTransfection with miR-148a mimic and inhibitor in SL\nSplenic leukocytes were cultured (1.6 x 105 cells/replicate) in 24-well plates in triplicate, for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Reagents Scrambled (All Stars Negative control siRNA Qiagen, USA) (5 nM), miR-148a mimic (5 nM), and miR-148a inhibitor (50 nM) (miScript miRNA mimic and inhibitor Qiagen, USA) was used, and SL was transfected using 3 \u03bcL of Hiperfect (Qiagen, USA) in each well, following manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nTo evaluate transfection rates, Cell Death Control (AllStars HS siRNA Qiagen, USA) was used at a final concentration of 50 nM. According to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, the fluorescence rate was measured using flow cytometry with 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, USA). Cell death was measured using trypan blue in a Neubauer chamber and optical microscopy. A medium transfection rate of 20% was obtained for both groups.\n\n\nFlow cytometry analysis of SL\nFor flow cytometry analysis, 1 x 104 of SL were incubated with Fc blocking buffer (10% of FBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Splenic leukocytes was centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 7 minutes and then incubated with anti-dog MHC class II conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Bio-Rad, USA) or mouse anti-dog CD3/FITC (Bio-Rad) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The SL incubated with MHC class II were also marked with anti-mouse CD80 monoclonal antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) (Biolegend) or rabbit anti-mouse iNOS polyclonal/PE (Byorbit) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Splenic leukocytes incubated with mouse anti-dog CD3/FITC were marked with mouse anti-human GATA-3 monoclonal/PE (Biolegend) or mouse anti-human T-bet monoclonal/PE (Biolegend) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Finally, anti-MHCII/CD80, MHCII/iNOS, CD3/T-bet, and CD3/GATA-3 double-tagged SL were analyzed.\nAnti-CD80 and anti-iNOS antibodies possess predicted reactivity described in datasheets. Anti-GATA-3 and anti-T-bet antibody are between humans (GenBank, accession # NP_037483 and CAA38877) and dogs (XP_548164 and XP_005617214, 93% and 96%, respectively). To avoid non-specific binding, cells were incubated with their respective control isotypes.\nFor parasite load quantification, we used a previously described method [30] with modifications. After 48 h in culture, cells were harvested and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature in 1x PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma). Then, they were centrifuged at 400 g for 5 minutes, and permeabilization of the membrane and the parasitophorous vacuole was performed by resuspending the cells in ethanol (Sigma) for 60 minutes at \u201320\u00b0C. Cells were washed with 2% BSA in PBS 1x and incubated for 60 minutes at 4\u00b0C with anti-LPG-Leishmania monoclonal antibody (ABD, Serotec) diluted 1:250. After three consecutive washes with PBS/BSA, amastigotes were stained with 1 \u03bcM of anti-IgG2a conjugated to PE (Sigma) and with monoclonal antibody anti-human CD14 conjugated to FITC (Bio-Rad) for 60 min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed in PBS/BSA buffer and stored at 4\u00b0C in the dark until analysis. All acquisitions were counted in 10,000 events by experimental replicates on channels FL1 and FL2, and cytometric analysis was performed using an Accuri C5 Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) with BD Accuri C6 software, version 1.0.264.21 (BD Biosciences, USA).\n\n\nCapture ELISA for TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 quantification\nAfter 48 h of transfection, supernatants from the cultured SL were collected, centrifuged at 2500 rpm, and stored at \u201380\u00b0C until analysis. According to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, cytokine measurements were performed using DuoSet ELISA Development Systems kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were subjected to normality tests (D\u2019Agostino & Pearson omnibus, Shapiro-Wilk, and Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov), and non-parametric tests were used. The miR148, CD80, CD3, GATA-3, MHCII, iNOS, and T-bet expressions were compared in SL between control and infected groups using the Mann-Whitney test. After transfection of SL with mimics and inhibitors of miR-148a, CD80, CD3, GATA-3, MHCII, iNOS, and T-bet expression were evaluated using the Friedman test with Dunn multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. GraphPad Prism 6 (Graph Pad Software, Inc. CA. USA) was used to perform data analysis.",

Splenic leukocytes from control (healthy dogs) and CanL (dogs naturally infected by L. infantum) groups, were maintained in culture for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 without any treatment and, posteriorly, were marked with monoclonal antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes for analyze by flow cytometry. Bars represent expression median values of CD80/MHCII (9177 and 2818), CD3 (3144 and 8816) and GATA-3/CD3 (3397 and 3971), 25th percentile interquartile range of CD80/MHCII (3802 and 2103), CD3 (2684 and 5565) and GATA-3/CD3 (1979 and 3661) and 75th percentile interquartile range of CD80/MHCII (10,389 and 4,109), CD3 (3406 and 15616) and GATA-3/CD3 (3533 and 4931) from control and CanL groups, respectively. Symbols represent data from individual animals. Asterisks represent significant differences (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.01 (A), p = 0.007 (B), p = 0.007 (C)). Representative histogram of overlay protein expression analysis showed significant differences: CD80/MHC (a), CD3 (b), and GATA-3/CD3 (c) between control (red) and infected (purple) groups.\n\n\nmiR-148a mimic transfection decreases iNOS expression in CanL\nFollowing confirmation that miR-148a was increased in SL from dog with CanL, we investigated the role of this miR through transfection with a mimic and an inhibitor of miR-148a. Transfected SL were cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 48 h, when the expression of proteins, MHCII, CD80, iNOS, CD3, T-bet, and GATA-3 was evaluated using flow cytometry. We did not find significant differences in the control group following treatment with mimic or inhibitor of miR-148a (S4 Fig). In contrast, in the CanL group, miR-148a mimic reduced iNOS in MHCII+ leukocytes compared to scrambled (SCR) (Fig 3). Expression of MHCII, CD80 in MHCII+ leukocytes, CD3, T-bet in TCD3+ leukocytes, and GATA-3 in TCD3+ leukocytes did not vary between treatments in the infected group (S5 Fig).\niNOS expression was evaluated in SL from CanL group (dogs naturally infected by L. infantum) transfected with miR-148a mimic or inhibitor, or SCR and maintained in culture for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Posteriorly, SL were marked with monoclonal antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes for analyze by flow cytometry. Bars represent iNOS expression median values (45099, 20237 and 63677), 25th (7064, 6716 and 9194) and 75th (115028, 136904 and 280471) percentile interquartile range of mimic, inhibitor and SCR treatments, respectively. Symbols represent data from individual animals. Asterisks represent significant differences (Friedman test with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test, p = 0.008).\n\n\nCanine leishmaniasis regulates TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression in supernatants of cultured SL\nWe compared TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-1\u03b2 levels in cultured SL supernatants from dogs of control and CanL groups to investigate immune response modulation during CanL. We observed that dogs with CanL presented increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 (Fig 4A) and IL-1\u03b2 (Fig 4B), whereas IL-6 and IL-12 did not differ between groups (S6 Fig).\nTNF-\u03b1 (A) and IL-1\u03b2 (B) were quantified, by capture ELISA, in SL supernatants cultures from control (dogs without L. infantum infection) and CanL (dogs naturally infected by L. infantum) groups. Splenic leukocytes were maintained in culture for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2, without treatment. Bars represent concentration median values of TNF-\u03b1 (2.51 and 10.81) and IL-1\u03b2 (0.0 and 15.70), 25th percentile interquartile range of TNF-\u03b1 (1.18 and 6.49) and IL-1\u03b2 (0.0 and 6.238) and 75th percentile interquartile range of TNF-\u03b1 (12.89 and 24.80) and IL-1\u03b2 (0.0 and 15.70) from control and CanL groups, respectively.

Asterisks represent significant differences (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.04 (A and B).\n\n\nmiR-148a mimic transfection decreases TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12 concentration during CanL\nTo determine whether miR-148a regulates TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-1\u03b2 production, we compared these cytokines in SL culture supernatants from control and CanL groups after transfection with miR-148a mimic or inhibitor. We did not find significant differences in the control group regardless of treatment (S7 Fig). However, in the CanL group, TNF-\u03b1 (Fig 5A), IL-6 (Fig 5B), and IL-12 (Fig 5C) concentrations were lower in the presence of miR-148a mimic than in the SCR transfection. IL-1\u03b2 production did not differ significantly between transfection conditions in the CanL group (S8 Fig).\nTNF-\u03b1 (A), IL-6 (B), and IL-12 (C) were quantified in SL supernatants cultures from CanL group (dogs naturally infected by L. infantum) and transfected with miR-148a mimic or inhibitor, or SCR in the presence of Hiperfect following 48 h in the culture at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.

Symbols represent data from individual animals. Asterisks represent significant differences (Friedman with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test, p = 0.03 (A), p = 0.01 (B), p = 0.007 (C)).\n\n\nInhibition of miR-148a reduces parasitic load in SL culture from dogs with CanL\nTo determine whether miR-148a plays a role in regulating L. infantum infection, we measured parasitic load using flow cytometry in SL transfected with miR-148a mimic and inhibitor. We found that inhibition of miR-148a reduced parasitic load (Fig 6).\nThe parasitic load was quantified in splenic leukocyte cultures of dogs naturally infected by L. infantum and transfected with miR-148a mimic, miR-148a inhibitor, and SCR transfection control in the presence of Hiperfect following 48 h in the culture at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.

    "Discussion": "Immune responses observed in naturally infected dogs with symptomatic L. infantum are characterized by effective cellular response suppression, which may be related to an increase in miRs such as miR-148a. To investigate the role of miR-148a in CanL, we analyzed miR148a targets after transfection of SL from naturally infected dogs by L. infantum with a mimic and inhibitor of this miR. In silico analysis allowed for identifying miR-148a targets, including CD80, iNOS, T-bet, GATA-3, and pro-inflammatory cytokines [22].\nWe observed reduced expression of CD80 and higher levels of CD3, GATA-3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in dogs with CanL (infected group) than in uninfected dogs (control group). Following transfection, there was increased action of miR-148a (with the help of mimics) that reduced iNOS expression in leukocytes and TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12 in the supernatants of cultured SL from the infected group. Inhibition of miR-148a reduced parasitic load, suggesting a regulatory role for this miR in immune responses to CanL.\nWe did not observe changes in MHCII expression in SL between infected cells and control. Similar results were observed in L. infanutm infected canine macrophages [31]. The MHCII molecule plays a crucial role in adaptive immune response development via antigenic peptide presentation to T lymphocytes [32,33]; however, MHCII expression does not appear to be affected in CanL.\nWe observed less CD80+/MHCII+ expression in dogs in the infected group than in the control group. CD80 is a positive co-stimulatory molecule that determines adaptive immune response [18,33], and its absence is involved in T lymphocyte anergy or apoptosis [34] observed during CanL [12]. Another study indicated that CD80 mRNA expression is unaffected in monocyte-derived macrophages from symptomatic dogs with CanL [18]. Thus, these results suggests a development of negative post-transcriptional regulation of CD80. Low expression of this molecule can impair antigen presentation by antigen presentation cells (APC) and result in ineffective immune response resulting in disease progression.\nIn CanL, iNOS expressed by macrophages in the spleen was negatively associated with parasitic load, suggesting possible deregulation of this molecule in the disease, ensuring the stability of the protozoan in infected cells [16]. In fact, we observed decrease of iNOS expression in SL from the infected group following transfection with mimic suggesting miR-148a participation in regulation of this molecule. Our study is the first to report miR-148a participation in iNOS regulation in CanL, suggesting that this miR interferes with canine immune responses to Leishmania, as previously observed with miR-21 [22].\nSplenic leukocytes from the infected group showed greater expression of CD3 than the control group. A similar result was observed in other tissues of dogs severely affected by leishmaniasis [35,36]. The observed increase in CD3 during CanL, suggests that there are a proliferation of T cells, however, this cells are not developing a leishmanicidal effective function, with possible downregulation of critical proteins for inducing cell-type immune responses, contributing to disease progression in dogs. Therefore, miR-148a regulation did not change CD3 expression in our work, probably there is no relation of this miR with overexpression of this molecule during CanL.\nAlthough, CD3 was up-expressed in CanL, expression of the transcription factor T-bet in CD3+ lymphocytes did not vary between groups in our study, unlike the increase of this transcription factor previously reported in skin [37] and spleen [8] of dogs with CanL. T-bet is related to Th1-type responses and is associated with protozoan [38] and in L. infantum [39] infection resistance. However, there is an imbalance between Th1/Th2 responses, already evidenced in CanL [11,40\u201342], which may explain the lack of difference in T-bet expression we observed, reinforcing the idea\u200b of effective immune response suppression in CanL [37].\nOn the other hand, we observed increased GATA-3 expression in CD3+ lymphocytes from the infected group. GATA-3 mRNA expression is observed in the spleens of dogs in the first month following experimental infection with L. infantum, with detection of Th2-type cytokine mRNA (i.e., IL-4) [8]. Transcription factor GATA-3 (a precursor of Th2-type responses) is responsible for anti-inflammatory cytokine production that can lead to control of clinical signs, not necessarily accompanied by disease control [37] and is therefore associated with disease progression [41]. Our results reinforce the modulation hypothesis of immune response in CanL [11,40\u201342]. Increased or decreased miR-148a did not alter T-bet and GATA-3 expression in CD3+ lymphocytes in the infected group, suggesting that miR-148a does not participate in these transcription factors regulation.\nThe increased TNF-\u03b1 observed in the infected SL supernatants confirms the involvement of this cytokine, already evidenced in CanL [9] associated with host resistance [37,43]. However, TNF-\u03b1 decreased in transfected SL culture supernatants after mimic transfection with miR-148a in the infected group, although, is not known if miR-148a has a direct or indirect action. Mouse dendritic cells LPS-stimulated presented similar result [24], confirming the participation of miR-148a in the downregulation of TNF-\u03b1. Our study is the first to show the relation of TNF-\u03b1 expression and miR-148a in CanL.\nThe disease in dogs did not alter IL-6 levels in SL culture supernatants, as reported in previous studies [44]; however, high IL-6 mRNA expression was found in canine spleens [45]. Taken together, these results suggest post-transcriptional regulation of this cytokine in leishmaniasis, contributing for parasite replication in the host, because, interleukin 6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that participates in immune responses, parasite control, and tissue repair [46], therefore, their reduction can be one reason for disease susceptibility. In our study, supernatant concentrations of IL-6 decreased in SL transfected with mimic miR-148a, similar to a previous report in mouse dendritic cells [24], than, these findings suggest that miR-148a is related with IL-6 negatively regulation. We are the first to demonstrate miR-148a regulation interferes in IL-6 in CanL.\nInterleukin 12 in SL supernatants did not differ between groups in our study. IL-12 mRNA was absent in in vitro infected L. infantum canine macrophages [18] and in spleens of L. infantum naturally infected dogs [8]. Interleukin 12 is an essential cytokine for differentiation of Th1 lymphocytes [11]; in dogs with CanL, it was negatively related to parasitic load and was suppressed by the excess of parasites [15,37]. In our study, IL-12 decreased in SL transfected with miR-148a mimic in the infected group. This result suggests that IL-12 mRNA is a target of miR-148a. There are no previous studies reporting the relationship between IL-12 and miR-148a in CanL; however, it has been observed that inhibition of miR21 in CanL leads to restoration of the concentration of this cytokine and reduction in parasitic load [22], suggesting that more than one miR could modulate this cytokine.\nIn our study, IL-1\u03b2 increased in the supernatants of SL from naturally infected dogs, confirming previous results and its role in CanL [44]. IL-1\u03b2 derived from antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is an essential pro-inflammatory cytokine to induce Th1 immune response [47,48]; however, its overabundant production can result in tissue damage [47]. Transfection with miR-148a in SL did not alter IL-1\u03b2 concentrations in supernatants, suggesting that miR-148a does not contribute for regulation of this cytokine in CanL.\nInterestingly, although inhibition of miR-148a did not alter cytokine concentration observed in this study, it resulted in reduction of parasitic load in SL in the CanL group. We showed, in vitro, that inhibition of miR-148a played an important role in leishmanicidal activity, however, the mechanisms involved should be better explored, like an IFN-\u03b3 dosage, because their parasite killing and macrophage function that already know in CanL [31]. Previously, parasite load reduction was also observed with the inhibition of miR21 [22], suggesting that parasitic load control is multifactorial and appears to be regulated by more than one miRNA in L. infantum infected dogs.\nDecreased iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12 levels after miR-148a mimic transfection in SL suggests a negative regulatory role of this miR, which can act directly or indirectly in immune responses to infection by L. infantum. To elucidate the biological function of downregulated cytokines in CanL, it would be compelling to neutralize TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12 and observe whether they influence parasitic load.\nThe decreased parasitic load in SL following the use of the miR-148a inhibitor suggests a critical role for this miR in developing microbicidal activity in CanL. We conclude that miR-148a regulates immune response as demonstrated by reducing iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12 after miR increase. It plays an essential role in the adaptive response, as demonstrated by the reduction in parasitic load following its inhibition."
