Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis caused by inhalation of fungi belonging to the genus Paracoccidioides. It is endemic in Latin America, mainly affects rural workers and is still a neglected disease. In most cases, it affects multiple organs at the same time, mainly lungs, skin and mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract, while involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is rare. We report a case misdiagnosed as inflammatory bowel disease (CrohnÂ´s disease). The immunosuppressive therapy led to the worsening of existing symptoms, to the involvement of other organs and then the correct diagnosis of PCM was revealed. The reported case demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis of this mycosis and the risk of starting immunosuppressive therapy in these patients. Furthermore, the place of residence and period in which the patient presented the disease coincides with recent changes in the epidemiology of the disease in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
