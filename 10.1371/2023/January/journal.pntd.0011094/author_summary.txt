Protective immunity against tuberculosis (TB) requires a Th-1 response with cytokines like TNF and IFN-γ which plays a key role in the recruitment and activation of immune cells. Helminth infection, on the other hand, can lead to induction of regulatory T cells and a Th-2 skewed response decreasing IFN-γ in T cells. Decreased Th-1 responses could favor reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI), although the helminth species-specific effect on IFN-γ+CD4+ T cells and the link to TB disease severity in patients with active pulmonary TB (PTB) have not been fully investigated. Therefore, blood cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls, LTBI individuals, and PTB patients were used to evaluate the impact of different helminths on the frequency of IFN-γ+CD4+ T cells, in Gondar Ethiopia. Ascaris lumbricoides, Schistosoma mansoni, and hookworm infection in healthy controls contributed equally to decreasing the frequency of IFN-γ+CD4+ T cells, whereas in both LTBI and PTB patients S. mansoni coinfection had the greatest impact on reducing IFN-γ producing capacity of T cells. Decreased IFN-γ producing capacity of T cells was correlated with increased TB disease severity, only in helminth coinfected PTB patients, and anti-helminthic therapy restored the IFN-γ producing capacity of T cells at the 2 months follow-up.
