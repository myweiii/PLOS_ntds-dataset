Dengue fever is a vector-borne viral disease endemic to tropical and subtropical countries. The virus is transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes and affects approximately 100 million people every year. Although most infections are mild or asymptomatic, some may cause severe symptoms, leading to a higher risk of death. In the affected countries, the challenges associated with preventing and controlling dengue outbreaks have highlighted the need for novel tools. In this context, using statistical tools with climate and epidemiological information makes it possible to provide timely information to public health officials about the risk of dengue outbreaks, allowing the optimization of resources and preventive and non-reactive decision-making.
