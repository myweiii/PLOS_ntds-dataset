Rift Valley fever is an important mosquito-borne zoonotic virus that can also be transmitted directly to humans via infected livestock. There has never been an urban outbreak of RVF, however, other arboviruses have caused devastating urban outbreaks driven by urban transmission cycles in vectors. This qualitative study aimed to explore and understand the potential risk of Rift Valley fever in the urban context from the perspective of high risk groups. RVF has a complex epidemiology and urban centers of endemic regions may be particularly vulnerable as they import large quantities of livestock for slaughter and milk to meet the high urban demand for animal sourced foods and have dense host and vector populations. This qualitative study provides insights from the opinions and lived experiences of urban high risk groups including slaughterhouse affiliates, livestock owners, and veterinarians. We also demonstrate risks specific to RVFV transmission and regulatory vulnerabilities that would impact the ability to detect RVF disease introduction. The results of this study are intended to guide future initiatives aiming to investigate urban potential of RVF and infer how urban disease ecology could differ from what has been previously demonstrated in rural areas.
