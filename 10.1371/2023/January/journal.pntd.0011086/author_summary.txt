Diseases that can be transmitted between human beings and other domestic and/or wild animals are a growing concern to communities and other public health stakeholders. These diseases (zoonoses) can be found in the animal or human populations but interaction between humans and animals, especially at the Human-Livestock-Wildlife interfaces leads to transmission of these diseases between ecosystems. The socio-economic and health burden arising from the zoonoses are mostly experienced among poor communities with limited resources for early detection, control and management of the zoonoses in humans and animal. Implementation of control strategies for zoonoses have largely been left to the governments, though community members can play a role too. This perception is largely due to poor direct participation or inclusion of the communities in disease surveillance and control. This study identified community perceptions on zoonotic diseases and performed a qualitative risk assessment for people exposed to zoonotic pathogens. Our findings could be useful in designing integrated community-based strategies for surveillance and control of zoonotic disease at the human-livestock-wildlife interfaces.
