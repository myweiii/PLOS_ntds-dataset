We found an association between Babesia microti infection and both red blood cell RhD and B antigens. Numerous studies have quantified the impact of ABO blood type on Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection, an intraerythrocytic pathogen in the same Apicomplexa phylum as Babesia. For example, type O blood has been noted to protect against severe malaria, which may explain why type O is prevalent in Pf-endemic regions. Studies of ABO and RhD blood types and B. microti infection are lacking. The American Red Cross has a large blood donor dataset from B. microti-endemic states that can be used to study how ABO and RhD blood types are linked to B. microti infection, as measured by the presence of B. microti 18S rRNA. Data from 10 B. microti-endemic states showed that B. microti-infected blood donors were significantly less likely to be RhD+ (OR 0.82, p-value 0.024) than RhD- donors. A review of babesiosis patients admitted to Yale New Haven Hospital between 2011 and 2021 revealed that RhD+ patients were significantly less likely than RhD- patients to have a high (>5%) peak parasitemia (p = 0.017), which correlates with disease severity. Thus, the RhD antigen on the RBC membrane may decrease the risk of B. microti infection and disease severity. The blood type B antigen may affect the frequency of B. microti infection. The odds ratios (ORs) of B. microti infection in blood donors for blood type B compared to non-type B were 2.49 (p = 0.008) in Maine and 2.07 (p = 0.009) in New Jersey, but 0.32 (p = 0.02) in Pennsylvania. Future studies should quantify the impact of RhD, ABO, and other RBC antigens on Babesia infection, and the mechanisms by which they impact RBC invasion and babesiosis severity.
