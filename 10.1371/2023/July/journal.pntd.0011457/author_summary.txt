Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is particularly associated with poverty and living in a rural area, where disease transmitting mosquito vectors thrive. To better understand the socio-economic and environmental factors associated with the LF morbidity prevalence distribution in Bangladesh, this study examined publicly available data and used descriptive, statistical, and mapping methods to highlight key associations. Results found that high risk populations were those living in rural areas, employed in agriculture, with high levels of poverty, and houses without electricity or toilets, and where temperatures in the rainy season were lower than other regions of the country. These findings will help to inform public health messages and implement interventions for people affected by LF morbidity, but also to help reduce any current and future risk of transmission. This will support progress to achieving WHO elimination targets, leading to a future free of suffering for people affected by LF associated morbidity.
