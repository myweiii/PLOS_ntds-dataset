The WHO strategy for the prevention and control of snakebite envenoming identified community engagement and empowerment as a key pillar in meeting the target of halving death and disability by 2030. However, community members’ priorities are rarely considered in the design of health research and treatment approaches. This study focussed on describing the needs, experiences and priorities of community members and healthcare workers in two high snakebite prevalence regions in Ghana. Our findings reflect similar priorities to those identified by the WHO but also highlight other community needs that are not emphasised by the research community. The community members’ priorities include management of the bite site, pain, rehabilitation and mental health support whereas the healthcare workers prioritised training of health professionals, development of local standard treatment protocols and clinical investigations on the efficacy of antivenoms. Exploration of the efficacy of traditional medicines and the identification of traditional and allopathic synergistic treatment approaches were prioritised by both community members and the healthcare workers. Engaging and empowering communities in the research agenda setting process will help guide the conduct of priority research needed to improve the outcome and quality of life of snakebite victims.
