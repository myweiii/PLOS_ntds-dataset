The extent and population burden of the Zika and Chikungunya epidemics in Northeast Brazil remains speculative since seroprevalence studies have often been restricted to specific populations and limited by ZIKV and DENV antibody cross-reactivity. Here we conducted a seroepidemiological study in the city of Recife, a metropolitan area in Northeast Brazil using a design stratified by socioeconomic status (SES). We determined the sensitivity and specificity of the assays using a panel of well-characterized samples from the study area and determined optimum cut-offs, which were later validated by selecting a subset of samples that were used to conduct viral neutralizations assays. The results indicated that 89% of the population (older than 5 years of age) had previous dengue infection, which is compatible with our previous serosurvey. Correcting for the sensitivity and specificity of the ZIKV assays, the overall ZIKV IgG seroprevalence was 34.6%, which indicates high transmission during the first outbreak (2015/2016). Interestingly, the age and the SES distribution profiles of ZIKV and CHIKV seroprevalence were remarkably different. This difference cannot be explained by differences in mosquito exposure alone. Future research will need to be conducted to better explain the differences found in the age distributions.
