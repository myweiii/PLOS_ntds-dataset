We remain indebted to NTD programme in Cameroon at National, Regional and District levels and the community, including the semi-nomads who supported the activities. We are thankful to the Centre for Research on Filariasis and other Tropical Diseases (CRFilMT) for collecting and analysing samples. We are equally thankful to Alexandre Chailloux for developing GIS tools and drawing the maps.
