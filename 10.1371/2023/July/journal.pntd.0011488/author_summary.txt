Dabie bandavirus (DBV) is an emerging tick-borne virus with up to 30% case fatality rates in human. Macrophage exhaustion and cytokine storms are essential for the development of fatal SFTS. However, the mechanisms by which DBV induces macrophagic cell death and causes excessive inflammatory response remain poorly explored. Here, we first demonstrate caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis in human macrophages, a formerly unknown mechanism to facilitate hose defense against DBV infection. DBV-induced pyroptotic cell death was evidenced by pore-forming structures, increased release of LDH and expression of pyroptosis-related proteins. More importantly, platelets protected macrophages from pyroptosis, by attenuating the gene expressions of pyroptosis-related markers and inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. Taken together, our study provides unique perspective on macrophagic cell death pathways in SFTS and identifies a novel function of platelets, which may provide potential treatment options for DBV-related diseases.
