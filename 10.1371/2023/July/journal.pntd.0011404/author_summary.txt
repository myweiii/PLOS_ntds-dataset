Alphaviruses, such as chikungunya virus, are mosquito-borne viruses that cause various diseases in humans and other animals. When they infect a cell, they hijack the plasma membrane to generate dedicated genome-replicating organelles called spherules. Spherules contain the negative strand “template” to make more positive-strand viral RNA. The template is present in a double-stranded duplex form (dsRNA) with a positive strand RNA. Here, we used cryo-electron tomography and computational methods to study how the dsRNA organizes inside spherules. We find that the dsRNA is more strongly bent than it would be outside a spherule. This is measured by the so-called “persistence length”, which can be seen as the distance over which a polymer is roughly straight. For free dsRNA the literature reports this as 63 nm, but we measure 22 nm in spherules. We corroborated this by a method called subtomogram averaging which reveals a handful prevalent conformations of dsRNA in spherules. We further showed that dsRNA is evenly distributed inside the spherule, and has a certain degree of preferred orientation with respect to the protein machinery that replicates it, the so-called neck complex.
