High throughput sequencing has become a powerful tool for the epidemiological study of the rabies virus. Considering the lack of information from the two geographic areas included in the present research, a collection of samples from 2012 to 2017 from both domestic and wild animals positive for rabies was used to study the circulation of rabies virus variants. The aim was to better understand their distribution in Moldova and north-eastern Romania, two neighbouring countries. Sanger and high throughput sequencing on Ion Torrent and Illumina platforms were used. A single phylogenetic group, revealing the common past evolutionary history of the species, was identified. The phylogenetic group is called north-eastern Europe (NEE) and samples clustered into three assigned lineages RO#5, RO#6 and RO#7. High throughput sequencing on samples from both domestic and wild animals was performed for the first time for both countries, providing new insights into RABV evolution and epidemiology in these areas and expanding our understanding of the disease.
