Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease affecting some sub-Saharan Africa countries. Although HAT elimination can be considered as achieved in some foci, the interruption of its transmission by 2030 remains a challenge. Animal reservoir and skin-dwelling trypanosomes have emerged as factors that can compromise sustainable elimination of HAT. It is in this light that T. b. gambiense infections and different trypanosome species were identified in blood and skin of domestic and wild animals from two HAT foci of the forest region of Cameroon. For this study, blood and skin snip samples were collected from domestic and wild animals. Molecular tools were used to identify different trypanosome species. Several trypanosome species including trypanosomes of the subgenus Trypanozoon, T. vivax and T. congolense were detected in the blood and skin of several animal taxa. Immuno-histochemical tools confirmed trypanosome infections in the skin. Pigs, sheep, goats and wild animals were confirmed as potential animal reservoirs of T. b. gambiense. Results of this study highlighted the necessity of considering animal reservoirs as well as skin-dwelling trypanosomes in the designing of new control strategies that will lead to the interruption of HAT transmission by 2030.
