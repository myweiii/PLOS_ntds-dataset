We would like to thank the agro-pastoralist and pastoralist communities in this study and especially the mothers of the children who allowed their children to participate. Many thanks go to local guides in finding the pastoralist camps, the data collectors, and the laboratory staff at Jigjiga University: Fuad, Ahmed, Dek, Mohammed Hussien, Mohammed Askari, Mohamoud, and countless others. Additional thanks to the Jigjiga One Health Initiative team at Jigjiga University and the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Ethiopia and the Human and the Animal Health Unit team at Swiss Tropical Public Health Institute in Switzerland.
