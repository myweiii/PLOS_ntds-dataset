Intestinal parasitic infections remain a silent threat to the health and life-trajectories of children living in areas with inadequate access to clean water, proper sanitation, and hygiene facilities, including the Somali Regional State of Ethiopia. A large majority in this region live as pastoralists (semi-mobile animal herders), in close contact with their animals and nature, at risk for climate-related threats like drought and flooding, and at risk for infectious agents like intestinal parasites. We assessed the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in pastoralist children in the Adadle district of the Somali Regional State of Ethiopia (ESRS), and the individual and household-level factors associated with these infections. We found that locally collected water, shared toilets, along with ownership of cows and chickens increased the risk for having an intestinal parasitic infection with Giardia intestinalis, which can cause diarrhea and is transmitted through water, food, and soil that have been contaminated by the feces of infected humans and animals. If access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure is not improved, these infections remain recurrent in these communities and their animals, continually affecting the health of children. This study is one of few involving pastoralists in this region, hopefully lending guidance to regional public health policies.
