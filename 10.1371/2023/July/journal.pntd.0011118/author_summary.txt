Chagas disease (ChD) is a neglected tropical disease, and the diagnosis relies on blood testing of patients from endemic areas. However, there is no clear recommendation on how to select patients for testing in endemic regions. Since most cases of Chronic ChD are asymptomatic, the diagnostic rates are low, preventing patients from receiving adequate treatment.
The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely available, low-cost exam, often available in primary care settings. We present an Artificial intelligence (AI) model for automatically detecting ChD from the ECG. AI algorithms have allowed the detection of hidden conditions on the ECG and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that does it for ChD. We utilize large cohorts of patients from the relevant population of all-comers in affected regions in Brazil to develop a model for ChD detection that is then validated on datasets with ground truth labels obtained directly from the patientsâ€™ serological status.
Our findings demonstrate a promising AI-ECG-based model for discriminating patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). The capacity of detecting ChD patients without CCC is still limited. But we believe this can be improved with the addition of epidemiological questions, and that such models can become useful tools for pre-selecting patients for further testing.
