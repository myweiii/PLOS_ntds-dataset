Plasmodium vivax generally receives less attention than P. falciparum and was neglected in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the characteristics of P. vivax infection in Duffy-negative individuals, and the distribution of Duffy blood group in different eco-epidemiological zones and ethnic groups of Ethiopia are not well documented. Here, we determined the Duffy genotypes of P. vivax infected patients across broad regions of Ethiopia. It is clear that Duffy negative individuals in Ethiopia are not fully protected against P. vivax infection, and that these infections in Duffy negatives are often associated with low parasitemia. Our findings lend support to the notion that P. vivax may have developed a Duffy-independent erythrocyte invasion pathway and/or evolution in host immune responses.
