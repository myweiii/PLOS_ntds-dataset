Trachoma is the most common infectious cause of blindness worldwide. Achieving elimination in resource-limited settings requires pragmatic strategies, including determining the likelihood that the elimination prevalence targets have been reached. Model-based geostatistics (MBG) is a branch of spatial statistics that can underpin highly efficient methods for designing surveys and analysing surveillance data for NTD programmes. Here, we illustrate the application of the MBG framework to analyse trachoma surveillance data from Brazil, Malawi, and Niger. Using the elimination criteria set by WHO, we predict the likelihood of elimination thresholds for trachomatous inflammationâ€”follicular (TF) and trachomatous trichiasis (TT) having been achieved in each evaluation unit in each of the three countries. MBG is a statistically rigorous approach to quantify the likelihood around the exceedance of elimination prevalence thresholds. By providing a way to identify areas where there is more uncertainty about the achievement of elimination, MBG could be used to select areas in which more intensive sampling efforts should be undertaken.
