Leprosy remains a key public health concern for WHO, particularly affecting the poorest and most disadvantaged sectors of society in the worldâ€™s least developed countries. The exploration of the mechanism of leprosy nerve injury in order to prevent the occurrence of deformity and disability has aroused great interest and extensive attention of scientists. Although some achievements have been made, as a critical phase for the propagation of M. leprae, events occurring during the early stage of M. leprae infection of human SCs are still poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate SC heterogeneity and biomarkers in different M. leprae infectious stages at a single cell resolution. We established that a stem cell-like cell subpopulation was in the early stage of differentiation and could differentiate into an adipocyte-like cell subpopulation. This research provides a novel perspective on the dynamic process of host cell differentiation and metabolism regulated by M. leprae and thus increase understanding of the mechanisms underlying the causes of disability in leprosy patients as well as identifying potential new therapeutic strategies.
