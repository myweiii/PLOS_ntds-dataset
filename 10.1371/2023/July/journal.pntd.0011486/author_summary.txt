Aedes aegypti is a mosquito species that transmits several arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, etc. This species was originally found in Africa but is now extensive in all the continents except Antarctica. The spread of this species is of concern as the movement of infected mosquitoes can spread the viruses from one place to another. Anthropogenic changes such as climate warming and increasing urbanization are boosting the spread. This study focuses on analyzing the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in India and how it is affected by the local topological and climatic factors. We analyzed Ae. aegypti populations from different geographical regions in India covering the parts from North to South and East to West and analyzed them using a panel of microsatellite markers. Our analysis suggested that Ae. aegypti populations in India are genetically closer to each other irrespective of geographical distance between them which indicates high gene flow among the populations. However, signs of genetic structure were also observed owing to the factors associated with geographical locations. This research provides a broader picture of the nature and dynamics of the mosquito populations among eco-geographical regions across a larger area of the country, which would provide a valuable reference base for genetic studies and for novel mosquito control strategies.
