    "Background": "Schistosomiasis and hookworm infection remain public health problems in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The epidemiology of schistosomiasis and hookworm was studied in seasonal transmission settings in the northern part of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.",
    "Methodology": "In August 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted. Urine and stool samples were collected from 742 individuals aged 6\u201396 years in 16 localities from four departments in northern C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Urine samples were examined by a filtration method for quantification of Schistosoma haematobium eggs. Stool samples were subjected to duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and eggs of Schistosoma mansoni and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) were counted. Additionally, a questionnaire was administered to determine demographic characteristics and to identify risk factors of schistosomiasis and STHs. Malacologic surveys were carried out at water points that are contacted by humans and animals.",
    "Principal findings": "The prevalence of schistosomiasis was very low. Only two cases of S. mansoni were found (0.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1\u20131.0%). The distribution of S. haematobium was focal, with cases found only in two departments; Ferkess\u00e9dougou (5.4%, 95% CI: 2.5\u20139.9%) and Ouangolodougou (2.7%, 95% CI: 0.9\u20136.3%). Hookworm was the only STH species observed with a prevalence of 1.5% (95% CI: 0.8\u20132.8%). A higher risk of S. haematobium infection was observed in males compared to females, but the difference was not statistically significant (2.3% versus 1.3%, odds ratio [OR]: 1.5, 95% CI: 0.8\u20132.7). Participants aged 16\u201320 years showed the highest prevalence of S. haematobium. A total of 111 human- and animal-water contact points were identified at 47 water sources. Three potential intermediate host snails of schistosomes were collected; namely, Bulinus forskalii (n = 761), Bulinus truncatus (n = 205), and Biomphalaria pfeifferi (n = 1). Yet, only one specimen of Bu. truncatus was found to be shedding schistosome cercariae.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This study confirms very low transmission of schistosomiasis and hookworm in northern C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The establishment and rigorous implementation of integrated surveillance-response systems could lead to the elimination of schistosomiasis and hookworm in this part of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire."
