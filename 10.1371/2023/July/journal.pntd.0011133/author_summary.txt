Fever-associated infectious diseases are still a major cause of concern in low to middle income countries. Inappropriate treatment of misdiagnosed diseases can contribute to the selection of drug resistant microbes. Therefore, improved diagnostics of febrile patients and specific biomarker discovery to support new diagnostics is desirable. Metabolomics studies can provide the necessary information which leads to the discovery of biomarkers. In this study we have investigated three different metabolomics datasets; including those for malaria, leishmaniasis and Zika virus infection, all associated with fever. We aimed to integrate these metabolomics datasets to determine metabolites which behave in the same way in different infectious diseases. One of the challenges in integrating metabolomics datasets is a non-linear drift which occurs between them in terms of retention time. In this case, we proposed to correct this drift by using a supervised machine learning algorithm called Gaussian Process Regression. Following the integration or alignment of the datasets statistical analysis and annotation of the metabolites was performed. We identified several metabolites which acted in a similar manner across the datasets, specifically those found in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism.
