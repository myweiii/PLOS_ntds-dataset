Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum, anti-parasitic drug that has been administered for decades in the context of preventive chemotherapy programs for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis elimination. Ivermectin is also effective against Strongyloides stercoralis, an intestinal worm causing significant morbidity in low-income countries in tropical and subtropical regions. The World Health Organization recently identified the need to develop guidelines to assist S. stercoralis control in endemic countries. We aimed to study the impact of ivermectin preventive chemotherapy on S. stercoralis prevalence to generate evidence that can inform global health policy. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the available literature, collecting data from studies where ivermectin was administered for control of S. stercoralis or other parasitic infections. The analysis demonstrated a reduction in the prevalence of S. stercoralis in areas where ivermectin was administered. These data may be useful for informing future public health policies.
