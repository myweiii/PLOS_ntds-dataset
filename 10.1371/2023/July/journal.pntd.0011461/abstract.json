    "Abstract": "V. vulnificus is one of the deadliest waterborne pathogens, yet little is known of the ecological and environmental forces that drive outbreaks. As a nationally notifiable disease, all cases of V. vulnificus diagnosed in the United States are reported to the state in which they occurred, as well as to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. Given that the state of Florida is a \u2018hotspot\u2019 for V. vulnificus in the United States, we examined the prevalence and incidence of cases reported to the Florida Department of Health (2008\u20132020). Using a dataset comprised of 448 cases of disease caused by V. vulnificus infection, we identified meteorological variables that were associated with clinical cases and deaths. Combined with data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), we first utilized correlation analysis to examine the linear relationships between satellite meteorological measurements such as wind speed, air temperature, water temperature, and sea-level pressure. We then measured the correlation of those meteorological variables with coastal cases of V. vulnificus, including the outcome, survival, or death. We also constructed a series of logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between temporal and meteorological variables during months that V. vulnificus cases were reported versus months when V. vulnificus cases were not reported. We report that between 2008 and 2020, V. vulnificus cases generally increased over time, peaking in 2017. As water temperature and air temperature increased, so too did the likelihood that infection with V. vulnificus would lead to patient death. We also found that as mean wind speed and sea-level pressure decreased, the probability that a V. vulnificus case would be reported increased. In summary, we discuss the potential factors that may contribute to the observed correlations and speculate that meteorological variables may increase in their public health relevance in light of rising global temperatures."
