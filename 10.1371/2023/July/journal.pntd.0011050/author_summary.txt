We observed rudimentary data on snake bites and a paucity of venom characterization in the health records of patients in health facilities in Ghana. Knowledge of the distribution of snake species across the agro-ecological zones of the country was also limited. We set out to complement this data by doing a structured thematic desk review of peer reviewed papers, books and reports from repositories including PubMed, WHO and the District Health Information Management System (DHIMS) of the Ghana Health Service (GHS).
Our findings revealed that, snake bites were largely grouped according to the activity of the expressed venom into neurotoxic, cardiotoxic, haemorrhagic, cytotoxic, myotoxic and in some documentations nephrotoxic and procoagulants. Neurotoxic snake bites were largely due to cobras and mambas. Snake expressing venoms with cardiotoxic, haemorrhagic, nephrotoxic and procoagulant activities were principally vipers. Snakes with venoms showing myotoxic activity were largely alien to Ghana and the West African sub-region. Venoms showing cytotoxic activity are expressed by a wide range of snakes though more prevalent among vipers.
In Ghana, snakes expressing venoms with neurotoxic and haemorrhagic activities are prevalent across all the agro-ecological zones of the country. We identified 3 antivenoms registered by the Ghana Food and Drug Authority.
