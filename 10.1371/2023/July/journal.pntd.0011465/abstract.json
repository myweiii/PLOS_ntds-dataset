    "Background": "Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) is a neglected disease of the genital tract due to the inflammatory response to the presence of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in the genital tract. The WHO has prioritized the improvement of diagnostics for FGS and previous studies have explored the PCR-based detection of Schistosoma DNA on genital specimens, with encouraging results. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of FGS among women living in an endemic district in North-western Tanzania, using PCR on samples collected though cervical-vaginal swabs, and to compare the performance of self-collected and healthcare worker\u2013collected (operator-collected) samples, and the acceptability of the different sampling methods.",
    "Methods/Principal findings": "A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 211 women living in 2 villages in the Maswa district of North-western Tanzania. Urine, self-collected and operator-collected cervical-vaginal swabs were obtained from participants. A questionnaire was administered, focusing on the comfortability in undergoing different diagnostic procedures. Prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis, as assessed by eggs in urine, was 8.5% (95%CI 5.1\u201313.1). DNA was pre-isolated from genital swabs and transported at room temperature to Italy for molecular analysis. Prevalence of active schistosomiasis, urinary schistosomiasis, and FGS were 10.0% (95% CI 6.3\u201314.8), 8.5% (95%CI 5.1\u201313.1), and 4.7% (95%CI 2.3\u20138.5), respectively. When real-time PCR was performed after a pre-amplification step, the prevalence of active schistosomiasis increased to 10.4% (95%CI 6.7\u201315.4), and FGS to 5.2% (95%CI 2.6\u20139.1). Of note, more cases were detected by self-collected than operator-collected swabs.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The results of this study show that genital self-sampling followed by pre-amplified PCR on room temperature-stored DNA is a useful method from both technical and acceptability point of views. This encourages further studies to optimize samples processing, and identify the best operational flow to allow integration of FGS screening into women health programmes, such as HPV screening."
