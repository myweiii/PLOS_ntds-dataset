Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) is a severe debilitating disease of the female genital tract, caused by infection with Schistosoma haematobium, the agent of urogenital schistosomiasis. It is estimated that FGS affects 20â€“56 million girls and women, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The diagnosis of FGS is currently difficult, and this disease often remains undiagnosed or is misdiagnosed as sexually transmitted diseases or genital cancer, with dramatic health and social consequences for the affected women. The WHO has prioritized the improvement of diagnostics for FGS. In this study, we applied and compared the performance of two genital sampling methods (self-collected and healthcare worker (operator)-collected cervical-vaginal swab) followed by molecular analysis, and assessed their comparative acceptability among 211 women living in a S. haematobium endemic district in North-western Tanzania. We found that not only self-collection by genital swab was well accepted, and actually the preferred sampling method for a high proportion of participants, but that PCR had higher sensitivity when applied to self-collected samples as compared to operator-collected swabs. Furthermore, we used room temperature-stored DNA, which offered greater ease of sample preservation and transportation after extraction. This encourages further studies to optimize samples processing and identify the best operational flow to allow integration of FGS screening into women health programmes, such as HPV screening.
