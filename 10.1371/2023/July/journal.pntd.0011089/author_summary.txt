Schistosomiasis drives host immune responses for optimal pathogen survival, potentially altering host responses to vaccine-related antigen. Chronic schistosomiasis and co-infection with hepatotropic viruses are common in countries where schistosomiasis is endemic. We explored the impact of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) worm burden on Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination of individuals from a fishing community in Uganda. We demonstrate that higher schistosome-specific antigen (circulating anodic antigen, CAA) concentration pre-vaccination, is associated with lower HepB antibody titers post-vaccination at month 7. We show higher pre-vaccination levels of CCL17 in instances of high CAA that negatively associate with HepB antibody titers month 12 post-vaccination and coincided with lower frequencies of circulating T follicular helper cell populations (cTfh), proliferating antibody secreting cells (ASCs), and higher frequencies of regulatory T cells (Tregs). We also show that monocyte function is important in HepB vaccine responses, and high CAA is associated with alterations in the early innate cytokine/chemokine microenvironment. Our findings suggest that in individuals with high CAA and likely high worm burden, schistosomiasis can create an environment that is polarized against optimal host immune responses to the vaccine, which puts many endemic communities at risk for infection against HepB and other diseases that are preventable by vaccines.
