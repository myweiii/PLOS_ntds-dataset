Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis, more common in tropical and subtropical countries. It is endemic in Madagascar and occurs following injury and telluric contamination. We evaluated the therapeutic response to itraconazole in 43 cases of sporotrichosis seen at the reference center in dermatology, Madagascar. At the end of 6th month of itraconazole therapy, the cure rate was 46.5%. Major response to itraconazole was observed in 18.6% of patients. Patients with sporotrichosis onset in less than a year had a high cure rate (27.9%) compared to other patients (18.6%). In this study, high rate of lost to follow-up was found, correlated to the disease duration. Our study highlighted the difficulty encountered during its management.
