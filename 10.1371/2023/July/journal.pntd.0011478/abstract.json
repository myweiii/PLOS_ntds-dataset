    "Introduction": "Sporotrichosis is a subacute to chronic fungal infection of skin and subcutaneous tissues, caused by dimorphic fungi belonging to the genus Sporothrix, commonly seen in tropical and subtropical regions like Madagascar. This study describes the epidemiological, clinical, and the treatment outcomes with itraconazole for sporotrichosis.",
    "Methods": "A descriptive retrospective study on patients suffering from sporotrichosis, from March 2013 to January 2019, was conducted, in the reference center for endemic mycoses. Patients with sporotrichosis who received itraconazole for at least 3 months were included in the study. Patients received itraconazole 200 mg daily for 3 to 6 months. Therapeutic responses were evaluated at months 3 and 6 after treatment. Outcomes were classified as minor response, major response, cure, and failure.",
    "Results": "Forty-three cases of sporotrichosis were included. The median age of patients was 40 years. Most of them (62.8%) were rural workers. Men were more frequently infected (72%). At the end of 6th month of treatment, 20 patients (46.5%) were cured and a major response to itraconazole was observed in 8 patients (18.6%). The cure rate was higher in 12 patients (27.9%) who had disease durations of less than to one year than in those who had more time of disease (18.6%) (p = 0.01). Thirteen patients (30.2%) were lost to follow up. The rate of lost to follow-up was also higher (39.5%) in patients who had sporotrichosis of less than to one year than in those who had more time of disease.",
    "Conclusion": "The cure rate found in this study was inferior to that reported in the literature. However, it was higher in patients with early symptomatology."
