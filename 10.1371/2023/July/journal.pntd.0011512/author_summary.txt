Tsetse habitat is increasingly fragmented owing to anthropogenic pressures and climate shifts which leads to spatial variability of African trypanosomiasis burden. Mapping tsetse occurrence is therefore a useful predictor of disease risk and provides the basis of evidence-based vector control strategies. In this study, we demonstrate the suitability of using the recently developed vehicle-mounted sticky trap for the rapid generation of occurrence records that can be used in ecological niche models to predict the distribution of G. morsitans. Since resources for vector surveillance and control are generally scarce in endemic settings, this alternative survey approach may be more efficient in the identification of priority areas for vector intervention.
