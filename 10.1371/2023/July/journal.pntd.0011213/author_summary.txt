This study explored the barriers to the uptake and coverage of control interventions for soil-transmitted helminths and Schistosomiasis in Nigeria. The study used key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with stakeholders involved in Neglected Tropical Disease school-based control programs, including community members, teachers, parents, and school-aged children. The study found that the main barriers to the uptake and coverage of control interventions for soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis were poor drug acceptability, limited accessibility to drugs, and inadequate knowledge about the diseases and the control interventions. Additionally, the study found that the implementation of Neglected Tropical Disease control programs was inconsistent due to the inadequacy of available support from partners. Overall, our study provides important insights into the barriers and facilitators to Neglected Tropical Disease school-based control programs and highlights the need for improved drug acceptability, accessibility, and knowledge about the diseases and control interventions. Our findings can inform the development of effective interventions to improve the uptake and coverage of control interventions.
