Tick-borne rickettsioses are emerging infectious diseases of public health importance worldwide. Spotted fever rickettsioses (SFG) transmitted by ticks can cause mild to severe human illness depending on the pathogen species and co-morbidities. They present with non-specific symptoms making diagnosis challenging particularly in limited resource settings where there is a lack of effective diagnostic testing. Little is known about the prevalence of Rickettsia in Uganda. Using entomological and molecular tools, we surveyed and studied tick-borne SFG Rickettsia in five districts from four diverse eco-regions of Uganda. Overall, 24.6% (116/471) tick pools were positive for Rickettsia species. Sequencing the 17kDa and ompA genes of Rickettsia revealed R. africae as the most common agent, followed by R. conorii and R. conorii subsp. israelensis. The findings indicate multiple Rickettsia spp. are circulating in the four geographically diverse regions of Uganda that can cause febrile illness in humans. Physicians should be aware of these agents as potential causes of febrile illness in these areas.
