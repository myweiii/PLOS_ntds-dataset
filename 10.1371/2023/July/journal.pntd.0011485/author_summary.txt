Interdisciplinary research on snakebites and the engagement of indigenous and riverine populations of the Amazon are essential for the formulation of innovative and tailored strategies towards achieving the global target of halving the number of deaths and disabilities due to snakebite envenomations by 2030 in Brazil. These populations are key to reducing these poor outcomes since they are disproportionately affected by snakebites. In this work, we evaluated access to medical care in SBE patients and analyzed barriers that prevent victims from accessing healthcare in indigenous villages in two health districts in the Brazilian Amazon. Snakebites were reported in all age groups, including a high rate among children, which demonstrates their great contact with venomous snakes in indigenous villages. A proportion of 12.3% of individuals with a lifetime history of snakebites did not receive hospital treatment, ranging from 4.6% in the Upper Rio Solimões health district to 30.4% in the Upper Rio Negro health district. Availability of pre-hospital emergency transport using motorboats, a greater number of hospitals and better navigability of the Solimões River and its tributaries would make access easier for indigenous people living in this district. We discuss the role that the implementation of cross-cultural hospital care, which considers specific indigenous needs for accommodation and food, may have in reducing the resistance of indigenous populations to seek western treatment for snakebites.
