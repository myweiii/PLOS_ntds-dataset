    "Background": "Over seven decades, Brazil has made admirable progress in controlling schistosomiasis, and a frequent question about the explanation for this reduction refers to the effect of improving environmental factors in the country. This article seeks to identify factors related to the change in the epidemiological situation of schistosomiasis mansoni infection by analyzing three national prevalence surveys conducted since 1950.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "This is an ecological study analyzing an unbalanced panel of data based on national surveys and considering the municipality as the unit of analysis. The sample consisted of 1,721 Brazilian municipalities, in which a total of 1,182,339 schoolchildren aged 7\u201314 were examined during the three periods corresponding to each survey (1947\u20131953, 1975\u20131979, and 2010\u20132015). The percentage of municipalities with zero cases of schistosomiasis was: 45.4%, 54.2% and 73.7%, respectively for those periods. A zero-inflated Poisson regression model, with fixed and random effects, was fitted to assess the association between candidate factors and disease prevalence using a significance level of 5%. There was a significant decrease in disease prevalence between the first and last periods analyzed (RR 0.214, CI 0.184\u20130.249), with a protective association with access to sanitation (RR 0.996, CI 0.994\u20130.998), urbanization (RR 0.991, CI 0.989\u20130.993), and living in own households (RR 0.986, CI 0.983\u20130.989); and an inverse association with piped water supply (RR 1.010, CI 1.008\u20131.011).",
    "Conclusion": "The findings of this study indicate a decrease in the prevalence of schistosomiasis over seven decades in schoolchildren from the analyzed Brazilian municipalities, associated with environmental factors and social conditions. The increased access to piped water in the municipalities apparently triggers other ways of contact with unsafe water bodies, generating new transmission routes and suggesting the need for a systemic approach concerning contact with water."
