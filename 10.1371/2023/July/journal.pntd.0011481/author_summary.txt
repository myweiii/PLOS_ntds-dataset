Iron response regulator (Irr) plays a key role in iron metabolism of Brucella. In this study, the Brucella melitensis M5-90 irr mutant appeared significant different of growth and iron utilization rate compared with that of the Brucella melitensis M5-90 strain. However, the specific binding sites of Irr in Brucella are not fully understood. Here, we used Dap-seq to identify the potential target genes of Irr in the genome of Brucella melitensis M5-90. A total of seven genes were identified as target genes for Irr and the expression of levels of these seven genes were identified using qRT-PCR. In addition, Six out of seven genes namely rirA, membrane protein, hypothetical protein, ftrA, zntA and 2Fe-2S binding protein interact with the Irr protein. Furthermore, the mutation of rirA markedly affected the iron utilization and growth rate of Brucella. Overall, these results provide valuable insights for the exploration of Brucella iron metabolism.
