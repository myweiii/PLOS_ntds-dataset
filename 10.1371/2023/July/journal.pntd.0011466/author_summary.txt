The elimination of schistosomiasis depends critically on the identification of a set of determinants. A site-specific analysis of the determinants allows organizers to adjust and clarify the focus areas for the next round. This analysis, based on anecdotal evidence and investigations specific to a narrow geographic area at a fine scale, would enhance our understanding of the determinants. Especially for areas where elimination goals are to be achieved, local spatial variation in determinants is worth exploring in depth.
In this analysis we included the seropositive rates of schistosomiasis from 1714 villages or communities and established six spatial regression models. Benefiting from determinants with different bandwidths, MGWR was good at simulating schistosomiasis. We also explored the spatial variability of multiple determinants and mapped variability for some key determinants at the village level. We hope the findings will be used for developing precision intervention measure for schistosomiasis control.
