Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are estimated to affect 1.74 billion people globally, often those in low socio-economic communities in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Five NTDs can be effectively treated using repeated administration of preventative chemotherapy (PC), delivered to communities with endemic infection. This is described as mass-drug administration (MDA). Repeated treatment is necessary due to re-infection of treated people by those untreated in these endemic communities, and the absence of strong acquired immunity in the human host to many of the NTDs despite repeated exposure to infection. Increasing the number of people treated at each round is critical to increase the number of parasite-free individuals. As a result, this will reduce the amount of re-infection to the community and therefore increases the chance of reaching the goal of transmission elimination. Currently, the measurement of MDA success is focused upon coverage defined as the receiving of treatment. However, not everyone who receives treatment swallows the treatment, which defines compliance. Reviewing patterns of compliance over time in the population targeted for treatment, such as the proportion of the population which always takes treatment, or conversely never takes treatment, will help predict the impact of MDA on disease prevalence and intensity. This review summarises the results of recent studies recording compliance data for the five NTDs controllable by MDA, soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis and trachoma.
