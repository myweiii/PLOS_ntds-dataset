The world-famous Marrakech souks (markets) are a unique and scarcely studied context where reptiles are in constant contact with humans and used for traditional medicine or for the ancient craft of snake charming. Hence, we aimed to identify the pathogens present in blood and feces of reptiles kept in the markets of Marrakech to assess the zoonotic risk. Animals from vendors or snake charmers were sampled. DNA was extracted and molecularly screened to identify potentially zoonotic pathogens. Overall, 28.9% of reptiles were positive for at least one pathogen. Importantly, we detected Anaplasma spp. from four snakes, Rickettsia spp. from Mediterranean chameleons and puff adders, and Leishmania tarentolae from snakes and chameleons. On the other hand, zoonotic bacteria such Proteus vulgaris were identified from a Mediterranean chameleon, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from Egyptian cobra, and Morganella morganii from puff adder. Thus, reptiles that are kept in the souks of Marrakech may play a role in the zoonotic transmission of pathogens and parasites, given the constant contact with humans.
