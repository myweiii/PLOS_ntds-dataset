Yeasts of the C. haemulonii complex (C. haemulonii sensu stricto, C. duobushaemulonii, C. haemulonii var. vulnera) and related species (C. pseudohaemulonii and C. vulturna), are phylogenetically close to Candida auris, but their distribution, pathophysiology and antifungal resistance profiles are poorly known. This work provides the first epidemiological data on these yeasts in France. Fungemia caused by these yeasts were mainly identified in tropical overseas regions (French West Indies, French Guiana), and occurred in patients with risk factors for candidemia, particularly a cutaneous portal of entry. This work highlights the skin carriage of these yeasts in these tropical regions, and their ability to colonize foreign devices. Like for Candida parapsilosis, catheters are the main pathway for fungemia but mortality seems higher with yeasts of the C. haemulonii complex and related. They commonly show in vitro resistance to many antifungal agents, notably fluconazole and amphotericin B, which are still frequently used as first and second-line treatments for candidemia worldwide. The findings from the literature review are consistent with these overall results. These observations justify closer epidemiological surveillance in the concerned regions to prevent a potential C. auris-like threat.
