This study compares different indicators for the eye disease trachoma before and after two annual rounds of mass azithromycin treatment of affected communities of Kiribati. We saw decreases in the proportion of children with the sign TF (trachomatous inflammation—follicular) that is used by trachoma programs to make decisions about starting and stopping mass treatment, but these decreases were not sufficient to make the decision to stop. We also saw decreases in infection and antibody levels after treatment. The study provides important public health information to Kiribati trachoma programs, but also adds to the growing body of evidence to guide the use of alternative indicators–infection and antibody–to support these programs. Measuring antibody levels in communities over time helps us understand how antibody levels change as community infection prevalence decreases. Understanding antibody dynamics over time can help us better estimate antibody-based thresholds for surveillance after elimination of trachoma as a public health problem.
