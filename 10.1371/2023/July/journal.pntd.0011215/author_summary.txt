Schistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases caused by infection of Schistosoma spp. Currently, in the absence of effective vaccines for schistosomiasis, PZQ is the first line drug chosen for the treatment and control of schistosomiasis in most developing countries. However, after long-term and large-scale administration of PZQ, drug-resistance has been a great concern. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies. In this study, we assessed the in vitro and in vivo antischistosomal effect of a PZQ derivative, named P96, with only a small modification of the cyclohexyl moiety, which was substituted by cyclopentyl group. It is this small modification that gives us a big surprise. In vitro, all the biological assessments, including viability reduction rate and morphological properties by scanning electron microscopy, demonstrate that P96 has superior anti-schistosomula activity compared to PZQ, and retains similar or even higher anti-adult S. japonicum activity to PZQ. The antischistosomal effect of P96 is dose-dependent. In vivo, P96 displays high efficacy against all developmental stages of S. japonicum, with significantly improved efficacy against young stage worms compared to PZQ. Furthermore, the quantitative detection results of specific circulatory SjR2 DNA prove that P96 at higher concentration of 300 mg/kg has similar activity to PZQ against adult schistosome at molecular level in rabbit sera with infection of schistosomiasis. In conclusion, P96 is a promising drug candidate for chemotherapy of schistosomiasis, potentially addressing the deficiency of PZQ, and might be promoted for use either alone or in combination with PZQ for treatment and control of schistosomiasis.
