    "Abstract": "Liver fibrosis is one of the histopathological characters during Echinococcus multilocularis infection. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a key event in the development of liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanism of HSC activation in the E. multilocularis infection-induced liver fibrosis remains largely unclear. Here, we reported that mmu-miR-342-3p was most dominantly expressed in HSCs and was upregulated in the HSCs in response to E. multilocularis infection. We further showed that mmu-miR-342-3p was able to bind to the 3\u2019 UTR of the Zbtb7a gene and regulated its expression. Moreover, mmu-miR-342-3p expression was negatively correlated with its target gene Zbtb7a in HSCs during E. multilocularis infection. Knockdown of mmu-miR-342-3p promoted the expression of Gfap in the activated HSCs in vitro. In the E. multilocularis-infected mice, knockdown of mmu-miR-342-3p suppressed the expression of \u03b1-Sma, Col1\u03b11, and TGF-\u03b2 but promoted the expression of Gfap. Therefore, mmu-miR-342-3p is a key regulator for activation of HSCs, and inhibiting mmu-miR-342-3p to suppressed Zbtb7a-mediated TGF-\u03b2 signaling in activated HSCs could be a novel strategy to treat liver fibrosis induced by E. multilocularis."
