Tungiasis, popularly called jiggers, is a painful and itchy skin infection. Jiggers is a poverty-driven plague and millions of people are at risk. Those infected may suffer mental and physical illness and stigmatization. Despite this, the disease is neglected by the scientific community, the health sector and policy makers. This study contributes to context-sensitive knowledge production necessary to design effective, multi-level interventions, and calls for more implementation research on control efforts and prevention of jiggersâ€™ infestation. Qualitative research on the experiences of jigger-affected communities is virtually nonexistent, yet important to identify effective health promotion measures.
