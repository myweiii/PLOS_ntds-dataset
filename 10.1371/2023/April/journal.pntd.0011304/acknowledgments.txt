We want to express our gratitude to all those who shared their painful experiences, to health workers, and staff and volunteers of Bungoma Red Cross who shared their knowledge about this stigmatized condition and public health problem. To Lucas Matias Jeno, Catherine Monika Schwinger and the research group for “intercultural studies, inclusion and social justice” at NLA University College, thank you for input and support.
