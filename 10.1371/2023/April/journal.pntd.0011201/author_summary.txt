Slow fungal clearance after antifungal therapy was observed in a few talaromycosis Marneffei (TSM) patients, leading to a significant prolongation of hospital day and increasing adverse drug reaction. The reasons of delayed clearance of Talaromyces Marneffei(T. marneffei) is still unclear. Although no standard cutoff value about minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the drug sensitivity results are still used to guide the clinical practice. Several studies had reported the MIC value of T. marneffei isolates against echinocandin, amphotericin B, and azoles in vitro in the past decade. Patients who infected with azole-resistant strains had a higher mortality risk than those infected with susceptible strains. To response to this phenomenon, the authors hypothesized that the susceptibility of T. marneffei strains to antifungal agents could affect its clearance in blood, and verifications were performed in the study.
