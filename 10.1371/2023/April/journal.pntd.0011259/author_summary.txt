Diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age in developing countries, and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) is a group of bacterial pathogens that cause a wide variety of intestinal diseases. To control the epidemic of DECs, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of prevalent strains in each region and propose appropriate treatment methods for them. This study reports detailed genomic analysis results of DEC-like strains isolated from infant diarrhea patients in Vietnam. The results suggested that many of the DECs prevalent in this country are uncommon types, and that Escherichia albertii, an emerging diarrheal pathogen, is the cause of diarrhea. Furthermore, comprehensive genome analysis revealed that these DECs are developing serious drug resistance. We believe that the results of this study will be the basis for improving treatment methods for patients with diarrhea and for tracking the evolution of this pathogenic group.
