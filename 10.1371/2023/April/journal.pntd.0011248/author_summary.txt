Some infections in pregnant women, known as congenital infections, can result in birth defects and harm in newborns. Adverse outcomes from these infections could include smaller than normal head sizes, other physical abnormalities, low birth weights, preterm births, developmental disabilities, stillbirths, and deaths. During the Zika virus epidemic in 2016, it was discovered that Zika virus is a congenital infection resulting in a global public health emergency. As part of our Zika study in Coatepeque, Guatemala in 2017â€“2018 we wanted to describe if pregnant women had other congenital infections, namely toxoplasmosis, other pathogens (i.e., syphilis, HIV), rubella, and cytomegalovirus. These are priority pathogens for maternal and child health and the Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance, and in this region, information is scarce about how common these congenital infections are (with exception of syphilis and HIV that are routinely screened for). Our study aims to provide data that can help inform public health authorities to implement prevention activities and establish other policies for public health practice.
