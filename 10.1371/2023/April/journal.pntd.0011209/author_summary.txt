Lassa fever, an epidemic-prone viral infection which frequently occurs in West African countries has a high mortality in pregnant women and their new-borns. Vaccination is an ideal method for preventing infection and while there are currently no licensed vaccines for Lassa fever, there have been marked innovations in Lassa vaccine development with some vaccines currently in early trials. Vaccine development requires background information on disease prevalence, incidence, and antibody kinetics. Our study sought to understand the kinetics of Lassa antibodies in pregnant women and their new-borns. This is the first study to evaluate the transfer of Lassa antibodies between the mother and child. We found that maternal antibody levels play an important role in determining how well antibodies are transferred from the mother to the child and may be influenced by the time when antibodies developed, with transfer of antibodies being less stable in those with recent infection. This suggest that for protection of both pregnant women and their neonates, it may be more appropriate to vaccinate women before they become pregnant, that is women of child-bearing age. While, the evidence is not conclusive, it is an important first step to understanding the kinetics of Lassa antibodies.
