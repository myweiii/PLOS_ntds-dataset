Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions. Most dengue cases are self-limiting and can be managed as outpatients without hospitalisation. Once diagnosed, patients are advised to return to the clinic daily for monitoring until they recover. However, some patients can deteriorate rapidly at home in between follow-up and fail to recognise the deterioration. Poor self-management often leads to a delay in seeking help and treatment; this significantly impacts morbidity and mortality. This research provides insight into the self-care practices, health-seeking behaviour and outpatient management of dengue from the perspectives of patients with dengue and primary care physicians who managed them.
