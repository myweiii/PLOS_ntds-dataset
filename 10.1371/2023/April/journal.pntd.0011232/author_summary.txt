Different etiologies of acute fever may have an unspecific clinical presentation, especially in the early days of onset. Urban centers in low-and middle-income countries share the reality of overloaded healthcare systems—especially during outbreaks–whose diagnostic capacity is limited. Even in reference centers, determining the etiology of acute fever may not be possible in a large proportion of patients. The incidence of pathogens other than Malaria and Arboviruses is scarcely reported in Latin America. In cities where Dengue Fever is highly endemic, management of acutely ill patients is jeopardized by the unfamiliarity of health professionals with the spectrum possible diagnosis. Therefore, learning about the distribution of different etiologies of fever in outpatient services can impact positively in patient care. Since specific laboratory tests are determinant for differentiating among etiological agents of fever, further improvement for point-of-care diagnosis, as well as their availability for the front-row assistance settings is essential. This study aims to describe the most common etiologies of Acute Febrile Illnesses observed over a 16-year period time inside one of the largest reference centers for tropical diseases research in Brazil, discussing the accuracy of presumptive clinical diagnosis and the challenges of laboratorial investigation.
