Lymphatic filariasis is a disease commonly characterized by urogenital swelling, or scrotal hydrocele and lymphedema, which affects nearly 50 million people worldwide as of 2018. It is caused by parasitic worms transmitted through mosquitos. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a ubiquitous enzyme involved in folate metabolism and provides building blocks for DNA synthesis. DHFR is an established pharmacological target in the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases through the use of DHFR specific inhibitors known as antifolates. Using recombinant DHFR from the parasitic worm W. bancrofti (Wb), we have recently shown that known antifolate compounds (i.e. methotrexate and others) potently inhibit this enzyme. However, the absence of structural information for WbDHFR has limited the investigation of in-depth structure-function relationships. We now report the first crystal structure of WbDHFR. Using in silico approaches, a series of known antifolates was docked into the active site of the enzyme to gain insights into their interactions with WbDHFR. Such data will facilitate the rational design of inhibitors specific for filarial DHFRs. The availability of such inhibitors will be crucial to establish DHFR as a valid target for the treatment of filariasis and will also help determine whether existing antifolates may be repurposed for treatment.
