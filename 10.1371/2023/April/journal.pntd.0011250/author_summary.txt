Onchocerciasis is a vector-borne parasitic infection associated with significant disabilities including permanent blindness. Onchocerca volvulus is endemic in 31 countries in Africa and Yemen where 220 million of people remain at risk. The control of onchocerciasis relies on annual or bi-annual mass administration of ivermectin. This approach has had a substantial impact on the burden of the disease and has led to interruption of the transmission of the infection in some areas. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many control programs, including MDA, were disrupted; mathematical models predicted that such disruption could affect the control efforts in some endemic settings (mainly in highly endemic areas prior to intervention and areas with short histories of MDA) and suggested mitigation measures such as increasing the frequency of MDA rounds. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of one missed round of ivermectin MDA on the burden of onchocerciasis and its endemicity in the Mbam valley in Cameroon. This study revealed that the decrease in parasitological indicators of the O. volvulus infection subsequent to the MDA disruption, was consistent with the mathematical predictions of ONCHOSIM model.
