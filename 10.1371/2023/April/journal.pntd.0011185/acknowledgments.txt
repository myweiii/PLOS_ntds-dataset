We remain indebted to NTD programme in Cameroon at National, Regional and District levels and the communities who supported all the activities. We are also thankful to the Centre for Research on Filariasis and other Tropical Diseases (CRFilMT) for performing sample collection and laboratory analysis. We thankfully recognise the generous contribution of the COUNTDOWN consortium/ Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the development of this protocol. The consortium provided insightful advice during the study’s implementation.
