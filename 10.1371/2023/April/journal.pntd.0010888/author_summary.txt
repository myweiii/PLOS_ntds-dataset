Leprosy is one of the oldest neurocutaneous diseases in the world. However, it has been neglected by the general population, doctors, and scientists. Transmitted by Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis, leprosy is met with stigma and prejudice. Some patients with leprosy (exposed individuals) keep their diagnosis a secret, fearing a negative impact on their social lives. The disease is characterized by white or red skin lesions associated with local numbness. Few studies have evaluated smell among exposed individuals, but they have not used the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), which is a validated psychophysical method. The present study found a high prevalence of olfactory impairment (91.7%) among exposed individuals, accompanied by low self-knowledge of the disorder (5.6%). It is thus important to assess the sense of smell in infected individuals, as this sensorineural assessment has not been performed as a routine for patients.
