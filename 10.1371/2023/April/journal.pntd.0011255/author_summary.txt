West Nile virus (WNV) is considered to be one of the neglected diseases in Malaysia as most vector-borne febrile illnesses in humans are predominantly diagnosed as dengue-like illnesses. Nevertheless, WNV might be an additional virus causing the mosquito-borne disease in Malaysia based on data from previous studies. Our group previously identified the presence of WNV RNA and antibodies in the migratory and resident birds, macaques, bats and swine. However, there is no current data that could confirm the presence of WNV in the vector responsible for transmission of WNV to a wide range of hosts. Using molecular analysis, WNV RNA was detected from Culex (Cx.) tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui, Cx. pseudovishnui, Cx. gelidus, Armigeres subalbatus, and Coquillettidia spp. The sequence of WNV RNA detected in mosquitoes was similar to the WNV lineage recovered from wild birds at the same location. These findings confirm the presence of an enzootic cycle of WNV in Malaysia and the risk for spill-over to humans and other vertebrates.
