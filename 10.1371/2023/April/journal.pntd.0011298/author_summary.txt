Infecting millions of people every year, cholera is a deadly water-borne disease that particularly plagues resource-limited settings. Communities facing humanitarian crises experience even greater challenges in preventing and responding to cholera outbreaks. A recent and increasingly common strategy in cholera outbreaks is case-area targeted interventions (CATIs). Rather than target an entire community in a blanketed approach, CATIs target the case household and surrounding neighbor households within a specified radius with WASH supplies and other activities. However, there is limited evidence about the challenges and effectiveness of this strategy, especially in fragile contexts. This study interviewed rapid response team members in Northeast Nigeria (Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe states) implementing CATI during a 2021 cholera outbreak. It identifies challenges that led teams to deviate from standard operating procedures and provides recommendations for future CATI implementation. This new knowledge may contribute to the development of evidence-based CATI protocols in future cholera outbreaks in humanitarian settings.
