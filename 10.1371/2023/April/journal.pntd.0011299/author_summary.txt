Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic has produced wide-spread disruption for many disease programmes there are also a range of other factors that continue to risk programme interruptions including other disease outbreaks (e.g. Ebola, cholera, yellow fever, and measles) and the potential for political instability. In this study we examine the impact of interruptions by external factors to the gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT, sleeping sickness) elimination programme of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country which has the highest global case burden. We use our previously fitted gHAT model to simulate how transmission dynamics might be impacted by disruption to medical interventions and (where relevant) vector control activities in 38 regions within Kwilu, Mai Ndombe and Kwango provinces. For each of the six interruption scenarios we use the model to forecast case numbers and disease burden as well as estimating the expected years and probabilities of elimination of transmission. This analysis provides invaluable insight into the impact that interruptions of any persuasion could have on burden, case reporting and time to achieve elimination of transmission of gHAT in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
