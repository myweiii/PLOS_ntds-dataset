Chagas disease is a global health problem in endemic and non-endemic regions due to migration. Early diagnosis of newborns to seropositive mothers is of utmost importance to Public Health, enabling prompt access to highly effective anti-parasitic treatment. For this, it is essential to develop rapid and sensitive methods at point-of-care (POC). The aim of this work was to estimate the analytical performance of the molecular amplification technique named Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as POC strategy to detect Trypanosoma cruzi in small volumes of blood collected in dried blood spots. The procedure was carried out in human blood samples spiked with T. cruzi strains on Whatman 903 or FTA commercial filter papers in comparison with fluid blood in heparin as anticoagulant. We used an ultra-rapid DNA extraction method, tested the LAMP reaction in two different heaters and visualized the results either by the naked eye or using fluorescence viewers. FTA cards showed excellent sensitivity and specificity; LAMP could be performed in a simple heater and results easily visualized with fluorescence viewers. The entire process entails handling basic laboratory devices that will enable POC diagnosis of congenital infection and other acute cases of Chagas disease such as those derived from oral outbreaks.
