This is a prospective observational study of human mpox disease, an emerging infectious disease that has traditionally occurred in Central and West Africa. There are certain differential characteristics when compared to other pox diseases. We describe the presenting symptoms and signs of human mpox disease, laboratory findings and make recommendations for the medical treatment of patients with mpox disease. The classic MPX rash was seen in 99.5% of patients. Unlike other pox diseases, enlarged lymph nodes were observed in 98.6% of patients. The pathologic findings of MPXV infected placenta and fetus are presented as well.
