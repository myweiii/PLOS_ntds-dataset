We dedicate this manuscript to the memory of Nelson Ferreira Fé, a talented entomologist, taxonomist, and our friend, who contributed immensely to vector-borne disease research in the Brazilian Amazon. We wish to acknowledge Ramon Linhares and Layne Borges (FMT-HVD) for assistance with sample processing; Raimundo Coelho and Aleksey Lima (FMT-HVD) for driving and logistics, and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia (INPA) for permission to use the Adolpho Ducke Reserve to collect samples for this study.
