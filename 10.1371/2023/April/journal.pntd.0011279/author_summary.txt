In 2020, MARV was first detected in fruit bats in Sierra Leone (West Africa). One year later, first outbreak of MARV in West Africa was registered in the neighboring Guinea after a man’s death in the Temessadou M’bokét village. The source of the outbreak has not been identified. It is known, that the reservoir animal of MARV is the cave-dwelling bat Rousettus aegyptiacus, and typically, MARV disease outbreaks emerge after a visit of the index patient to a cave or mine.
In our work, we studied bats in the vicinity of this village for the presence of the MARV. A cave hosting a colony of R. aegyptiacus was found close to the Temessadou M’bokét village (~4.5 km). Sampling and PCR screening of the bats from the colony identified two MARV-positive bats. The cave is inaccessible to humans; therefore, the index patient could not have been infected upon visit. We assume that the patient was infected outside the cave after direct or indirect contact with an infected bat of the same colony. These results provide the basis for preventive measures against new MARV outbreaks in Guinea.
