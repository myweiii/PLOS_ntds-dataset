Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the most common communicable diseases in crisis settings, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Non-comparable as well as little aetiological data from refugee camps and surveillance, make it difficult to compare the prevalence of ARI disease between crisis and non-crisis contexts. In the world’s largest refugee settlement situated in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, very little is known about the etiology of ARIs. To our best knowledge, this is the first case-control prospective study to evaluate the level of involvement of each etiological agent in the onset of LARI etiology, and the association between respiratory viral infections and invasive pneumococcal infections, S. pneumoniae serotype distribution, antimicrobial resistance pattern both in case and control group. Our study showed that ≤5 years age group was the most vulnerable, having the highest number of bacteria as well as viruses both in the case and control group. S. pneumoniae was the predominant bacteria, whereas, among the viruses ADV, IFVs, and RSV were predominant. Semi-quantitative bacterial as well as viral load was found higher in the case group. Positive correlation between viruses and other pathogens was higher in cases of RSV than in the control group. However, single as well as co-infection between viruses were significantly high among the ARI case while for bacteria it was comparable between the case and control group. ARI case enrollment peaked in September and October in the FDMN camps in Bangladesh.
