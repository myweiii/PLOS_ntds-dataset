Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar caused by the digenetic parasite Leishmania donovani is a fatal form of leishmaniasis, unless treated. In South Asia, approximately 10â€“20% of apparently cured cases of VL develop a dermal sequela termed post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). It presents with macular or papulonodular lesions that harbour Leishmania parasites. Importantly, these cases of PKDL in addition to asymptomatic and relapsed VL cases serve as mobile disease reservoirs and sustain disease transmission. In macular PKDL, that presently comprise over 50% of cases, the diagnosis is particularly challenging as parasites are often not detectable by microscopy. Accordingly, development of strategies for molecular diagnosis is one of the major foci of the ongoing leishmaniasis elimination programme targeted for 2023, that aims to decrease the burden to <1/10,000 cases of VL at the block/zilla level. Serological tests have limited applicability when it is necessary to distinguish present from past infection of VL, and in cases of PKDL when the positivity maybe due to a past history of VL. An excellent option is the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) but limitations for its wider field applicability include the high cost, technical expertise and time factor. Accordingly, an urgent need exists for availability of field applicable molecular tests. The RPA tested in this study could well be the desired game-changer as it provided accurate diagnosis of VL and PKDL, can be performed in a primary health centre, and demonstrated the potential to be a monitoring tool for parasite load after treatment, that eventually can accelerate achieving the end-goal of elimination of leishmaniasis.
