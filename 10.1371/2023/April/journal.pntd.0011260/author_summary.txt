Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes that threatens more than half of the worldâ€™s population. This re-emerging disease predominates in tropical areas such as Reunion Island, but is also expanding in formerly temperate regions. Some patients with dengue may have early signs (warning signs) of life-threatening complications (dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome) and require hospitalization, but only a minority of patients will progress to severe dengue. Identification of patients at risk is crucial to deliver optimal treatment without saturating intensive care units during epidemic periods. To this end, we followed 163 hospitalized patients with dengue during the 2019 epidemic in Reunion Island. Nearly a quarter of the patients had a severe form of the disease. The presence of cardiovascular disease, Western European origin, and delay in diagnostic and management were the main risk factors. This observation underlines the importance of an efficient detection of vulnerable populations and of an early management based on rehydration to prevent the occurrence of severe dengue in Reunion Island.
