Many factors drive dengue circulation and seasonal patterns, such as environmental factors, including the urban landscape, which can provide suitable sites for the emergence and proliferation of Aedes aegypti. We aim to test if some places of interest identified by the Ministry of Health in Brazil affect dengue case distribution and the risk differently. We considered the Strategic Points (SPs) and Special Buildings (SBs) as reported by public health authorities. These are properties that can favor the proliferation of mosquitoes and favor human exposure to the dengue virus. We focused on the municipality of Campinas from 2013 to 2016. We assessed the distribution of dengue cases around these properties and the existence of a gradient in risk with increasing distance from these places using Stone’s test. We found a correlation between the distance from these properties and dengue cases occurrences (for most sources investigated). Higher risk was always closer to the SPs and SBs, and the risk decreased as distance from these sources increased. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of public agents’ survey work and the maintenance and improvement of the inspections already conducted in SPs/SBs properties.
