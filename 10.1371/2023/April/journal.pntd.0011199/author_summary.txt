Dairy production in Tanzania constitutes traditional cattle meat-milk, improved smallholder dairy and commercial dairy farms. Despite the slow growth of the sector, smallholder dairy farming system remained a crucial for income generation and employment for thousands of families. This is more evident in the northern and southern highland of Tanzania where over 70% improved dairy cattle and milk production are core economic activities. Although the proportion of improved dairy cattle is relatively small compared to indigenous cattle, improved dairy sector contributes to 30% of milk produced in Tanzania. Constrains of leptospirosis in dairy, particularly of serovar Hardjo, remain a problem of its ability to cause abortion and reduce milk production in many farms worldwide. For many years epidemiological surveillance of leptospirosis in Tanzanian dairy cattle population is limited. This study provides a current status of seroprevalence and driven risk factors of leptospirosis occurrence in smallholder dairy cattle population from six regions of Tanzania as well as mapping hotspot areas at the district administrative level.
