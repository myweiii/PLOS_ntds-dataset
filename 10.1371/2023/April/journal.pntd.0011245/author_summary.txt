In recent years, the incidence rate of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has declined in most area of China, although the acceleration of urbanization caused increasingly complicated interactions among anthropogenic activities, environmental factors, and host animals during the past decades. However, there were still some typical regions with serious HFRS epidemics in this country like the Weihe Basin in Shaanxi Province, in which more efforts should be paid for identifying the potential influencing factors and their driving mechanisms. Our study employed the MaxEnt modeling to reveal the spatio-temporal variations in the influencing factors on the epidemics of this disease from 2005 to 2020 in the Weihe Basin. We found that the landscape played controlling effect in this area while land use, vegetation and population in the area interacted with each other and drove the change of HFRS epidemic. The underling influencing factors and the stimulation of HFRS epidemic would provide detailed information for targeted strategy formulation, and the also provide reference for similar studies.
