Goat production and meat consumption are growing in Cambodia. Smallholders often keep goats in a housing area within their households, increasing contact between animals and humans and, thereby, the risk for zoonotic disease transmission. This study collected 540 goat samples applying the two-stage survey method, where the communes were the sampling frame and villages were clustered and tested for antibodies against Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Foot and mouth disease virus non-structural protein (FMDV NSP), and Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The overall apparent seroprevalence of Brucella, C. burnetii, FMDV NSP and PPRV were 0.4%,7.2%, 53.3% and 0.9% (n = 540), respectively. The only two brucella-positive samples were from Kampot and Tboung Khmum provinces. Moreover, Kandal province (22.2%, N = 90) and Dei Edth commune (36.7%, N = 30) had the highest C. burnetii seroprevalence compared to the others. Although seroprevalence of Brucella spp. detected in our study was low, while C. burnetii seroprevalence in some studied areas was relatively high, and the impacts of both zoonoses on animal and human health remain unknown. Seroprevalence of FMDV NSF was also high and widely distributed. Thus, future investigations targeting high-risk areas would be recommended to understand better the disease epidemiologies and their impacts on human and animal health.
