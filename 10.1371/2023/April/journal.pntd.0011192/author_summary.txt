Although Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) has circulated in Asia and the western Pacific during the past 30 years, little is known regarding its evolution, geographical distribution, and epidemiology, especially the recent years. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using all full open reading frame JEV sequences assembled thus far, including 113 viral sequences sampled from eight countries during the past 42 years. We revealed spatiotemporal differences in spread among JEV GI subclades; identified amino acid markers for different clades; made an in-depth study on the evolution of GIb, described the geographical distribution of the recent active GIb clade 2 and identified its emerging variant.
