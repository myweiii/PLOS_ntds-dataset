Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a complex, neglected parasitic zoonosis. Tools and expertise in the diagnosis of CE are not widely available and the development of accurate and easily implementable diagnostic assays for CE has been highlighted as a priority also by the WHO. Antigen discovery for the immunodiagnosis of CE has relied so far on classical methods, which are impractical and poorly sensitive. Here, starting from the Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto genome, we aimed to identify antigenic peptides having a potential for CE diagnosis based on a multiple-criteria strategy involving the bioinformatics selection of proteins, followed by screening by peptide microarray and validation by ELISA, using a panel of well-characterized sera from patients with hepatic CE in all development stages, and from clinically relevant controls. This methodology has virtually never been applied in the field of CE. Importantly, the developed database can be used to identify other E. granulosus s.s. antigenic candidates.
