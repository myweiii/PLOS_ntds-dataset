At present, screening for schistosomiasis among long-term migrants to non-endemic countries is relatively uncommon, despite growing evidence of the burden to healthcare systems associated with chronic disease. In this article we estimate the costs of systematically screening an exposed population for schistosomiasis infection. Though our results support the implementation of such a program from a cost perspective, they are hampered by important gaps in our ability to estimate costs, particularly with regard to the efficacy of treatment of chronic Schistosoma infection in adults. Therefore the implementation of any screening program should be aligned with further research regarding these costs. Screening programs would also benefit from the development of in-situ diagnostic tests and an appropriate Point-of-Care strategy.
