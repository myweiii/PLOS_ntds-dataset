Cat fleas cause discomfort through their bites, and can transmit numerous diseases to animals and humans. Traditionally, fleas have been reared for research on live animals, but this process requires animal handling permits, inflicts discomfort on animals, and is costly. Artificial feeding methods that warm blood and offer it through a membrane have been used but fleas often take small amount of blood and produce fewer eggs than those with rearing on live hosts. To maximize blood consumption and egg production, we offered fleas blood from four hosts to determine the most suitable blood for flea rearing. We also tested the effects of the addition of compounds that increase blood consumption (phagostimulants). Fleas fed dog blood consumed the most blood, followed by fleas fed on cow, cat, or human blood. Addition of phagostimulants did not enhance blood consumption. Fleas fed dog blood produced 129.5 eggs, whereas females on cat, human, and cow blood produced 97.2, 83.0, and 70.7 eggs, respectively. The observed results in dog blood indicate an improvement toward the production of cat fleas in the laboratory without feeding on live animals. This system will enable more humane and convenient production of this pest for scientific research.
