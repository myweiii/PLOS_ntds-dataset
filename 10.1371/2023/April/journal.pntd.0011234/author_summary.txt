Mosquitoes develop in the presence of diverse bacterial communities that shape their ability to transmit disease-causing pathogens. However, our current understanding of mosquito-microbiota interactions is largely based on studies of individuals colonized by low-diversity communities of bacteria that are not commonly associated with mosquitoes in the laboratory or field. In this study, we developed an approach to isolate and cryopreserve microbiota from mosquito larval rearing environments in the lab and field. We then demonstrated the successful use of this approach to produce experimental microcosms colonized by standardized microbial communities. Our results are of critical significance to the field of vector biology because they will directly (i) facilitate the study of mosquito traits of interest (e.g., pathogen susceptibility) in the absence of confounding effects of microbiota variation, and (ii) enable reproducible intra- and inter-laboratory studies of mosquito-microbiota interactions to identify microbial targets for disease control. Our results are also of broad interest to researchers in the fields of microbial ecology and host-microbe interactions because they demonstrate how tools commonly used to study microbiota assembly and function in mammals can be leveraged in other systems.
