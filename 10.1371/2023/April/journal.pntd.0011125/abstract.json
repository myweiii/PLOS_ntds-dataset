    "Background": "While surgical simulation is regularly used in surgical training in high-income country settings, it is uncommon in low- and middle-income countries, particularly for surgical training that primarily occurs in rural areas. We designed and evaluated a novel surgical simulator for improving trachomatous trichiasis (TT) surgery training, given that trichiasis is mostly found among the poorest individuals in rural areas.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "TT surgery programs were invited to incorporate surgical simulation with a new, high fidelity, low-cost simulator into their training. Trainees completed standard TT-surgery training following World Health Organization guidelines. A subset of trainees received three hours of supplemental training with the simulator between classroom and live-surgery training. We recorded the time required to complete each surgery and the number of times the trainer intervened to correct surgical steps. Participants completed questionnaires regarding their perceptions. We also assessed trainer and trainee perceptions of surgical simulation training as part of trichiasis surgery training.",
    "Conclusions": "A single high-fidelity surgical simulation session can significantly improve critical aspects of initial TT surgeries."
