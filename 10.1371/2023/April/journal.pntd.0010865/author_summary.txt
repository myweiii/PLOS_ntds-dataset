Four genera of fungi cause dermatophytosis, the most common and highly contagious infectious skin disease. Distinguishing dermatophyte species is crucial since ecological origin (geophilic, zoophilic or anthropophilic) provides clues about the source of infection, contributing to avoid reinfection and to the establishment of prevention measures. Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere, located in the most visited state of Brazil. This retrospective study investigated epidemiological and laboratorial aspects of dermatophytosis in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, by using spatiotemporal analysis. More than half of all individuals were infected by one or more dermatophytes. Microsporum canis and Nannizzia gypsea were more frequently isolated in the age group between 40 and 60 years old while T. rubrum predominates among younger patients. All species presented homogeneous distribution while T. tonsurans appears to be restricted to Rio de Janeiro capital and Epydermophyton floccosum to the municipality of Macaé. Significant spatiotemporal clusters on dermatophytosis cases were detected in distinct municipalities (p-value ≤ 0.05). Dermatophytosis spatiotemporal distinct distribution after two major international events in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2014 Football World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games), highlights the pressing need for specific measures of prevention and controlling.
