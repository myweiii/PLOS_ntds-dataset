    "Abstract": "Trichophyton, Microsporum, Nannizzia and Epidermophyton genera cause dermatophytosis, the most common and highly contagious infectious skin disease. Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere, located in the most visited state of Brazil. This retrospective study investigated epidemiological and laboratorial aspects of dermatophytosis in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, by using spatiotemporal analysis. More than half of all individuals were infected by one or more dermatophytes. A variation between 18 and 106 years-old of the studied population was verified, and women more frequently affected. Patients were more frequently infected by Trichophyton spp., most of them T. rubrum, followed by T. mentagrophytes. M. canis and N. gypsea were more frequently isolated in the age group between 40 and 60 years old, while T. rubrum predominates among younger patients. All species presented homogeneous distribution while T. tonsurans appears to be restricted to the Rio de Janeiro capital and E. floccosum to the municipality of Maca\u00e9 (190 Km apart from RJ). Rio de Janeiro state presented spatial clusters of dermatophytosis with high density in Guanabara Bay (E. floccosum, M. canis, N. gypsea, T. tonsurans) and Niter\u00f3i (T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes) but low density in Maca\u00e9 (E. floccosum). Significant spatiotemporal clusters on dermatophytosis cases were detected in distinct municipalities (p-value \u2264 0.05). The Vulnerability Index (r = 0.293) and Demographic Density (r = 0.652) distributed according to neighborhoods in Niter\u00f3i were direct related with dermatophytosis cases whereas Income (r = -0.306) was inversely correlated (p-value \u2264 0.05). The dermatophytosis spatiotemporal distinct distribution after two major international events in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, highlight the pressing need for specific measures of its prevention and controlling. This is particularly relevant in touristic tropical localities which must consider both socio-economical and traveler\u2019s medicine variables."
