Snakebite envenoming is a public health concern in the Amazon region. It represents an acute medical emergency needing early care such as stroke, severe trauma, myocardial infarction, etc. Antivenoms are the most effective treatment of snakebite envenomings. They are part of the WHO List of essential medicines and should be available in any primary health care where snakebite victims are managed. In this context, less than 6 hours delay between the snakebite and the antivenom administration is needed for a maximal chance to prevent and reverse most of the toxic effects of the snake venom.
