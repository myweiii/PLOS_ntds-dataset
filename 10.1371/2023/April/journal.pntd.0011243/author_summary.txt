High genomic DNA load is a marker for the virulence of the pathogen and is associated with disease severity in bacterial infectious diseases. Recent studies have indicated that the non-surviving patients with scrub typhus had a significantly higher bacterial load than the surviving patients, and that duration of illness, presence of eschar, and hepatic enzyme levels were positively correlated with the O. tsutsugamushi DNA load in patient from northeast Thailand and South Korea. However, the severity and fatality of scrub typhus showed largely geographic variability. To further analyze the association of genomic DNA load with severity in surviving patients, the O. tsutsugamushi genomic load in blood samples of patients with scrub typhus in Hainan, China was evaluated. The results indicated that O. tsutsugamushi DNA load was associated with the genotypes, ethnic group of the patients, the highest body temperature recorded during fever onset and the total bilirubin (TBil) in the blood. However, no significant difference in O. tsutsugamushi DNA load was found between mild, moderate, and severe patient groups, nor between groups of patients with or without eschar. This research contributes to a better overall understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of O. tsutsugamushi.
