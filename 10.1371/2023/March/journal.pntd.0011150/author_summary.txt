Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease usually transmitted by sandfly bites, but also by placental transmission, sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, and direct inoculation into the skin. Clinical manifestations range from self-limited cutaneous disease to life-threatening visceral infection. Healthcare workers who come into contact with patients and/or their body fluids are at risk for occupational infection. The authors present the case of a healthcare provider who suffered an accidental autoinoculation with a needle contaminated with Leishmania organisms. When encountering cutaneous leishmaniasis, physicians should remember that leishmaniasis can also be transmitted by direct inoculation in a clinical setting and take contact and needle precautions. In the event of an accidental puncture, knowledge of the morphology and natural history of cutaneous leishmaniasis may be critical for diagnosis and thus prompt treatment. Therefore, education on the principles and practices to avoid transmission of infectious diseases should begin during training.
