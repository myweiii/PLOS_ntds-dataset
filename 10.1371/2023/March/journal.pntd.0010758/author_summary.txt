Current machine learning approaches are mostly designed for decision support systems that used for predicting severity of dengue and forecasting of dengue cases. The few studies to predict plasma leakage rely on traditional statistical approach with a priori predictors. To our knowledge, no study used machine learning to predict plasma leakage in suspected dengue patients. This is the first study to develop a machine learning model to identify predictors that detect plasma leakage in the early stages of dengue infection. In addition, this study placed focus on a limited resource setting enabling decision support systems to be utilised in the low- to middle-income country of Sri Lanka. The study identified five accessible predictors as inputs to the model to aid the decision making for hospital admission for suspected cases of dengue. Lastly, the multi-metric assessments, model fairness and Shapley additive explanations push the agenda for model transparency and interpretability. Our machine learning approach demonstrated reasonable performance and has the potential to identify patients who are likely to develop plasma leakage for close monitoring to prevent severe consequences.
