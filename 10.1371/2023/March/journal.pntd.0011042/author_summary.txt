Taenia solium is a tapeworm that causes three diseases, taeniosis in humans and cysticercosis in humans and pigs. Neurocysticercosis, which occurs when the central nervous system is involved has been associated with up to 57% of epilepsy cases in subâ€“Saharan Africa. Diagnosing neurocysticercosis among people with epilepsy is vital to prevent further morbidity and mortality from the disease as well as to reduce the negative socio-cultural beliefs associated with epilepsy. Within Eastern and Southern Africa, there are many countries in which information on the presence of human taeniosis, cysticercosis and neurocysticercosis seems scarce. This systematic review aimed to describe the current information available and gaps in the epidemiology of human T. solium infections in Eastern and Southern Africa. We found that Information on either taeniosis, cysticercosis or NCC was available only for 16 of 27 countries within the region. We also found that most of the studies on T. solium taeniosis, cysticercosis and neurocysticercosis within the region have been done in Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia. Understanding the epidemiology of T. solium infections is essential for monitoring, prevention and control of the disease complex in a One Health approach.
