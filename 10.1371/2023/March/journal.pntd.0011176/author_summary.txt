Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are highly prevalent neglected tropical diseases globally. Current WHO recommendations for the control of STH focus on treating children, women of childbearing age, and others with occupations at high risk for STH infections such as agriculture. Evidence from mathematical models suggests that it may be possible to interrupt STH transmission by treating everyone in the community through community-wide mass drug administration (cMDA). This multi-methods study was conducted with government stakeholders in three Indian states, Goa, Sikkim, and Odisha, to assess their readiness for transitioning to a cMDA program for STH. Three data collection methods, organizational readiness surveys, key informant interviews, and program mapping were used in this study. The results showed a high-level of health system readiness in all the three states with respect to policy environment, leadership structure, material resources, technical capacity, and community infrastructure to implement a cMDA program. Stakeholders reported the potential for possible integration of cMDA with other programs such as for lymphatic filariasis, maternal and child health, and non-communicable diseases provided the human and financial resources are strengthened, and local leaders and community groups are engaged in the program. In-migration was a perceived challenge for estimating drug requirement and preventing possible stockouts.
