Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. While predominantly transmitted by sandflies, cases of VL transmitted through blood transfusion have been reported, particularly in immunocompromised recipients. Whereas Leishmania parasites have been found in blood donors in VL endemic areas across the globe, this has never been studied in East-Africa. We studied how common Leishmania infections occur in blood donors presenting at two blood bank sites (Metema and Gondar) in northwest Ethiopia. Metema is located in a VL-endemic area; Gondar has historically been considered VL non-endemic but as an outbreak of VL has occurred around Gondar, it was defined as previously VL non-endemic. Blood samples were tested for the presence of the parasite (DNA) or antibodies against the parasite. Asymptomatic infection was defined as positivity on any of these tests in a healthy person. A total of 426 voluntary blood donors were included, predominantly young men living in urban areas. DNA or antibodies against Leishmania was detected in 15.0% in Metema and 4.2% in Gondar. There were six individuals with two positive tests: one positive on rK39 and PCR and five positive on rK39 and ELISA. The prevalence of asymptomatic infection was higher in Metema and males but was not associated with age, a history of VL amongst family members or living in a rural area. Antibodies against Leishmania and parasite DNA was detected in a substantial number of blood donors. Future research should be directed at better defining the risk to recipients, including parasite viability studies and longitudinal studies amongst recipients.
