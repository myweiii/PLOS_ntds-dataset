Cutaneous leishmaniasis is commonly referred to as a neglected tropical disease. Presented with many species, the ones existing in Peru are rarely deadly, but it can cause chronic non-healing ulcers and scarring that can lead to contractures and social stigma. Due to the toxicity of the treatments for this disease, most ministries of health require a diagnosis prior to its initiation. Unfortunately, diagnosis can be quite difficult, as the gold standard of microscopy requires highly trained personnel. As the use of microscopy, the rapid, point-of-care diagnostic device CL Detect has been a viable option for Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis; however, in the New World the FDA-cleared device has low sensitivity. In this study, three simple changes (sample collection by the standard method of scraping using a lancet, increased extraction time, and increased sample volume) to the instructions were implemented and showed a similar diagnostic sensitivity to microscopy for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Peru.
