Tick-borne encephalitis is a serious and frequently deadly infectious disease. It is caused by a virus of the same name with genome composed of single-stranded RNA. The known genomes of this virus fall into three large regional groups: Europe, Siberia, or the Russian Far East. These groups have originated from a common ancestor several hundred or thousand years ago and were assumed to have evolved independently since then. This study shows that a previously described group of viruses obtained in the vicinity of Lake Baikal in Russia have a mosaic genome: some parts of it are more closely related to those of the Siberian group, while others, to the Far Eastern group. Such a pattern probably arose through recombination–a process during which a cell infected with two distinct viruses produces “hybrid” viral progeny carrying genetic material from both parents. While recombination is frequent in other RNA viruses, it has not been previously described for the tick-borne encephalitis virus. These findings show that mixture of genetic information from distinct sources can contribute to genetic diversity of this group of viruses, and potentially accelerate their adaptation.
