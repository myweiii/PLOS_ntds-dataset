    "Abstract": "Neglected tropical diseases are a global public health problem. Although Brazil is largely responsible for their occurrence in Latin America, research funding on the subject does not meet the population\u2019s health needs. The present study analyzed the evolution of research funding for neglected tropical diseases by the Ministry of Health and its partners in Brazil, from 2004 to 2020. This is a retrospective study of data from investigations registered on Health Research (Pesquisa Sa\u00fade in Portuguese), a public repository for research funded by the Ministry of Health\u2019s Department of Science and Technology. The temporal trend of funding and the influence of federal government changes on funding were analyzed using Prais-Winster generalized linear regression. From 2004 to 2020, 1,158 studies were financed (purchasing power parity (PPP$) 230.9 million), with most funding aimed at biomedical research (81.6%) and topics involving dengue, leishmaniasis and tuberculosis (60.2%). Funding was stationary (annual percent change of -5.7%; 95%CI -54.0 to 45.0) and influenced by changes to the federal government. Research funding was lacking for chikungunya, Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, malaria and taeniasis/cysticercosis, diseases with a high prevalence, burden or mortality rates in Brazil. Although the Ministry of Health had several budgetary partners, it was the main funder, with 69.8% of investments. The study revealed that research funding for neglected tropical diseases has stagnated over the years and that diseases with a high prevalence, burden and mortality rate receive little funding. These findings demonstrate the need to strengthen the health research system by providing sustainable funding for research on neglected tropical diseases that is consistent with the population\u2019s health needs."
