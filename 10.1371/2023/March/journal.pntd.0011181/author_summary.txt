Growth failure can begin in utero and worsen during early infancy; environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) has been hypothesized as an important causal factor. EED is an acquired, subclinical condition of the small intestine associated with chronic exposure to an unhygienic environment where enteric pathogens persist. Histologic features include mucosal inflammation, villous blunting, altered barrier integrity, and reduced intestinal absorptive capacity. Despite EED’s purported link to poor health and nutrition outcomes in young children in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), our knowledge of EED is relatively limited and is hindered by the lack of validated biomarkers across EED’s various domains. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between biomarkers of EED, including ones in the 11-plex Micronutrient and EED Assessment Tool (MEEDAT), and growth and development in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) Tanzanian infants. Overall, we found that certain anti-flagellin and anti-LPS Igs assessed at 6 weeks and 6 months were significantly associated with reduced linear growth at 12 months. EED biomarkers in MEEDAT were significantly associated with subsequent developmental, but not growth, outcomes.
