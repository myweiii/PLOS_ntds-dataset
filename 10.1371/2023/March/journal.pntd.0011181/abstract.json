    "Background": "Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) may contribute to poor growth and development in young children. While validated EED biomarkers are currently lacking, multiplex assays are able to capture multiple domains of the condition. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the relationship between biomarkers of EED and subsequent growth and development among Tanzanian HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants.",
    "Methodology": "We enrolled 467 infants of mothers living with HIV who had participated in a trial of vitamin D3 supplementation during pregnancy. Infant serum samples collected at 6 weeks (n = 365) and 6 months (n = 266) were analyzed for anti-flagellin and anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) IgA and IgG via ELISA as well as the 11-plex Micronutrient and EED Assessment Tool (MEEDAT), which incorporates two biomarkers of EED [intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14)]. Outcomes were 12-month growth [length-for-age z-score (LAZ), weight-for-length z-score (WLZ), and weight-for-age z-score (WAZ)] and development [Caregiver Reported Early Development Instruments (CREDI) z-scores] and were assessed using linear regression.",
    "Findings": "In primary analyses, higher quartiles of 6-month anti-LPS IgG concentrations were significantly associated with lower LAZ at 12 months (ptrend = 0.040). In secondary analyses, higher log2-transformed 6-week anti-flagellin IgA and 6-month anti-LPS IgA concentrations were significantly associated with lower LAZ at 12 months. No associations were observed between I-FABP or sCD14 and infant growth. However, higher log2-transformed 6-week sCD14 concentrations were significantly associated with lower overall CREDI z-scores, while higher log2-transformed 6-month I-FABP concentrations were significantly associated with higher overall CREDI z-scores.",
    "Conclusions": "Unlike anti-flagellin and anti-LPS Igs, MEEDAT\u2019s biomarkers of EED (I-FABP and sCD14) were not associated with subsequent linear growth among HEU infants in Tanzania. The relationship between EED and infant development warrants further study."
