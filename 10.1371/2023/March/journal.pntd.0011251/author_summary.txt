Mass drug administration (MDA) using ivermectin is considered the main intervention for controlling the transmission of onchocerciasis. The program involves administering the drug to an entire target population irrespective of infection status or symptom. In most instances, administration of ivermectin is done annually in areas with low transmission and biannually in high transmission settings. However, when a proportion of the population fails to participate in an MDA program, a potential reservoir for the parasite is left untreated, opening the door to recrudescence of microfilaremia and reducing the probability of successful elimination of the disease. Thus, community participation is considered vital in addressing the gaps in MDA coverage and uptake. There is a link between participation and acceptability of a health intervention. For instance, once communities deem MDA to be acceptable, they are more likely to be motivated to participate in the intervention. Measures of acceptability provide a clearer understanding of factors that might be associated with compliance with a heath intervention. This study, therefore, assesses factors influencing community acceptability of MDA for the elimination of onchocerciasis. The findings provide useful information that could inform policy decisions on strategies to address MDA implementation gaps.
