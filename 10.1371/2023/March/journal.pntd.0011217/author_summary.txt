Cryptosporidium parvum is an important zoonotic parasite, for which fully effective treatments are unavailable. Anti-cryptosporidial drug discovery faces many challenges and technical difficulties. One obstacle is the lack of tools to assess whether the killing of C. parvum by an inhibitor is attributed to the action on the parasite or on host cells. To address this question, we developed an MDR1-transgenic host cell line that allowed rapid development of drug resistance by applying continuous drug pressure. By analyzing the antiparasitic activity and cytotoxicity between wild-type and drug-resistant host cells, we verified that nitazoxanide (the only FDA-approved drug for treating cryptosporidiosis) and paclitaxel (anti-cryptosporidial lead) killed the parasite by acting fully on the parasite, whereas mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, vincristine and ivermectin killed the parasite by acting on both the parasite and host cells. We also developed algorithms to differentiate the percent contributions of actions on the parasite and host cell targets to the observed anti-cryptosporidial activity. In summary, we developed novel in vitro and mathematical models for evaluating the on-target effects of anti-cryptosporidial drugs. The models are also applicable to evaluate/quantify the drug actions on other epicellular pathogens.
