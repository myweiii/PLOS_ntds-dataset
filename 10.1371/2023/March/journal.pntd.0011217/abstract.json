    "Abstract": "Cryptosporidium parvum is a globally distributed zoonotic protozoan parasite that causes moderate to severe, sometime deadly, watery diarrhea in humans and animals, for which fully effective treatments are yet unavailable. In studying the mechanism of action of drugs against intracellular pathogens, it is important to validate whether the observed anti-infective activity is attributed to the drug action on the pathogen or host target. For the epicellular parasite Cryptosporidium, we have previously developed a concept that the host cells with significantly increased drug tolerance by transient overexpression of the multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1) could be utilized to evaluate whether and how much the observed anti-cryptosporidial activity of an inhibitor was attributed to the inhibitor\u2019s action on the parasite target. However, the transient transfection model was only applicable to evaluating native MDR1 substrates. Here we report an advanced model using stable MDR1-transgenic HCT-8 cells that allows rapid development of novel resistance to non-MDR1 substrates by multiple rounds of drug selection. Using the new model, we successfully validated that nitazoxanide, a non-MDR1 substrate and the only FDA-approved drug to treat human cryptosporidiosis, killed C. parvum by fully (100%) acting on the parasite target. We also confirmed that paclitaxel acted fully on the parasite target, while several other inhibitors including mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, vincristine and ivermectin acted partially on the parasite targets. Additionally, we developed mathematical models to quantify the proportional contribution of the on-parasite-target effect to the observed anti-cryptosporidial activity and to evaluate the relationships between several in vitro parameters, including antiparasitic efficacy (ECi), cytotoxicity (TCi), selectivity index (SI) and Hill slope (h). Owning to the promiscuity of the MDR1 efflux pump, the MDR1-transgenic host cell model could be applied to assess the on-parasite-target effects of newly identified hits/leads, either substrates or non-substrates of MDR1, against Cryptosporidium or other epicellular pathogens."
