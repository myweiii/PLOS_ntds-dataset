Severe febrile illnesses, including severe malaria and bacterial bloodstream infections, are a major cause of under-five mortality. To save lives, on-time hospital referral is crucial to treat severe febrile illness appropriately as soon as possible. In a district hospital in DR Congo, we observed that one third of children with severe febrile illness had a long health itinerary, which meant that they arrived at the hospital >3 days after fever onset. Long health itinerary was most frequent (50.8%) in children with bloodstream infection. In-hospital death was more frequent in children with bloodstream infection (22.8%) than in children with severe malaria (2.6%). In-hospital death mostly occurred early after hospital arrival (admission day 1â€“2) and having a long health itinerary was associated with death. Finally, we observed that consulting multiple prehospital healthcare providers and prehospital injections & overnight stays were associated with long health itinerary and in-hospital death. We conclude that children with severe febrile illness often arrived late at the hospital, which might contribute to high case fatality, particularly for children with bloodstream infection. Future research and interventions should focus on improved danger sign recognition and earlier referral of children with bloodstream infections by (in)formal frontline healthcare workers.
