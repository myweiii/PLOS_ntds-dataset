Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection mostly in warm and tropical regions, which has been listed as one of the top ten global health threats by the WHO. Among neglected tropical diseases, the mortality of dengue is on the rise. Severe dengue (typically manifested by bleeding, organ dysfunction, and plasma leakage) has become a leading cause of hospitalization for children and adults. There is a higher risk of death if severe dengue cases are not appropriately managed. Therefore, finding biomarkers that can reliably predict the development of severe dengue in symptomatic individuals is one of the main focuses of current research efforts. We found that dyspnoea, plasma leakage, and hemorrhage were the independent risk factors of severe dengue. The predictive probability of occurrence of severe dengue achieved 92.9% among people aged â‰¤ 12.5 years with dyspnoea and plasma leakage. Establishing an early warning system for severe dengue based on these factors is essential for triaging in endemic areas. The findings of this study identified possible combinations of severe dengue, which would provide enhanced insight into clinical management and inform prevention programming for severe dengue.
