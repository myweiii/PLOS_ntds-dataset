    "Background": "Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by an intracellular protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii. It is usually asymptomatic, but toxoplasmosis acquired during pregnancy can cause congenital toxoplasmosis, potentially resulting in fetal damage. Epidemiological information is lacking for toxoplasmosis in Mayotte (a French overseas territory). We evaluated (1) the prevalence of maternal toxoplasmosis, (2) the incidence of maternal and congenital toxoplasmosis, and (3) the management of congenital toxoplasmosis in Mayotte.",
    "Methodology / Principal Findings": "We collected all the available data for toxoplasmosis serological screening during pregnancy and maternal and congenital cases of toxoplasmosis obtained between January 2017 and August 2019 at the central public laboratory of Mayotte (Mamoudzou). Using toxoplasmosis serological data from samples collected from 16,952 pregnant women we estimated the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in Mayotte at 67.19%. Minimum maternal toxoplasmosis incidence was estimated at 0.29% (49/16,952, 95% CI (0.0022\u20130.0038)), based on confirmed cases of maternal primary infection only. The estimated incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis was 0.09% (16/16,952, 95% CI (0.0005\u20130.0015). Missing data made it difficult to evaluate management, but follow-up was better for mothers with confirmed primary infection and their infants.",
    "Conclusions / Significance": "The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis among pregnant women and the incidence of toxoplasmosis are higher in Mayotte than in mainland France. There is a need to improve the antenatal toxoplasmosis screening and prevention programme, providing better information to physicians and the population, to improve management and epidemiological monitoring."
