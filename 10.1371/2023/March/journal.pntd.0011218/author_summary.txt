Bacteria inside mosquitoes’ guts have been found to have an impact on mosquito life history traits (such as longevity and fecundity) as well as their susceptibility to infection by human pathogens. Engineering these communities may provide an effective and safe way to control mosquitoes and reduce the impact of the pathogens they spread. In this work, we assayed the bacteria found in midgut and crop tissues of a medically important mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Our results show that these tissues harbor communities of bacteria that differ in composition and function and vary in abundance. Experiments like ours are important to better understand where bacteria are found in an insect’s body and how these communities assemble. This knowledge may help future researchers more successfully engineer bacterial communities in mosquitoes.
