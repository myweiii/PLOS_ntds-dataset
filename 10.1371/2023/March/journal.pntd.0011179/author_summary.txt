Childhood diarrhoea, a major cause of mortality in low-income countries (LICs), is known to be influenced by seasonal variations. Studies on the seasonality of diarrhoeal pathogens have mostly been conducted in the temperate zone where the seasons differ by temperature. In Guinea-Bissau and many other LICs, seasonality is characterized by precipitation changes with negligible temperature variations. The monsoon-type rainy season lasts from June to October and the dry season from November to May. We expect this seasonality to influence stool pathogen distribution.
To investigate the associations between various diarrhoeal pathogens and seasonality in childhood diarrhoea in Guinea-Bissau, we explored a large variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic agents among children with and without diarrhoea during the rainy versus dry seasons.
We found diarrhoeal pathogens not to be equally present over the year but show seasonal variation with respect to age and precipitation. The waterborne Cryptosporidium showed highest prevalence during the wetter months, while viral pathogens (adenovirus, astrovirus and rotavirus) were found most frequently during the arid months. Of bacterial pathogens, EAEC, ETEC, and Campylobacter prevailed in the rainy season. Such data add to our understanding of childhood diarrhoea in LICs and serve as a tool for devising preventive measures.
