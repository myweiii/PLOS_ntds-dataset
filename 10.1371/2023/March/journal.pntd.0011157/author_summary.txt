Having standardized, comparative studies of Zika virus (ZIKV) tests are important for implementing optimal diagnostic testing and disease surveillance. Detection of ZIKV nucleic acid is ideal for confirming infection; however, knowing the sensitivity and specificity of a test is needed for selecting the right test in a given laboratory. We looked at the analytical performance of 15 diagnostic and blood screening ZIKV molecular tests, including tests that detect ZIKV only and tests that detect ZIKV plus other arboviruses. We found donor screening NAT assays were significantly more sensitive than diagnostic RT-qPCR assays, mostly due to the higher sample input volumes. We also found no difference in analytical sensitivity between tests that only detected ZIKV compared to tests that detected ZIKV and related viruses. The ideal molecular test will depend on the testing context, with other factors such as cost, instrumentation, and regulatory approval status influencing assay availability and selection.
