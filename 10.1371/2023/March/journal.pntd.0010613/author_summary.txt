Vector-borne diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical countries. Efficient control strategies require detailed understanding of vector species distribution and behavior in human environments. General public awareness-building that selected animal species carry and transmit dangerous human-infective parasites is also key. This study details long-term spatiotemporal prevalence patterns of hematophagous Chagas disease vectors known as triatomines based on the collection of specimens from domiciliary areas of greater Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. A citizen science-based sample collection approach is used to simultaneously help educate the public on Chagas disease and prevention. Microscopy indicates that triatomines found inside homes by inhabitants of the city are often positive for the Chagas disease parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Specimens found inside homes also occasionally involve nymphs. Such evidence of indoor reproduction is found in various parts of the city. Genetic analyses of triatomine intestinal content further indicate that domiciliary triatomine occurrence is facilitated by feeding on human blood. Bloodmeals on various other domesticated and wild animal species are also identified, suggesting an extensive T. cruzi transmission network spanning urban and sylvatic environments. Results compel greater attention toward Chagas disease surveillance in Caracas. A human serological survey for T. cruzi, especially in the pediatric population, would help clarify the consequences of triatomine infection and human-triatomine contact events demonstrated from this studyâ€™s citizen science-based dataset.
