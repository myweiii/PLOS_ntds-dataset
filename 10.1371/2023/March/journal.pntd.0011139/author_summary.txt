Implementation research (IR) focuses on how to improve access to, and distribution and use of disease control interventions, which are under-utilised in many low- and middle-income countries. Effective implementation of disease control interventions can have significant impacts by reducing illness and mortality. Despite this, IR is not widely recognised, researched or taught. Education and training in IR is not readily available or accessible and, for this reason, Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) developed a massive open online course (MOOC) on the topic of IR with a focus on infectious diseases of poverty (IDPs). A MOOC is a free online course that anyone can participate in and can provide training and education to large audiences of learners. A MOOC may consist of online media, short videos, lectures, case studies, quizzes and other assessments, online discussion forums, and readings. The TDR IR MOOC targeted field researchers and public health practitioners facing problems in the implementation of control programmes in low- and middle-income countries and was open to anyone who was interested. In this study, we explore the demographics of those who registered for, participated in, and completed the MOOC, and whether the MOOC increased their knowledge of the topic. Findings reveal that registrants were most commonly from the WHO African region, were English language speakers and public health researchers. The MOOC was found to be successful in increasing learnersâ€™ knowledge in implementation research.
