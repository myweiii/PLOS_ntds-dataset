Infection caused by Schistosoma mansoni is a major neglected tropical disease with significant associated morbidity. New tools, such as vaccines, are needed due to the inadequacy of current control strategies. Tetraspanin-2 of S. mansoni (Sm-TSP-2) is one of the lead vaccine candidates for hepatic/intestinal schistosomiasis. Antibodies induced by this vaccine are postulated to interfere with the development of the tegument of adult S. mansoni worms, thereby impairing their development and survival. We conducted a Phase 1 trial of recombinant Sm-TSP-2 adjuvanted with Alhydrogel in 60 healthy adults living in Brazil. Each participant received three vaccinations every 2 months by intramuscular injection of the vaccine administered with or without an aqueous solution of the Toll-like receptor-4 agonist, Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (AP 10–701). Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel was well tolerated in schistosomiasis-exposed adults; no vaccine-related severe or serious adverse events were observed. Antigen-specific IgG antibodies were induced in a dose-dependent fashion with increasing levels observed after each vaccination. The addition of AP 10–701 to the vaccine resulted in significantly higher antibody responses. Based on these results, the vaccine has been advanced into a Phase 2 clinical trial in an endemic region of Africa.
