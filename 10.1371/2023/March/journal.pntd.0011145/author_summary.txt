Leishmaniasis is one of the major neglected tropical diseases caused by members of the genus Leishmania. It can manifest in the symptoms ranging from rapidly self-healing ulcers in the cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to systemic multiorgan failures in the cases of visceral leishmaniasis. The CL can be of anthroponotic (ACL, mainly caused by L. tropica) and zoonotic (ZCL, mainly caused by L. major) origin. In Central Asia, great gerbils are the main animal reservoirs for ZCL. These animals may be co-infected with L. major, L. turanica, and L. gerbilli. The evolution in Leishmania is driven by clonality and genetic exchange, with geographical isolation playing an important role. In this sense, Leishmania spp. may either co-exist in the same area (mixed infections) or be geographically isolated without mixing-up with other species (monospecific infections). Leishmania turanica in Central Asia presents a good model to compare these two modes. Indeed, in most areas of great gerbilsâ€™ distribution, populations of Leishmania spp. are mixed. Conversely, the populations of L. turanica in Mongolia are monospecific and geographically isolated. In this work, we compare genomes of several strains of L. turanica in order to shed light on genetic factors, which may drive evolution of these important parasites.
