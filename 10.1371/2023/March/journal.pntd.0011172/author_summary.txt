The Brazilian Amazon is the region of the Americas that has the highest incidence of SBEs, and indigenous populations are disproportionately affected. In order for Brazil to achieve a reduction in mortality and disability from snakebite envenomations, it is vital to understand how indigenous and professional healthcare sectors interact in indigenous villages. The indigenous caregivers interviewed explained that the occurrence of a snakebite can be a natural event, usually due to the lack of attention of an indigenous person during their daily activities in the forest, or a supernatural event that was caused as a punishment or by witchcraft. The latter type of snakebites is more serious and it is difficult to intervene to promote healing. Indigenous caregivers recommend a series of rituals in order to protect an individual from snakebite or heal the already diseased body. In addition, a series of therapeutic resources derived from plants and animals is used for treatment and rehabilitation of the indigenous person. In this itinerary, there is no impediment on the part of the caregivers to include a stay in hospital in order to carry out the treatment with antivenom and other care deemed necessary by the doctors. This finding is crucial to improve the effectiveness of snakebite treatment in an integrated biomedical-indigenous model, thus reducing the contradictions and tensions present in the daily practices of both health teams and indigenous caregivers. The engagement with local caregivers to combine the indigenous health care model with a timely referral of SBE patients to a facility equipped with antivenom is a major determinant of success in the control of SBEs.
