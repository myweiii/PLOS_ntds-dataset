Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by the bite of infected chigger mites transmitting O. tsutsugamushi, a Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria in the family Rickettsiaceae. The disease progression and clinical manifestations are closely associated with host immune responses. T cell responses are in strong relation with immune protection against scrub typhus. As there is limited knowledge on specific T cell roles against scrub typhus, we optimized a flow-cytometer based protocol to assess O. tsutsugumushi-specific T cell responses in whole blood samples, which is suitable for studies in limited resource settings. This method requires low blood volumes, but enables multiparametric immunophenotyping assessments. The optimized WBA protocol could be a useful tool for comprehensive immunopathological studies in scrub typhus, and other infectious diseases as well as vaccine studies in areas with limited availability of specialized equipment, while reliably capturing the complexity of the immune response.
