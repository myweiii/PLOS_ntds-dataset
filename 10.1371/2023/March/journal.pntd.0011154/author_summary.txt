The emergence and re-emergence of alphaviruses as important human pathogens raises questions about the durability and breadth of alphavirus immunity following natural infection in humans. In this study, we examine human immune sera from twelve individuals infected (up to 24 years) previously with chikungunya virus and test the sera against a panel of five Old-World arthritogenic alphaviruses and one New-World encephalitic alphavirus. Both homotypic and cross-reactive memory B-cells were identified in subjects out to 24 years post infection. Our results indicate that infection with chikungunya virus results in a robust and durable cross-reactive humoral immune response. Such a response could potentially provide immunity against repeat infection with chikungunya as well as related alphaviruses for years to decades after initial infection. This cross-reactivity might contribute to restricted transmission of closely related alphaviruses and indicates the potential for chikungunya candidate vaccines to elicit broad protection against other alphaviruses in the Semliki Forest complex.
