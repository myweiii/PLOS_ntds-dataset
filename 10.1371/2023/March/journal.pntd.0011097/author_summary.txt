Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an acute febrile disease caused by a bite from a tick carrying the SFTS virus. This new infectious disease is observed mainly in Korea, China, and Japan. In Korea, SFTS incidence reported in Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency is an average of 233 cases between 2016 and 2020, with 39 deaths and a fatality rate of 16.68%. SFTS patients are observed nationwide, including Jeju Island, but there are currently no data regarding the national prevalence of SFTS, including that of residents of 16 cities and provinces. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of SFTS in Korea. A total of 1500 participants were selected through random sampling from the 2014–2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. An indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay was performed to assess immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM antibody titers against SFTS virus. Of the 1500 participants, 55 (3.7%) tested positive for IgG and 1 (0.1%) tested positive for IgM, with antibody titer of ≥ 1:32. Approximately 3.9% and 2.5% of participants in urban and rural areas, respectively, had a positive titer of ≥ 1:32. There was a significant correlation between SFTS incidence per 100,000 population and seroprevalence using an IgG titer ≥ 1:64 as the cut-off value. This is the first study to investigate national SFTS seroprevalence across all 16 cities and provinces representing Korea; furthermore, our study will also provide useful guidelines for the development of preventive measures against SFTS.
