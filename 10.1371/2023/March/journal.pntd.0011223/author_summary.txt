Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) is a neglected tropical illness caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi, characterized a persistent inflammatory response driven by parasite persistence in the infected tissues. In this study, authors investigated the miRNA expression pattern in the cardiac tissue of chronically T. cruzi-infected mice treated with benznidazole (Bz), the immunomodulator pentoxifylline alone (PTX), or the combination of both (Bz+PTX). All treatment regimens improved electrocardiographic alterations and clinical parameters, while miRNA profiling revealed considerable alterations in expression. Infected group showed pathways related to organismal abnormalities, cellular development, skeletal muscle development, cardiac enlargement, and fibrosis, likely associated with CCC. Bz group is mainly affecting cell cycle, cell death and survival, tissue morphology, and connective tissue function pathways. On the other hand, Bz+PTX-treated group is mainly affecting cellular growth and proliferation, tissue development, cardiac fibrosis, damage, and necrosis/cell death pathways. Surprisingly, miR-146b-5p upregulation in the infected group was reversed upon Bz and Bz+PTX treatment regimens, highlighting its importance as a biomarker of therapeutic response. Our results help understanding the molecular pathways related to CCC progression and evaluation of treatment response in Chagas disease.
