Adjuvant-free cysteine peptidases consistently elicited remarkable reduction in challenge schistosome worm burden in outbred rodents, whether used in an enzymatically active or inactive construct. The findings together suggested that peptide sequences shared by these cysteine peptidases may substitute for the whole molecule and form the basis of a safe, cost-effective, chimeric protein vaccine, easy to manufacture and deliver in countries with limited resources. In support, multiple antigen peptide (MAP) construct of two peptides, MAP-1 and MAP-2, showing high homology to helminth gut cysteine peptidases induced 25%-30% reduction in challenge Schistosoma mansoni worm burden in outbred mice. It was, however, necessary to modify the vaccine formula to counteract the effect on the parasite egg counts and vitality. Immunization of mice with MAP-2 in combination with alum and/or MAP-1 elicited reduction of around 60% in challenge S. mansoni worm burden and no increase in worm eggsâ€™ loads or vitality, compared to unimmunized or alum pre-treated control mice. Considerable increase in liver interleukin-1, arachidonic acid, and reactive oxygen species content in MAP-immunized compared to control mice appeared to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the dual impact of the cysteine peptidase-based schistosomiasis vaccine.
