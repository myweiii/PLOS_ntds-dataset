The South African bont tick Amblyomma hebraeum is an important vector of heartwater, a debilitating disease of livestock with devastating economic and social impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The causative agent of heartwater is the intracellular proteobacterium Ehrlichia ruminantium. To date a single decades-old live vaccine constitutes the main strategy of controlling heartwater infection but is ineffective against heterologous strains of the pathogen in the field. In our study we delineate the molecular mechanism of A. hebraeum tick midgut genes in response to E. ruminantium infection. We performed comparative analyses of infected midgut transcriptomes of engorged nymphs, unfed and partly-fed adult ticks with their corresponding age-matched uninfected controls. We present differentially expressed genes that may act as barriers or gateways for E. ruminantium in tick midgut-cell entry and warrant further investigations in order to develop novel intervention strategies such as anti-tick vaccine candidate molecules. Previous transcriptomic studies have only described E. ruminantium genes induced during infection in vitro and at the tick bite-site or salivary glands.
