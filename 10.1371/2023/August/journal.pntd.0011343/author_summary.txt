Tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus cause severe zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock, which goes along with substantial burden on human and veterinary health and big economic losses. Most relevant to human health are the species E. multilocularis and E. granulosus s.l., which are two closely related parasites that cause alveolar and cystic echinococcosis, respectively. Both diseases have limited treatment options, which is why there is a strong need for new drugs against these neglected tropical diseases.
Efficacy of new drugs against E. multilocularis can be assessed via various standardized in vitro assays. For E. granulosus, activity of drugs is currently mainly assessed via optical readout methods, which are time consuming and are not easily carried out in a blinded manner.
We here describe the application of several standardized in vitro drug screening assays targeting different parasite stages and isolated germinal layer cells of E. granulosus s.s. We have performed these assays in a comparative manner including E. multilocularis and tested various standard drugs with known activity in these assays.
All assays could be applied to E. granulosus s.s. and this will allow for standardized, higher throughput testing against this parasite in the future.
