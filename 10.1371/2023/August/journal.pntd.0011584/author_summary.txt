To date there is a lack of safe treatment options to be used for the control of Loa loa transmission in highly endemic regions. This study assessed the parasitological efficacy of albendazole alone (three or five weeks regimen) or albendazole (three weeks regimen) with a single dose of ivermectin for the reduction of microfilaraemia in adult patients in Gabon. This proof of concept study showed highest efficacy of about 90% reduction of microfilaraemia when albendazole was given twice daily for five weeks or albendazole was administered twice daily for three weeks followed by single dose ivermectin. As there were no safety concerns these findings indicate that albendazole based treatment regimens may in principle be useful for implementation in population-based control programs. To overcome the problem associated with prolonged oral treatment regimens new injectable drug formulations with extended release of active substances may be considered to facilitate implementation of such control programs.
