rLj-RGD3 is a recombinant protein derived from the buccal gland secretion of Lampetra japonica, a blood-sucking fish found in Heilongjiang River, China. It has 118 amino acids and a molecular weight of 13.5 kDa. It contains three RGD motifs and has a unique primary and secondary structure. Research has shown that rLj-RGD3 inhibits platelet aggregation by competing with integrin interactions, particularly with the αIIbβ3 integrin on platelet surfaces. Its potential as an antithrombotic drug has been recognized. For example, it could potentially be used as a treatment for malaria, a tropical disease caused by a parasitic infection, which is often accompanied by blood clots. To facilitate its development, a pharmacokinetic study is essential, necessitating the quantification of rLj-RGD3 in plasma. Here, a highly sensitive and specific double sandwich BA-ELISA method has been developed and validated to quantify rLj-RGD3 in plasma at the picogram level. This method fully meets stringent acceptance criteria for the PK study of rLj-RGD3 and will support future pharmacokinetic studies and contribute to the potential therapeutic applications of rLj-RGD3 in certain tropical diseases.
