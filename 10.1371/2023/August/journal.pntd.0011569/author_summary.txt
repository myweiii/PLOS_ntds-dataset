There is limited information on pit viper bite in Malaysia which may also reflects poor awareness and documentation. This study analysed RECS consultation log, frequency, species involved, geographical distribution and clinical management outcomes of pit viper bites in Malaysia from 2017â€“2020. RECS provides reliable and rapid information on snake species identification, location of incidence and the appropriate choice of antivenom when indicated. Pit vipers in Malaysia are classified into several genus and their geographical distribution is not homogenous. Not all pit vipers cause significant envenomation to human and requiring antivenom. All three types of antivenoms appropriate for pit viper envenomation were manufactured and imported from Thailand. From this study, the optimal management and appropriate antivenom stock for each hospital can be determined.
