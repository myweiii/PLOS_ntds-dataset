Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease with a global scale that results in over 100,000 fatalities per year and morbidity rates surpassing 450,000 individuals. This study focuses on the mechanisms behind venom-induced tissue damage, more specifically on cytotoxicity and extracellular matrix degradation. We applied a combination of cellular assays and fluorescent microscopy to study the effects of crude and fractionated venoms of a selection of medically relevant snake species. Our findings reveal a notable difference in the way in which viper venoms and elapid venoms exert their effects on cells. The study comprises both morphological data as well as quantitative data on cell metabolism and viability over time. This data could be valuable for better understanding venom-induced cell damage and may prove useful in the process of developing and improving treatments for (local) tissue damage.
