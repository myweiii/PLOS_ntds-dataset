Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease, with over 200,000 new cases reported annually. The disease caused by L. braziliensis leads to chronic ulcerated lesions that often fail conventional treatment, and thus, new therapies to control the disease are needed. One of the major factors promoting increased disease and treatment failure is the recruitment of cytolytic T cells to the cutaneous lesions, which promotes increased inflammation without controlling the parasites. This study explores the role of the innate receptor NKG2D in L. braziliensis patients. Using clinical samples from L. braziliensis patients, we demonstrate that NKG2D is expressed in leishmanial lesions, identify factors that promote NKG2D and NKG2D ligand expression, and find that NKG2D gene expression is associated with treatment failure. Based on these results, we propose that targeting NKG2D might be considered as a therapy to dampen disease severity in L. braziliensis patients.
