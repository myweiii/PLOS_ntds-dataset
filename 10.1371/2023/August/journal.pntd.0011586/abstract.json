    "Abstract": "Knowledge about mitogenomes has been proven to be essential in human parasite diagnostics and understanding of their diversity. However, the lack of substantial data for comparative analysis is still a challenge in Trichuris trichiura research. To provide high quality mitogenomes, we utilized long-read sequencing technology of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to better resolve repetitive regions and to construct de novo mitogenome assembly minimizing reference biases. In this study, we got three de novo assembled mitogenomes of T. trichiura isolated from Korean individuals. These circular complete mitogenomes of T. trichiura are 14,508 bp, 14,441 bp, and 14,440 bp in length. A total of 37 predicted genes were identified consisting of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNAs) genes, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes (rrnS and rrnL), and two non-coding regions. Interestingly, the assembled mitogenome has up to six times longer AT-rich regions than previous reference sequences, thus proving the advantage of long-read sequencing in resolving unreported non-coding regions. Furthermore, variant detection and phylogenetic analysis using concatenated protein coding genes, cox1, rrnL, and nd1 genes confirmed the distinct molecular identity of this newly assembled mitogenome while at the same time showing high genetic relationship with sequences from China or Tanzania. Our study provided a new set of reference mitogenome with better contiguity and resolved repetitive regions that could be used for meaningful phylogenetic analysis to further understand disease transmission and parasite biology."
