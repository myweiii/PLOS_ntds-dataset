Human trichuriasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by human whipworm Trichuris trichiura remains persistent in South Korea. Despite its medical importance, genomic data about their mitochondrial DNA is scarce. In this study, we used the long-read sequencing technology of Oxford Nanopore Technologies to provide high-quality complete mitogenomes of three T. trichiura isolated from Korean individuals. Interestingly, our assembled mitogenomes produced up to six times longer AT-rich regions that were not reported by previous reference mitogenome sequence proving the advantage of long-read sequencing over the short-read sequencing technologies. Also, comparative analysis through variant detection and phylogenetics confirmed the distinction of our newly assembled mitogenomes over the existing references in the database. Provision of these mitogenome information is fundamental in identifying genetic markers leading to a more reliable and precise helminth diagnostics.
