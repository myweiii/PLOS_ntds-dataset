HFRS caused by orthohantavirus is a serious public health problem in the Yichun region in Jiangxi Province, China. However, little information is known about the infection of orthohantavirus in humans and rodents, and the genetic characteristics of the epidemic orthohantavirus in the region. To reveal the above problems, we analyzed the epidemiology of HFRS and performed a molecular investigation of orthohantavirus in the Yichun region. During 2016â€“2021, a total of 1,573 HFRS cases were recorded with an average fatality rate of 0.70%. HFRS consistently occurred and peaked in winter and early summer in the Yichun region, it was a mixed epidemic area of HFRS dominated by HTNV. We identified new genetic variants of SEOV, HTNV, and DBSV from rodent lung samples in the Yichun region, which shows the high genetic diversity of the orthohantaviruses. Special attention should be paid to the high genetic diversity of orthohantavirus when developing vaccines and antiviral drugs. We also found the new genetic variant of HTNV from rodents caused human infection and was the main prevalent virus of human infection in the Yichun region. These results will provide very important information for HFRS control in the Yichun region and other areas in the world.
