Mass Drug administration (MDA) with multiple drugs is common for the treatment and control of lymphatic filariasis (LF). This study aimed to determine whether the incorporation of moxidectin (MOX) into MDA regimens for LF will alter the pharmacokinetics (PK) of co-administered drugs. In the context of a clinical trial, we investigated the PK and drug interactions of a combination of moxidectin (MOX) plus albendazole (ALB) with or without diethylcarbamazine (DEC) compared to ivermectin (IVM) plus ALB with or without DEC. The study was conducted in adult patients located in Côte d’Ivoire. The addition of MOX did not alter the exposure (AUC0-t) or maximum concentration (Cmax) of co-administered drugs. These results suggest the incorporation of MOX into current MDA LF treatment programs will not result in clinically significant alterations in drug exposure.
