Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the chief cause of preventable blindness worldwide. A key component of the WHO’s elimination strategy is mass treatment with oral antibiotics, education relating to facial cleanliness, environmental improvement, and hygienic conditions. It is crucial to conduct community-based prevalence of trachoma by incorporating community-level factors to determine whether community-level interventions are necessary. A thorough understanding of the risk factors of trachoma may foster trachoma elimination efforts. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of active trachoma in andabet district by using a multi-level mixed-effect analysis. This study found that 35.37% of children (1–9 years) in the Andabet district have active trachoma in 2023, which is a public health concern. In addition, Individual and community-level factors associated with the diseases were identified. This study demonstrates the need to consider support for the introduction of those interventions for trachoma elimination in Ethiopia. This will eliminate an estimated half of the global burden.
