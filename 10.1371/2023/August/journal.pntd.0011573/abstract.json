    "Background": "Trachoma is the chief cause of preventable blindness worldwide and has been earmarked for elimination as a public health problem by 2030. Despite the five-year Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement (SAFE)-based interventions in the Andabet district, the prevalence of trachomatous follicular (TF) was 37%. With such a high prevalence of TF, the determinant factors were not revealed. Besides, there were no reports on the overall prevalence of active trachoma (i.e.TF and or trachomatous intense (TI)).",
    "Objective": "To determine the prevalence and associated factors of active trachoma among 1\u20139 years of age children in the Andabet district.",
    "Method": "A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged under nine years from March 1\u201330, 2023 in Andabet district, Northwest Ethiopia. Multi-stage systematic random sampling was employed to reach 540 children. A multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression analysis was employed to assess factors associated with active trachoma. We fitted both random effect and fixed effect analysis. Finally, variables with p<0.05 in the multivariable multilevel analysis were claimed to be significantly associated with active trachoma.",
    "Result": "In this study, the overall prevalence of active trachoma was 35.37% (95% CI: 31.32%, 39.41%). The prevalence of TF and TI was 31.3% and 4.07% respectively. In the multilevel logistic regression analysis ocular discharge, fly-eye contact, latrine utilization, and source of water were significantly associated with the prevalence of active trachoma.",
    "Conclusion": "In this study, the prevalence of active trachoma was much higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) threshold prevalence. Ocular discharge, fly-eye contact, latrine utilization, and source of water were independent determinants of active trachoma among children (1\u20139 years). Therefore, paying special attention to these high-risk groups could decrease the prevalence of a neglected hyperendemic disease, active trachoma."
