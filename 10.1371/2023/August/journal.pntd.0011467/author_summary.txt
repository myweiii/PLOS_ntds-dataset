Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a serious parasitic zoonotic disease that resembles malignancy with clinically silent infiltrative growth predominantly involving the liver. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with N = 12 AE patients focusing on their disease-related psychosocial burden, coping strategies, information seeking behavior, and subjective illness concepts. All participants perceived AE as a severe disease with inextricably linked biological, psychological, and social effects. Key positive influences reported included the provision of information and access to informal and formal support, including the ability to lead active personal and professional lives for as long as possible. Self-directed, web-based information seeking often led to increased feelings of hopelessness and anxiety. Disease-related apprehensions, and to prevent stigmatization, health professionals need to provide AE patients with comprehensive disease-related information to improve patient and social awareness.
