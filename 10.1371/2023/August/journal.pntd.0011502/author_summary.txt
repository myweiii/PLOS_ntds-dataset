In spite of international and national effort to reduce or eliminate podoconiosis, this study revealed high number of podoconiosis cases in Bensa district, Sidama Regional State, Ethiopia. This study demonstrated shoe as one of the most important factor associated with the occurrence of podoconiosis.
