We are grateful for assistance from many residents of visited hamlets and local authorities during plague response fieldwork. We also thank Kenneth L. Gage from the Bacterial Diseases Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, for providing fleas from Uganda, which were an important comparison for the fleas from Madagascar. We are grateful to laboratory technicians, scientists, and administrative staff of the IPM Medical Entomology and Plague units, especially Malala N. Rakotomanga, Tojo R. Ramihangihajason, Manambina N. Randrianjatovo and Mandimby Rajaonarimanana. Lastly, we thank SÃ©bastien Boyer, former head of the IPM Medical Entomology Unit.
