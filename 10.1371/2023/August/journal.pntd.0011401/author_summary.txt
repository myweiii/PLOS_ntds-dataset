In Madagascar, the Oriental rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis is the primary vector of Yersinia pestis, which causes plague. This flea has been reported to be resistant to insecticides used for vector control. The objective of this study was to examine the target site mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene in X. cheopis populations sampled throughout the island and previously tested for synthetic pyrethroid (SPs) susceptibility. Two widespread mutations associated with knock-down resistance (kdr) to SPs were identified, and a significant relationship between the frequency of kdr alleles and the SP resistance phenotype was revealed. The results raise concerns about the overall efficacy of SPs for controlling Yersinia pestis transmission by X. cheopis in Madagascar.
