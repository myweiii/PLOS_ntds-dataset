Spotted fever group rickettsiae, Anapalsma, and Ehrlichia are tick-borne bacteria, which can cause severe human and animal infection and/or extensive economic losses in animal husbandry. It has been well documented that some Ixodidae ticks are able to transmit Rickettsia, Anaplasma, and Ehrlichia, while the studies on transovarial transmission are limited. In this study, we detected 7 rickettsial species in the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus in Hunan Province of the Southern China. Among them, Candidatus Rickettsia xinyangensis and A. platys were also found in the tick eggs and laboratory-hatched larvae of R. microplus, suggesting the vertical transmission of these two pathogens in R. microplus. Our findings provide important information regarding the distribution and ecology of these tick-borne rickettsiae.
