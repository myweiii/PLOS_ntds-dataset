Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a parasitic zoonotic infection of dogs caused by Leishmania spp. parasites. In Brazil, CanL is among the most important vector-borne parasitic diseases. Dogs are the main reservoirs of the disease and in some countries have been regularly culled as part of government policy to control human leishmaniasis. The identification of infected dogs, regardless of the clinical condition, is necessary as part of the prevention and control measures of the disease in the canine population and consequently in the human population. In this context, it is necessary serological tests, composed of antigens capable of correctly identifying infected, asymptomatic, as well as symptomatic dogs, minimizing the number of false negative cases. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the efficacy between two previously described whole proteins (rDyn-1 and rKDDR-plus) with their more immunoreactive synthetic peptides to sera from symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs selected in immunoblotting assays and to evaluate in ELISA assays. ELISA using the rDyn-1 protein and mixed peptides showed high performance in the diagnosis of CanL.
