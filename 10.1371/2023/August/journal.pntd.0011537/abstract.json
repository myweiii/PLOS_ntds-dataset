    "Abstract": "Severe dengue occurrence has been attributed to increasing age and different dengue virus (DENV) serotypes that cause secondary infections and immune-enhancing phenomena. Therefore, we examined if the effect of age on dengue severity was mediated by infectivity status while controlling for sex and region. Further, we assessed the spatial clustering of dengue severity for individuals with primary and secondary infection across Mexican municipalities. Health data from 2012 to 2017 was retrieved from Mexico\u2019s Ministry of Health. A mediation analysis was performed using multiple logistic regression models based on a directed acyclic graph. The models were explored for the direct effect of age on dengue severity and its indirect impact through secondary infection. In addition, severe dengue clusters were determined in some Northeastern and Southeastern municipalities through spatial analysis. We observed a nonlinear trend between age and severe dengue. There was a downward trend of severe dengue for individuals between 0 and 10 years and an upward trend above 10 years. The effect of age on dengue severity was no longer significant for individuals between 10 and 60 years after introducing infectivity status into the model. The mediating role of infectivity status in the causal model was 17%. Clustering of severe dengue among individuals with primary infection in the Northeastern region may point to the high prevalence of DENV-3 in the region. Public health efforts may prevent secondary infection among infants and the aged. In addition, there should be a further investigation into the effect of DENV-3 in individuals with primary disease."
