Snakebite is a neglected disease with a dearth of data and research funding. This study aimed to quantify the burden and identify risk factors of snakebite in a rural district in Mozambique by nesting snakebite-specific questions into a demographic survey conducted in preparation for a malaria cluster-randomized trial.
We have shown that nesting has the potential to undo the neglect of snakebite research, providing valuable results for local decision makers and aid further research. Piggy-backing onto a large well-resourced trial enabled us to reveal the burden and identify risk factors of snakebite with minimal disruption or expense to the parent trial team or participants. This method can encourage the global health community to transition into a more horizontal research approach.
We report an incidence close to 400 snakebite per 100,000 population per year in Mopeia leading to the loss of over 3,000 days of work/school. The median economic burden of snakebite per household was of US$ 17, making it almost 5-fold the cost of uncomplicated malaria cases. Although most bites occurred in those aged 20 to 25, the rate of bites per 1,000 population is much higher in those adults older than 64, this finding is also coupled with a lower recovery rate in the older age. We found no clear risk factor associated with place of bite and season.
