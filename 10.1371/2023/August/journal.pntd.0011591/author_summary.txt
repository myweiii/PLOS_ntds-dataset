The mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are known to transmit Zika virus (ZIKV) but it is important to identify other potential secondary vectors. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to answer this question. We searched four databases (PubMed, Lilacs, Cochrane Library Web of Science), WHOLIS and Google Scholar using different combinations of Zika, Aedes, Culex, vector, or competence in the title/abstract, up to March 2022. Most of the studies reviewed were of high quality methodologically, but the methods were different making it hard to compare them. There is a need for standardization to better interpret these studies and make appropriate recommendations. Secondary vectors of ZIKV with evidence of low transmission rates comparable to primary vectors are Ae. japonicus, Ae. detritus and Ae. vexans at higher temperatures. Culex quinquefasciatus was not found to be a competent vector of ZIKV. Future research should focus on well-defined and established experimental approaches (midguts/bodies for infection, legs+wings/heads for dissemination and the use of murine models/other artificial feeding systems). Importantly, development of large collaborative multi-country projects are needed to conduct large scale evaluations of specific mosquito species with common protocols to appropriately address the inherent geographic variation in both mosquito and ZIKV strains.
