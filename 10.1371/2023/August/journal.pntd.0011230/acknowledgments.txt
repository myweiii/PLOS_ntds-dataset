We would like to pay special thanks to Prof. Bamba Vagamon and Prof. Almamy Diabate (Université Alassane Ouattara, Service de Dermatologie CHU de Bouaké-Côte d’Ivoire) for their support in making diagnosis of skin diseases on site and remotely. We would also like to thank all members of the project teams in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana for making this study possible.
