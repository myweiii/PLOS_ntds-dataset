The diagnosis of skin diseases depends in large part, though not exclusively on visual inspection. The diagnosis and management of these diseases is thus particularly amenable to teledermatology approaches. The widespread availability of cell phone technology and electronic information transfer provides new potential for access to health care in low-income countries, yet there are limited efforts targeting these neglected populations with dark skin and consequently limited availability of tools. In this study, we leveraged a collection of skin images gathered through a system of teledermatology in the West African countries of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, and applied deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI)—to see if deep learning models can distinguish between different diseases and support their diagnosis. Skin-related neglected tropical diseases, or skin NTDs, prevail in these regions and were our target conditions: Buruli ulcer, leprosy, mycetoma, scabies, and yaws. The accuracy of prediction depended on the number of images that were fed into the model for training with marginal improvement using laboratory confirmed cases in training. Using more images and greater efforts in this area, it is possible that AI can help address the unmet needs where access to medical care is limited.
