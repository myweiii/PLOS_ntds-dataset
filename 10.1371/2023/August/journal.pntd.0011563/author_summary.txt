To carry out studies on mosquitoes including if they can transmit viruses, are resistant to insecticides, how far they can fly, and how long they live, scientists raise mosquitoes in laboratories where they must feed them blood to produce large numbers of similar sized mosquitoes. We developed a low-cost device made with materials available at most hardware stores throughout the world. We compare “Caserotek” to other commercially available blood feeding methods, thorough two experiments with Aedes aegypti and one with Anopheles darlingi. We fed Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes on chicken blood once per week for 30 min (Experiment #1) for 14 days or 1 hour (Experiment #2) for 21 days. We fed Anopheles darlingi for 1 hour (Experiment #3). We measured how well mosquitoes fed on blood (feeding rates), how well the blood fed mosquitoes survived, and how many eggs the mosquitoes laid. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes fed for 30 minutes, fed best on Caserotek (91.1%) compared to 47.7% and 29.3% on Hemotek and the glass feeder, respectively. When Aedes aegypti fed for 1-hour feeding rates, were good (91%) on Caserotek and the glass feeder, but lower on Hemotek (78%). Thirty-day survival was similar among the feeding devices, ranging from 86% to 99%. Average egg production was highest for the Caserotek feeder (32 eggs per female) compared to the glass feeder and Hemotek device (21–22 eggs per female). Caserotek performed well compared to other more expensive feeding devices. Caserotek only requires the ability to boil water to maintain blood temperatures using a Styrofoam liner. It can be easily scaled up to large production facilities and used under austere conditions.
