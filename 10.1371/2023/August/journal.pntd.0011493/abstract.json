    "Background": "Individuals with leprosy are at risk of leprosy reactions, T-cell mediated immunological complications, which lead to nerve function impairment. Leprosy reactions require systemic immunosuppression which is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 infection is recommended in the UK and became widely available in 2021 with individuals at increased risk of severe disease, including the immunosuppressed, prioritised.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status of individuals diagnosed with leprosy attending the Leprosy Clinic in 2021 and whether any had developed leprosy or experienced a new leprosy reaction within twelve weeks of receiving a dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The electronic patient records were used to retrieve data.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The development of BT leprosy and a Type 1 reaction in another individual shortly after a dose of BNT162b2 vaccine may be associated with vaccine mediated T cell responses. The benefits of vaccination to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 outweigh these unwanted events but data from leprosy endemic countries may provide further information about potential adverse effects of augmented T cell responses in individuals with leprosy or latent M. leprae infection."
