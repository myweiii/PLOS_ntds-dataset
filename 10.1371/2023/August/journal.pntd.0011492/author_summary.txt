Self-application of a cream containing antibiotics of the well-known aminoglycoside family (paromomycin and/or gentamicin) cures cutaneous leishmaniasis without injections, but this treatment had not been evaluated yet in travelers. In a group of 40 travelers with cutaneous leishmaniasis we observed that more more than 75% of them cured. Adverse events were mild to moderate pruritus and pain that occurred in less than one fourth of the patients. Our results confirm that widespread availability of a topical aminoglycoside cream would be a simple and effective treatment solution for most adults and children suffering from cutaneous leishmaniasis.
