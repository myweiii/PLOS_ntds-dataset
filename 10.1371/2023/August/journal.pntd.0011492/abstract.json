    "Background": "In endemic foci, the use of an aquaphilic cream containing paromomycin with/without gentamicin to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is safe, painless and cures 78\u201382% of patients with New and Old World CL. Self-application in travelers requires evaluation.",
    "Methods": "Travelers with 1\u201310 lesions of confirmed CL were prospectively treated with the paromomycin-gentamicin formulation (WR279396, 2012\u20132017, Group 1) and carefully follow up, or treated with a locally produced paromomycin-only cream (2018\u20132022, Group 2). The cream was applied once under supervision, then self-applied daily for 20\u201330 days. A cured lesion was defined as 100% re-epithelialization at day 42 without relapse at three months.",
    "Results": "Medical features were similar in Group 1 (17 patients), and Group 2 (23 patients). Patients were infected with either Leishmania major, L. infantum, L. killicki, L. guyanensis, L. braziliensis, or L. naiffi. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol cure rates were 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) [64.23;100.00]) and 87% (95% CI [71,29;100.00]) in Group 1, and 69% (95% CI [50.76; 88.37]) and 76% (95% CI [57.97; 94.41]) in Group 2. In the pooled Group 1&2, 75% (95% CI [61.58;88.42]) (30/40) and 81% (95% CI [68,46;93.6]) (30/37) of patients were cured in intention-to-treat and per-protocol, respectively. There were no significant differences observed in the success rates between Old World and New World CL (83.3% vs. 60%, p = 0.14). Prospective observations in Group 1 showed that adverse events were mainly pruritus (24%) and pain (18%) on lesions (all mild or moderate). No mucosal involvement was observed in either group.",
    "Discussion": "In this representative population of travelers who acquired CL either in the Old or New World, the 81% per-protocol cure rate of a self-applied aminoglycoside cream was similar to that observed in clinical trials."
