Schistosomiasis is a common disease in many lakeshore areas across Africa, especially in communities of a lower socio-economic status with inadequate access to clean water and hygienic sanitary facilities. The disease is caused by parasitic worms transmitted by fresh water snails in infested water bodies and can be lethal, if the infection and related chronic morbidities arenâ€™t timely treated. Available evidence indicates that people suffering from schistosomiasis experience stigmatization from community members and healthcare providers when seeking health care services. However, this has not been systematically examined. In the present study the EMIC-CSS questionnaire was adapted and validated according to the framework of Herdman and Fox-Rushby in order to investigate the extent of stigmatization due to schistosomiasis in Mwanza region, Tanzania, where the disease is highly endemic. The scale was successfully validated and the results indicate that schistosomiasis-related stigma is indeed common in communities living along the Lake Victoria in Mwanza region.
The findings of this study can improve knowledge and create awareness about the existence of community-related stigma towards persons infected with schistosomiasis and, as a result, can be used to contribute to the control and elimination of schistosomiasis in Tanzania.
