Naja atra bite is one of the most serious tropical and subtropical diseases, and the pathophysiological mechanism of injury caused by Naja atra bite is still not clear, meanwhile, large animal models of Naja atra bite are rarely reported. In this study, a Naja atra bite Bama miniature pig model was constructed and evaluated. In addition, 22 and 36 metabolites were found to be significantly altered in ESI+ and ESI- mode by untargeted metabolomics assay, respectively. More interestingly, 8 of them co-occurred in both ESI+ and ESI- modes. We quantified these 8 metabolites absolutely by targeted metabolomics and validated them in the serum of Naja atra bite patients, which showed the same trend as the untargeted metabolomics results. We also compared the differences in the levels of these 8 metabolites in the serum of the Naja atra bite patient group and the normal human group, we found decreased expression of inosine, proline and phenylalanine. Based on this, we compared the blood metabolic profiles with those of Bungarus multicinctus and Trimeresurus stejnegeri, and finally we confirmed that inosine, proline and phenylalanine are likely to be the key metabolites in Naja atra bite.
