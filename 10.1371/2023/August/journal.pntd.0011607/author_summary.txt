Iron metabolism is closely linked to hostâ€™s immunity and is involved in inflammatory and infectious processes. Iron is an important target for the host in its fight against pathogens. Meanwhile, iron is likewise a nutritional factor of pathogens and is closely associated to the survival and reproduction of T. gondii. The iron acquisition mechanisms of T. gondii may interfere with or disrupt host iron homeostasis and may induce ferroptosis in the host. Cerebral toxoplasmosis (CT) is a life-threatening infection caused by T. gondii. A comprehensive understanding of the iron metabolism status of hippocampal cells in the cerebral toxoplasmosis mouse model will help to understand the T. gondii iron acquisition pattern. To provide clues for subsequent studies on the specific mechanisms by which T. gondii regulates host iron metabolism and the development of relevant anti-Toxoplasma drugs. Here, our results showed that ferroptosis and inflammation appeared in the hippocampus after T. gondii infection. The DFP inhibits ferroptosis and attenuates inflammation, improving overall health and hippocampal pathological manifestations in infected mice. Our findings highlight that maintaining iron homeostasis and targeting ferroptosis may be a potential therapeutic approach for toxoplasmosis.
