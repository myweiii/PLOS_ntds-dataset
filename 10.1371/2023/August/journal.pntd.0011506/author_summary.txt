Human schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the intravascular trematode genus Schistosoma. The disease is contracted through contact with contaminated freshwater sources infested with snails, which serve as the intermediate host for the parasiteâ€™s larval form. Schistosoma mansoni causes the intestinal form of the disease and utilises Biomphalaria as its intermediate snail host. To better understand the prevalence of S. mansoni infection, molecular detection methods can be used to monitor the levels and patterns of infection within Biomphalaria populations. In this study, the authors examined the prevalence of S. mansoni infection within Biomphalaria snails collected from six sites along the Ugandan shorelines of Lake Albert and Lake Victoria from 2009 to 2010. The study revealed that infection was more prevalent at Lake Albert compared to Lake Victoria. Different species of Biomphalaria snails were found at each lake, with some species having a higher infection prevalence than others. The study also investigated the impact of seasonality on infection prevalence, with the wet seasons having an overall higher prevalence of infection compared to the dry seasons, although the difference was not statistically significant. This research enhances our understanding of S. mansoni infection patterns among African Biomphalaria snails.
