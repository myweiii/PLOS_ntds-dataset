Due to the complexity of intestinal environment and function, we are interested in the relationship between Trichinella spiralis and the gut microbiota. In our study, we reported the effects of T. spiralis infection on the gut microbiota of the host and gut microbiota intervention in T. spiralis expulsion by influencing the immune status of the host. On the one hand, we demonstrated that the infection of T. spiralis in the intestinal stage could lead to a decrease in the diversity of the gut microbiota and changes in community structure, and these results are conducive to T. spiralis invasion. On the other hand, the gut microbiota plays an important role in T. spiralis infection. The balance of gut microbiota is largely involved in the invasion and colonization of T. spiralis and the state of host immunity. Our findings further elucidated the relationship among host, parasite and gut microbiota, and provided new insights into the prevention and control of T. spiralis. In addition, the study also provides a new basis for the important role of the gut microbiota in pathogen infection and host homeostasis.
