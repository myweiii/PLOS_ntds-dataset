Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease which affects over 200 million people and there is only one licensed drug, praziquantel, currently available for treatment. In a search for new drugs to control schistosomiasis, we tested the anti-schistosome efficacy of a series of ruthenium compounds and found that a number of them were able to inhibit parasite eggs from hatching and kill adult worms and praziquantel-refractory juvenile worms in vitro. We demonstrated that the compounds inhibit schistosome acetylcholinesterase (the enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine), which could potentially result in paralysis of the parasite, likely due to uncontrolled neuromuscular function caused by acetylcholine excess. Moreover, we showed that drug-treated worms had a significantly reduced ability to uptake exogenous glucose and markedly depleted glycogen stores, presumably through inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase-mediated glucose scavenging pathway. Lastly, we found that two of the drugs—Rubb12-tri and Rubb7-tnl—when used to treat schistosome-infected mice, were able to reduce worm burdens and significantly affect the viability of parasite eggs in vivo, which would have a marked impact on disease transmission. We believe that these complexes are desirable drug lead scaffolds which could be used to develop effective and selective compounds to control and treat schistosomiasis and, potentially, other parasitic diseases.
