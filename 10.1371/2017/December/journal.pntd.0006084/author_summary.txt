Rabies represents a significant cause of fatality upon presentation of symptoms; however, pre- or timely post-exposure prophylaxis can provide complete protection to a population. The current reagents available for laboratory tests to determine the level of Rabies virus (RABV) neutralizing antibodies are not readily accessible in several regions, including Korea, and are associated with time and economic constraints owing to the import process. To resolve these issues, we developed a new monoclonal antibody with a fluorescent marker (16B8-Alexa) that targets the RABV phosphoprotein from a recent Korean isolate. We show its good detection ability, specificity, and sensitivity, demonstrating highly concordant results with those obtained with a standard commercial reagent using over 400 clinical samples applied to a World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic test. Thus, 16B8-Alexa shows great potential to resolve the current limitations in rabies diagnosis and monitoring in Korea, and is expected to serve as a valuable research tool for immunological studies on RABV.
