Giardia intestinalis is a major contributor to the enormous burden of diarrheal diseases with 280 million symptomatic human infections (giardiasis) per year, mainly in children. Nonetheless, there is poor insight into how Giardia causes disease; it is not invasive and very few virulence factors are known. Here we use proteomics, large-scale protein identification, to identify proteins released by the parasite and host cells when they interact in vitro. Our analyses show that both cell types respond to interaction by the release of specific proteins. These proteins affect the metabolism of host cells and parasites, and many are involved in the modification of hostâ€™s immune responses. The secreted parasite proteins bind to host cells and some are internalized, resulting in the modulation of immune-signaling proteins, cell cycle arrest and the induction of cell death. This study provides new insights into host-parasite interactions during giardiasis and this will be the basis for further studies of specific proteins that might explain disease induction and symptoms during giardiasis.
