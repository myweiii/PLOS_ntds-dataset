The Dipteran subfamily Phlebotominae includes the genera Lutzomyia and Phlebotomus among which several species are important vectors of parasitic and bacterial pathogens. The sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis is considered the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the New World. Based on the main component of the male sex-aggregation pheromone gland, different sex pheromone-producing populations (chemotypes) of L. longipalpis are recognized in Brazil. Given the importance of the sex-aggregation pheromones in the biology of this species complex, we present here the first attempt to study how pheromone accumulates in the glands over time and factors that might influence its release in the three most common chemotypes from Brazil. Our results demonstrated that pheromone first starts to accumulate a few hours post-eclosion (6â€“12 h) and this continues over 15 days. Pheromone release is a dynamic process which varies between the 3 chemotypes depending on biotic factors, such as light regime and presence/absence of conspecific females. This work provides valuable information, critical to our understanding of the behaviour and ecology of L. longipalpis sand flies and which will contribute to investigations to improve field-based pheromone control and monitoring of L. longipalpis sand flies.
