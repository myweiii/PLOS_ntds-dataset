The consequences of first introductions of mosquito-borne viruses into previously unaffected areas depend on environmental factors, the availability of susceptible hosts and local vector populations. We have previously demonstrated that sheep breeds native to the Netherlands are highly susceptible to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne virus that causes severe outbreaks among domesticated ruminants and humans in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. To gain further insight into the risk of a future RVFV introduction into the Netherlands, we have now investigated the vector competence of Cx. pipiens, the most abundant mosquito species in the country. Vector competence was first determined after artificial blood feeding and subsequently after feeding on viremic lambs. The results from artificial feeding experiments suggested that indigenous Cx. pipiens mosquitoes are competent vectors. The vector competence of Cx. pipiens was confirmed after feeding on viremic lambs. Transmission from lambs to mosquitoes was found to be very efficient, although largely confined to peak viremia. The localized inflammatory response resulting from mosquito bites was associated with enhanced virus replication in the skin.
