Chagas disease is a parasitic disease caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi. The infection may result in gastrointestinal manifestations and cardiomyopathy. Benznidazole, the current treatment, has limited efficacy and often leads to serious side effects. Aiming to develop new treatments, our group has identified new inhibitors that block the synthesis of parasitic lipids, resulting in parasite death. In this work, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of two of these compounds, 9 and 12, in mouse models of T. cruzi infection. Both compounds were well-tolerated by animals throughout the 28-day administration. In acutely infected mice, the compounds drastically reduced bloodstream parasites and increased survival. When treatment was initiated during the chronic phase, parasitemia dropped to background levels and remained undetectable for 4 weeks after drug withdrawal; parasites were re-activated by chemically-induced immunosuppression. Thus, the experimental compounds tested in these studies had an acceptable safety profile, achieved a marked reduction in parasite load and prevented heart injury due to inflammation, even in the absence of sterile cure. We conclude that the development of non-toxic medications capable of slowing the progression of cardiomyopathy is a valuable treatment option for Chagas disease patients because it could enhance the quality of life.
