The few bug species of Triatominae that have become domesticated are the most important vectors of human Trypanosoma cruzi infection, which causes Chagas disease. Evolutionary theory predicts that the fitness of hematophagous species closely adapted to human habitations should increase with feeding on human hosts and insect body length (L). Testing these hypotheses is important for a better understanding of triatomine population dynamics, identifying key productive habitats, modeling parasite transmission and designing innovative vector control strategies. This study is the first to describe the distributions of L and total individual bloodmeal contents (BMC) of triatomines over bug stages and habitats in rural villages where Chagas disease is endemic, and provides a direct link between individual BMC and female fecundity, host-feeding choices and L. L positively and significantly correlated with other body-size surrogates and was modified by habitat and host associations. Feeding on humans was associated with larger BMC and maximal female fecundity in domestic triatomine populations. Human- and chicken-fed bugs had significantly larger BMC than bugs fed on other hosts. Goat-fed bugs ranked last over all habitats, in agreement with other evidence. This study demonstrates that identifiable habitat-host associations provide nearly optimal resources and conditions for T. infestans.
