Cobra envenomation is a public health issue in Southeast Asia. Currently, antivenom therapy is the standard treatment for snakebite. However, antivenoms are not available in many rural countries and communities or have only limited effectiveness. Taiwan has wealth of experience in producing antivenoms, including the bivalent freeze-dried neurotoxic antivenom (FNAV), which is raised against venom proteins from Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra. Our results showed that FNAV effectively neutralized the lethality of Naja kaouthia(Thailand) and Naja siamensis (Thailand) venoms, but not Ophiophagus hannah (Indonesia) venom, in an animal model. We further characterized the venom proteome profiles of the four cobras and identified three abundant proteins—neurotoxin, cytotoxin and phospholipase A2—in the venom of N. atra, N. kaouthia and N. siamensisas the major antigens recognized by FNAV. In contrast, we found that β-cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2, common toxin proteins in all king cobra venom samples, are weakly or not recognized by FNAV. Our data provide evidence suggesting the potential use of Taiwan’s FNAV to treat envenomation by other cobra species (N. kaouthia and N. siamensis) in Southeast Asia. Moreover, our findings support the previous recommendation and current experimental approach that major cobra toxins are used as antigens to generate more efficient antivenoms than those currently available.
