Volunteer community drug distributors play an important role in preventing and treating many neglected tropical diseases (NTD) through their participation in mass drug administration (MDA) programs for lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), onchocerciasis (river blindness), soil transmitted helminths (intestinal worms), trachoma and schistosomiasis (snail fever). Their role is to carry out a census, inform and educate community members, distribute medication, fill out reports and monitor for adverse events. These volunteers work tirelessly in their communities with minimal incentives. Increasingly, as the 2020 elimination goals for NTDs approach, there is concern that we need to better motivate these individuals and prevent attrition. In order to better understand what motivates volunteer community drug distributors, a review of the literature was carried out. Recurring themes in the literature included monetary and material incentives, intrinsic motivation, gender, cost to participate, and health systems and community support. Of these, community support and the health system were found to be particularly impactful. Our results show that better community engagement and integration into the health system will help to maximize retention of this volunteer workforce.
