Schistosomiasis is a debilitating disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide, mainly in developing countries. Treatment for schistosomiasis is straightforward and involves treating all school-age children, and sometimes also adults, in areas where schistosomiasis is known to occur. However, detecting intestinal schistosomiasis (Schistosoma mansoni) using Kato-Katz, the most common technique, can fail to detect infection when it is present as Kato-Katz relies on finding eggs within a small stool sample. A new field diagnostic, CCA, is promising as it is simple to use and seems to detect more infections that Kato-Katz. However, assessing the performance of CCA is difficult as we cannot be certain whether or not those positive by CCA but negative by Kato-Katz are truly infected. Additionally, CCA can often return a trace result between negative and positive which is difficult to interpret. We assess the performance of Kato-Katz and CCA in both Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda. We showed that CCA did indeed detect more infections than Kato-Katz, and that CCA accurately estimated the proportion of people truly infected in the population, when trace readings were considered positive. CCA is consequently an important and valuable tool in the fight against schistosomiasis.
