    "Background": "The development of new diagnostics is an important tool in the fight against disease. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of tests in the absence of a gold standard. The main field diagnostic for Schistosoma mansoni infection, Kato-Katz (KK), is not very sensitive at low infection intensities. A point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) test has been shown to be more sensitive than KK. However, CCA can return an ambiguous \u2018trace\u2019 result between \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019, and much debate has focused on interpretation of traces results.",
    "Methodology/Principle findings": "We show how LCA can be extended to include ambiguous trace results and analyse S. mansoni studies from both C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (CdI) and Uganda. We compare the diagnostic performance of KK and CCA and the observed results by each test to the estimated infection prevalence in the population.",
    "Conclusions": "Incorporation of ambiguous results into an LCA enables the effect of different treatment thresholds to be directly assessed and is applicable in many fields. Our results showed that CCA with trace as positive most accurately estimated infection prevalence."
