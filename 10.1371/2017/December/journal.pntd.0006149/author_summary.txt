Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus that causes haemorrhagic fever with fatalities in humans. Clinical disease has been described in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Turkey and more recently Greece, India and Spain. In the absence of specific anti-virals and vaccines, supportive therapy is the method of treatment. Specific T cell epitopes have yet to be identified for CCHFV following infection and although antibody responses are detectable in survivors, antibody production does not always correlate with viral clearance, implying that innate and T cell immunity likely also play an important role. To further understand the role of T lymphocytes in the immune response to CCHFV infection, we aimed to determine whether memory T cell responses could be identified in survivors of CCHFV infection and to identify the viral proteins on which the T cell epitopes are located. T cell responses to CCHFV peptides were detected in this study population up to 13 years after acute CCHFV infection and provides confirmation of long-lived CD8+ T cell responses. The longevity of the responses points towards memory T cells playing an important role and implies that effective long term protection from infection may be achieved through vaccination.
