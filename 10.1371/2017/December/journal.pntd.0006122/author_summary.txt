Schistosomes are a parasite of global importance, affecting over 200 million people worldwide, while also infecting livestock and wildlife. Despite decades of research on schistosomiasis in humans, little is known about what drives patterns of infection in untreated naturally occurring populations. We took advantage of a study in African buffalo to understand how geography, nutrition, immunity and coinfection drive schistosome acquisition and loss. The most striking outcome of our study was that schistosome burden varied seasonally within an individual, with some hosts able to completely clear infection, and others unable to do so. The ability of a buffalo to clear infection was affected by immune response and co-infection with other gastrointestinal parasites while host immunity and coinfection were not important in determining whether a buffalo became infected. These outcomes should be taken into consideration when designing control programs for human schistosomiasis.
