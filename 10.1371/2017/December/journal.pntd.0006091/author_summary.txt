Clinical presentations of dengue fever (DF) are diverse and non-specific and often have unpredictable progression and outcomes. The patients in the 2015 dengue epidemics in Taiwan were predominantly much older than in other countries in Southeast Asia. However, limited data are available in Taiwan on dengue patients with adverse prognoses who were admitted to ICU or on those with fatal complications. All suspected dengue cases were reported to the Dengue Disease Reporting System in Taiwan. We examined patients who had laboratory-confirmed dengue in Tainan during the 2015 dengue outbreak and analyzed secondary data from the reporting system. Of these patients, 3.7% were admitted to ICU, and 0.8% died. Patients who received adverse prognoses were generally of older age, had a critical presentation at the time of reporting, and experienced a rapid progress of the disease, highlighting that people with severe and non-specific signs and symptoms at the time of reporting were at a higher risk of ICU admission and mortality.
