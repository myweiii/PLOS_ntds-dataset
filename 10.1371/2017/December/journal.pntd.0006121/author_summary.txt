Some leprosy patients develop reactions which cause a significant morbidity and mortality in leprosy patients. There are two types of leprosy reactions, type 1 and type 2 reactions. Type 2 or Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune-mediated inflammatory complication of leprosy which occurs in lepromatous and borderline lepromatous leprosy patients. The exact cause of ENL is unknown. Immune-complexes and T-cells are suggested as the aetiology of ENL. However, the contribution of B-cells in ENL reactions has never been addressed. In the present study we described the role of B-cell subsets in ENL reaction and compared with non reactional LL patient controls before, during and after corticosteroids treatment. We found increased antigen experienced and activated B-cells in untreated ENL patients compared to those without the reaction (LL patients). This implies that B-cells are associated with ENL pathology. Therefore, the finding provides a ground for future research targeting B-cells to develop effective drug for ENL treatment.
