‘‘Cost-effectiveness analysis of diarrhoea management approaches in Nigeria: a decision analytical model” was an original research carried out due to the high prevalence and mortality rate due to diarrhoea in Nigeria. The study aims to determine which treatment approach for diarrhoea would be cost-effective for Nigerians to implement due to limited resources available. Rotavirus vaccine plus integrated management of childhood illness for diarrhoea approach (rotavirus vaccine + IMCI) was the most cost-effective treatment approach.
