Filariosis is a disease group affecting humans and animals, caused by nematode parasites of the family Onchocercidae, superfamily Filarioidea. These parasites can be transmitted, essentially, by mosquitoes during blood meals of infected female specimens. Screening vectors for these filariae currently relies on time- and resource-consuming methods such as dissection and polymerase chain reaction-based methods. Here, we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to assess whether this tool can detect changes in the protein profiles of Aedes aegypti infected with filarioid helminths compared to those uninfected by testing different parts of mosquitoes. First a reference mass spectra database from Ae. aegypti infected or not infected by filariae was created using MS from 47 specimen compartments. Then we tested the remaining mass spectra (350 x 4) in a blind validation test. Regardless of filariae species, the best correct classification rate was obtained from the thorax-head part with a specificity of 94.1% and sensitivity of 86.6, 71.4 and 68.7% for non-infected and D. immitis, B. malayi and B. pahangi infected mosquitoes respectively. The results indicated that MALDI-TOF MS is potentially able to screen Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as being non-infected or filariae-infected. Furthermore, complementary works using other mosquito species infected with different filarioids are needed to reinforce these preliminary results prior to apply this tool on field samples.
