Trachoma is a disease in which the conjunctiva of the eye is repeatedly infected by the intracellular organism Chlamydia trachomatis. This can cause scarring of the eyelid’s inner surface, which in turn can cause the eyelashes to turn inwards, scratching the eye and leading to blindness. This scarring process is associated with age and usually does not present until adulthood. However, in communities with very high trachoma rates, it has also been reported in children. There are scant data addressing the presence and nature of such scarring among children in areas where elimination efforts have reduced trachoma from high to low prevalence. In this study, we found that even though interventions in Kongwa, Tanzania, have successfully reduced trachoma levels in recent years, 1–9 year-olds can still be found with eyelid scarring. However, this scarring is rare and generally mild. Eyelid scarring from trachoma is known to increase with age, but interestingly, that was not seen in this cohort. This suggests that not only have interventions reduced eyelid scarring in children to low levels, but that this protective affect may be sustained into adolescence and adulthood.
