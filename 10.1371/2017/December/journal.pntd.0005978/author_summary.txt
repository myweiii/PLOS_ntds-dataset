Phlebotomine sandflies are vectors of phleboviruses that cause sandfly fever or meningitis with significant implications for public health. Although several strains of these viruses had been isolated in Iran in the late 1970's, there was no recent data about the present situation at the outset of this study. Entomological investigations performed in 2009 and 2011 in Iran collected 4,770 sandflies from 10 different regions. A phlebovirus, provisionally named Dashli virus (DASHV), was isolated / detected in two pools. DASHV strain was isolated in cell culture and complete genome sequence was determined. Sequence analysis indicated that (i) DASHV is most closely related to the Iranian isolates of Sandfly fever Sicilian virus [SFSV], a virus that is known to cause self-resolutive incapacitating febrile illness in humans, (ii) there is a common ancestor to DASHV and all other variants of SFSV isolated in Italy, India, Turkey, and Cyprus (lineage I), (iii) DASHV is more distantly related with Corfou and Toros viruses (lineage II) although common ancestry is supported with 100% bootstrap, (iii) lineage I can be subdivided into sublineage Ia including all SFSV strains, whereas Iranian viruses are most closely related and should be individualized as DASHV (sublineage Ib). Although discovered first in the 1940's, SFSV is still listed as "tentative species" by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses. Based on the results described in this study, we propose to approve Sandfly fever Sicilian virus species. Owing that most of these viruses have been identified in human patients with febrile illness, DASHV should be considered as a potential human pathogen in Iran.
