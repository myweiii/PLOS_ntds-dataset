Senegal is one of the many African countries infested by tsetse flies responsible for the transmission of trypanosomes to humans and animals, causing health and economic losses. In the Niayes area, located in the west of Senegal, only one tsetse species, Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank (Diptera: Glossinidae) is present, which is targeted by an elimination effort including the sterile insect technique (SIT). The quality of the strain used to implement any SIT effort is instrumental for its success. Here we compared the competitiveness and survival of irradiated males of two strains (BKF and SEN) released in the Parc de Hann, to assess their usefulness in eradicating this isolated population, located within the capital city, Dakar. We observed that the mating competitiveness of the SEN males was significantly lower as compared with that of the BKF males. Based on this study, we concluded that the BKF strain will remain the main strain to be used in the elimination programme in the Niayes.
