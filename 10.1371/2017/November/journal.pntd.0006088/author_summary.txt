Each year, hundreds of millions of people worldwide are infected with intestinal worms spread by contaminated soil, also known as soil transmitted helminths (STHs). These worms are most common in tropical climates in areas lacking good hygiene and sanitation, and negatively impact child development, quality of life, and economic wellbeing. Reuse of human excreta for fertilizer is a common practice in many low to middle income countries because farmers require a low cost source of nutrients to grow food crops eaten by people and animals. Excreta can contain microbes, such as STHs, that cause disease in people; however, composting is a known method of killing STHs. Therefore, our goal was to determine if Vietnamese rice farmers involved in this practice are at higher risk of STH infection, and to calculate the amount of money saved by farmers composting for different lengths of time, and supplementing with various commercial fertilizers. We suggest that farmers compost excreta for six months to reduce disease exposure and optimize household savings. Optimizing practices to improve food production and protect farmer health is critical for poverty alleviation in low to middle income countries.
