    "Background": "Histone deacetylase 8 from Schistosoma mansoni (SmHDAC8) is essential to parasite growth and development within the mammalian host and is under investigation as a target for the development of selective inhibitors as novel schistosomicidal drugs. Although some protein substrates and protein partners of human HDAC8 have been characterized, notably indicating a role in the function of the cohesin complex, nothing is known of the partners and biological function of SmHDAC8.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We therefore employed two strategies to characterize the SmHDAC8 interactome. We first used SmHDAC8 as a bait protein in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening of an S. mansoni cDNA library. This allowed the identification of 49 different sequences encoding proteins. We next performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments on parasite extracts with an anti-SmHDAC8 antibody. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis allowed the identification of 160 different proteins.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "SmHDAC8 partners are involved in about 40 different processes, included expected functions such as the cohesin complex, cytoskeleton organization, transcriptional and translational regulation, metabolism, DNA repair, the cell cycle, protein dephosphorylation, proteolysis, protein transport, but also some proteasome and ribosome components were detected. Our results show that SmHDAC8 is a versatile deacetylase, potentially involved in both cytosolic and nuclear processes."
