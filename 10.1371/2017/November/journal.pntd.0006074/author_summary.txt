Multiple studies have contributed to the association between Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) infestation and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in past years. However, studies on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of C. sinensis lag behind those of other parasitic diseases. The excretory/secretory products of C. sinensis (CsESPs) are pathogenic, as these products promote cell proliferation, suppress cell apoptosis and stimulate inflammation. Csseverin, a component of CsESPs, inhibited the apoptosis of the human HCC cell line PLC in our previous study. The present study illustrated that Csseverin conferred human HCC cells protection from apoptosis via an intrinsic pathway (mitochondrial-mediated) triggered by the inactivation of membranous Ca2+ channels.
