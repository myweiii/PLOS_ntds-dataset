The present ecological study is aimed at characterizing introduction and spread of dengue in the state of Acre, located in Brazil’s north region. We use sociodemographic and entomological data from the year 2000, when the first case was registered in Acre, up to 2015, when it was already endemic in most of the state. We use a methodological framework based on well-established concepts in malaria literature, namely vulnerability and receptivity, to assess dengue introduction and propagation in the study area. We make use of effective reproduction number as an empirical indicator of dengue outbreak spatiotemporal patterns, as well as complex network theory concepts applied to human mobility and transport infrastructure changes to address dengue importation probability from other Brazilian states and its circulation within Acrean municipalities. On the one hand, we show that the increase of airline passengers, coupled with observed dengue incidence in Brazil, has steadily increased Acre’s vulnerability to dengue introduction, while transport infrastructure development has facilitated its spread within the state. On the other hand, socio-demographic changes aimed at urbanization and economic development have increased receptivity to its main vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The combination of those two factors ultimately leads to the establishment of the virus in Acre.
