The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii has been previously associated with an increased risk of serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. However, this association has been found in some studies and not others. We examined whether the differences among previous studies might be explained by the timing of patient evaluation and testing. We found that individuals who were evaluated soon after the onset of psychosis had increased odds of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii as evidenced by the measurement of antibodies in their blood. However. we did not find an increased rate of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii in individuals who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder but who did not have recent onset psychosis. Our findings are consistent with Toxoplasma exposure occurring around the time of onset of psychiatric symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. Our findings might lead to the evaluation of new methods for the early treatment of schizophrenia in some individuals.
