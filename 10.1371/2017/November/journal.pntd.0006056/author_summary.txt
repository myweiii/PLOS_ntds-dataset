Different species of parasitic worms release microRNAs, small non-coding RNA molecules, some of which are known to interact with host genes to alter the immune response. We characterized a cluster of four microRNAs from Haemonchus contortus, an important parasitic nematode of livestock. The miRNA cluster appeared to be present only in nematode worms that inhabit the intestinal tract and members of the cluster could be detected in the excretory-secretory products of adult H. contortus. Some of these miRNAs were also detected from the site of infection within the sheep host and from the draining lymph node suggesting that they may be released in vivo as well as in vitro. Analysis of excretory-secretory products released from adult worms and L4 larval stages demonstrated that specific miRNAs were contained within EV. These findings support a role for secreted miRNAs in the host-parasite relationship.
