River blindness is caused by a very tiny, thread-like worm. The disease is better controlled when affected communities are included in the planning and carrying out of distribution of Ivermectin used to treat the disease. For a community to be able to prevent people from getting this disease, members must take Ivermectin once or twice a year, continuously for about 20 years. Hence, the organization in charge of controlling river blindness (African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control–APOC) decided that when a control programme is started in a community, the community must be involved and assisted to take full charge of the programme so that within 12 years the community can sustain the distribution of Ivermectin for as long as necessary. This community directed strategy prevented river blindness in many communities. However, after 10–12 years of implementation, studies found that river blindness largely persists in communities in three drainage basins in South West Region of Cameroon. This paper discussed the operational challenges that the programme may have faced in these areas.
