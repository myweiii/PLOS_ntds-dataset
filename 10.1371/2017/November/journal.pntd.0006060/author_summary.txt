This work was conducted in coastal Guinea, the last focus in Western Africa where the transmission of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is still very active. The Guinean government and his partners are conducting HAT control activities to reduce the burden of this neglected tropical disease and, as set-up by WHO, to eliminate it as a public health problem by 2020. Unfortunately, control efforts were deeply impaired during the Ebola outbreak that stroke the country in 2014â€“15. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of this unprecedented outbreak on HAT screening and caring activities. A major impact was the interruption of all active screening activities which aim, in addition of detecting and treating patients, is to clear the human reservoir of parasite and decrease transmission. Passive surveillance and diagnosis were also severely affected due to the fear of the population to come to the endemic district confirmation and treatment facilities and to the progressive banning of using rapid test in peripheral health structures, as well as the requisition of healthcare workers and facilities for the fight against Ebola. As a consequence, only 59 HAT patients were diagnosed and treated during the Ebola outbreak (from January 2014 to October 2015) as compared to 154 before the outbreak (from February 2012 to December 2013). This potentially high number of undiagnosed human reservoir of trypanosomes may have contributed in turn to increase transmission levels. A rapid revival of HAT control activities in Guinea is thus vital in order to stay in line with the 2020 elimination goal and to avoid possible bursts of the disease.
