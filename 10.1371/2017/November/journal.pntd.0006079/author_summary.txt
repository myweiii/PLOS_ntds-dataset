In Indonesia, veterinary diagnostic laboratories conduct tests for rabies on brain samples from animals suspected of being infected with rabies virus. National laboratories use internationally recommended tests for rabies virus that require expensive materials and equipment. Remote and smaller Provincial laboratories use a simpler older-generation chemical stain test that is less costly to perform but is also highly inaccurate resulting in many rabies-infected brains returning false negative test results. Brain samples that give negative results at a Provincial laboratory are then transported to a National laboratory for retesting to confirm the diagnosis. This results in additional costs and time delays and creates the need for a more effective, lower cost rabies test that Provincial laboratories can effectively use. This paper describes the development of one such test that is of comparable accuracy to the internationally recommended test for detecting rabies in brain and does not require expensive equipment to perform.
