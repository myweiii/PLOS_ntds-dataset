The West Nile virus (WNV) can cause severe neurological diseases including meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Differences in WNV genetics could play a role in the frequency of neurological symptoms from an infection. For the first time, we observed how geographically similar but genetically distinct lineages grow in cellular environments that agree with the transmission chain of West Nile virusâ€”vertebrate-arthropod-vertebrate. We were able to connect our in vitro and in vivo results with relevant epidemiological and molecular data. Our findings highlight the existence of West African lineages with higher virulence and replicative efficiency in vitro and in vivo compared to lineages similar to circulating strains in the United States and Europe. Our investigation of four West African lineages of West Nile virus will help us better understand the biology of the virus and assess future epidemiological threats.
