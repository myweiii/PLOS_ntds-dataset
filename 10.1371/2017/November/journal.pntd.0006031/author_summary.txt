This is the first cluster randomized controlled trial providing evidence on the effect of applying residual insecticide treatment and deploying insecticide treated curtains on clinical dengue case incidence. In a context of intensive routine control activities, low Aedes infestation and moderate transmission, we did not observe an entomological nor epidemiological effect of these interventions. Besides the epidemiological context, we hypothesized two factors to explain our results: the counteracting effect of multiple insecticides applied in the same place at the same time and the importance of human mobility in dengue transmission dynamics. The specific impact of residual insecticide treatment and insecticide treated curtains on dengue transmission should be unambiguously demonstrated in settings with more intense arbovirus transmission and/or with less intensive routine control measures in place, before making recommendations for their implementation in local vector control programs in such contexts.
