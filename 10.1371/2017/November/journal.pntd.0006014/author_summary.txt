In the present study, we report the evidence of various orthobunyaviruses of medical importance in domestic and wild animals of the Pantanal, a large floodplain located in West-Central Brazil. Although various other arboviruses as flaviviruses and alphaviruses have been reported in the region, orthobunyaviruses are not commonly investigated in Pantanal. Positive results for eight orthobunyaviruses, including Maguari, Xingu, Apeu, Guaroa, Murutucu, Oriboca, Oropouche and Nepuyo viruses were detected in equines, sheep and caimans in the region. The findings reported here suggest the Pantanal as a region of great orthobunyavirus diversity and ratify the Pantanal as hotspot for arbovirus studies in South America.
