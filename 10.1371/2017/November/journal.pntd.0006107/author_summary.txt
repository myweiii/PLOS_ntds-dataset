Rickettsial infections including scrub typhus and Q fever are not widely recognised in Bhutan although the country is situated in an endemic Asian region. With two recorded outbreaks, scrub typhus is known to occur but other rickettsial infections and Q fever have not been recorded. In this first seroprevalence study of rickettsial infections, an overall seroprevalence of 49% was detected against rickettsioses amongst 864 participants. Seroprevalence was highest against scrub typhus group (STG) (22.6%) followed by spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsia (15.7%), Q fever (QF) (6.9%) and typhus group (TG) rickettsia (3.5%). Evidence of exposure to multiple agents were also noted; the commonest being dual exposure to STG and SFG at 5%. A personâ€™s likelihood of exposure to STG and SFG significantly increased with age and farmers were twice as likely to have evidence of STG exposure as other occupations. Trongsa district in central Bhutan appeared to be a hotspot for STG exposure. People living at altitudes above 2000 meters were relatively protected from STG infections but this was not observed for SFG, TG and QF exposure. The findings from this study may direct future research on rickettsioses in Bhutan. These neglected tropical diseases warrant specific public health interventions in Bhutan.
