Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease that affects more than 2 million people worldwide. The identification of putative Leishmania vectors is an important step towards the design of better control strategies and estimating the risk of transmission in endemic areas. In this paper the authors explored the distribution of sand flies and identified potential vectors in a largely unexplored setting in the Southeastern Peruvian Amazon Basin. Three new sand fly species Lutzomyia naiffi, Lu. dereuri and Lu. flabellata are reported for Peru. In addition, they found fourteen sand fly species naturally infected with Leishmania that comprised seven new reports for Peru and one for the Americas. This information will serve as a baseline for future surveillance and intervention studies in this highly endemic area.
