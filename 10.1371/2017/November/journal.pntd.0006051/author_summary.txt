Aiming to understand the epidemiology and changing patterns of the Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A within a single healthcare facility in Kathmandu, we retrospectively analysed 23 years of microbiological blood culture data. From 224,741 blood cultures performed, 30,353 were confirmed to be positive for pathogenic bacteria, of which Salmonella enterica accounted for 65.4% (19,857/30,353) of all the bacteria positive blood cultures. S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A were the dominant serovars, constituting 68.5% (13,592/19,857) and 30.5% (6,057/19,857) of all isolated Salmonellae. We observed that S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A remained the leading cause of bacterial febrile illness since the 1990s. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance is a major public health challenge, and resistance against the antimicrobials most commonly used for treating enteric fever has developed over the last two decades. In this analysis we were able to document a decrease in the number of Salmonella-positive cultures from 2002 to 2014 and an increase in the proportion of S. Paratyphi A in all Salmonella-positive cultures between 1992 and 2014. Concurrently, we also observed a decrease in MDR for S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi and a recent increase in fluoroquinolone non-susceptibility in both serovars.
