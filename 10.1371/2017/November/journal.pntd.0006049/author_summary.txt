In spite of its old discovery, more than one hundred years ago, Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas’ disease, is still prevalent in the world, infecting more than 6 million people mostly in Latin America, where this illness is endemic. Only two approved drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, are currently used for the treatment of Chagas’ disease. Although efficient for the acute phase, they are poorly effective in the chronic period of the disease and they cause many undesirable side effects. There is an urgent need for therapeutic alternatives. To this end, identifying and validating novel molecular targets is critically relevant. This study describes the effect of different inhibitors on the T. cruzi autophagic pathway, a process required for parasite differentiation. Herein, we demonstrate that the regulation of parasite autophagy exhibits similarities and differences with host cell autophagy. Our study provides new insights that could be used to avoid T. cruzi cycle progression in both insect and mammalian hosts.
