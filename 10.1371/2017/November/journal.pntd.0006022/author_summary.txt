Worldwide, two billion people are estimated to be infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). These infections are primarily found in low resource settings and can result in cognitive impairment and growth stunting in children. The current control method is by chemotherapy, usually during large-scale mass drug administrations (MDA); however, this does not prevent re-infection, which can occur rapidly after treatment. The currently used diagnostics lack sensitivity in low intensity infections, resulting in underreporting of STH prevalence. In order to evaluate new control programs aimed at preventing re-infection and decreasing environmental prevalence of STH, more sensitive diagnostics are required. In this study we have shown that qPCR is far more sensitive than the traditionally used Kato-Katz (KK) microscopic technique, suggesting a role for qPCR in assessing control interventions.
