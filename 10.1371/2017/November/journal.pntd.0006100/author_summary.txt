Poverty is a condition that increases disease risks and presents severe health challenges. The negative impact of poverty on health is well understood, but much less is known about how people living in poor conditions themselves perceive health challenges and how they try to overcome these challenges. We studied a group of Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC) plantation workers, living in housing provided by the company, known as camps. Living conditions in plantation camps are characterised by small and very basic housing, shared toilet facilities and overall poor sanitation. In the camps, water sources were public taps found in strategic areas. During water cuts, camp dwellers used streams as their water sources. Water was treated at CDC management level. We questioned 237 labourers (or dependants) on matters related to their health. Malaria, cholera and diarrhoea were reported as the main diseases that they associated with poverty. Our results also show that the labourers associated poverty primarily with the poor state of their living conditions rather than with not having money. Even though CDC offered free healthcare, camp dwellers relied on self-treatment and unofficial medication, especially for malaria for which almost 90% of the workers did not use the free services. Therefore, for interventions to be successful, they should include peopleâ€™s perceptions and focus on improving hygiene conditions.
