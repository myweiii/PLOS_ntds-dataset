Mycolactone is a complex macrolidic polyketide produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, with cytotoxic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Peripheral nerve destruction and activation of type 2 angiotensin II receptors on sensory neurons have been proposed to mediate bacteria-induced hypoesthesia in infected skin. In addition, mycolactone was recently shown to block the co-translational translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum in host cells, leading to defective inflammatory responses. Here we examined if this last mechanism may also contribute to inhibit neuro-inflammation and particularly in the context of neuropathic pain. Using a representative panel of primary cells from the central and peripheral nervous systems, we found that indeed, mycolactone potently inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Notably, mycolactone prevented the polarization and pro-inflammatory functions of cortical microglia, which are critical inducers of neuroinflammation. Consistent with our in vitro findings, mycolactone had potent anti-inflammatory effects on the spinal cord of rats injected in the spinal canal, with no apparent side effects. Our data show that mycolactone suppresses inflammatory responses in the nervous system similarly as in the immune system, suggesting that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may, at least partially, be explained by its anti-inflammatory properties.
