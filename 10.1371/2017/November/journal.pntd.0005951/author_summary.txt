Although vaccination is accepted as a potentially effective approach to prevent leishmaniasis, to date there is no vaccine available for human disease. The research on the topic is therefore extremely important, and the design and testing of new vaccine approaches, as well as non-traditional immunization schemes continues to be as relevant as before. This study proposes an innovative vaccine approach for human visceral leishmaniasis, not only due to its multi-antigen nature which contemplates both parasite and vector derived proteins, but also because it explores the possibility of the use of Influenza virosomes as antigen-delivery vehicles. A strong TLR-4 agonist completes the vaccine formulation. Here we show the rationale-behind this vaccine approach, the safety of all the vaccine components in our in vivo context, and immunogenicity studies of the optimized vaccine candidate in mice that explored the contribution of the virosome to the antigen-elicited immune responses. Additionally, we tested an unusual immunization scheme that potentiated the final vaccine-elicited immune responses. This prime-boost immunization approach gives relevance to the use of both parasite and vector derived antigens together as an anti-Leishmania vaccine, and proposes a new strategy for vaccination in endemic areas, where people are constantly exposed to sand fly bites.
