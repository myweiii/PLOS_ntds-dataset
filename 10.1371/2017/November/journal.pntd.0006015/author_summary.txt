American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) caused by Leishmania braziliensis is characterized by lesions to the skin and/or mucosal surfaces of the oropharynx. It is widely distributed in endemic regions of northeast Brazil and has been difficult to control. Three common clinical forms of L. braziliensis infections are localized skin ulcers called cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) affecting mucosal surfaces, and disseminated leishmaniasis (DL), a recently described form with widespread skin lesions. Using GPS and epidemiologic data we explored the incidence and pattern of spread of ATL in the highly endemic region of Corte de Pedra, Brazil between 1992 and 2011. Geographic clusters of CL and DL cases were observed. In contrast, there was a sporadic non-clustered pattern of ML cases in the study area. The numbers of new cases of CL and DL presented similar fluctuation during the study period, but ML incidences were never correlated to those of CL and DL. We conclude that all forms of ATL actively spread within affected foci, but in different patterns. CL and DL cases occur in clusters suggesting active spread of causative parasite strains, whereas ML cases occurred in a sporadic pattern suggesting it may emerge due to factors such as host immunity or environmental conditions.
