Podoconiosis is an example of a lifestyle-related disease that develops after childhood and affects millions of people with little experience of preventive behaviour. It is caused by prolonged barefoot exposure to irritant mineral particles, accompanied by inherited susceptibility. Children with a family history of podoconiosis are highly vulnerable to the disease. Several studies have underscored the importance of studying health beliefs in children for the early control of diseases that arise from risky behaviour and habits established in childhood, which continue into adulthood. This study attempted to explore the health beliefs of school-age children in podoconiosis affected families. The forms of health beliefs addressed in the present study were knowledge of podoconiosis risk factors and perceptions of severity of and susceptibility to the disease, benefits of and barriers to engaging in preventive actions such as footwear use and feet hygiene, and self-efficacy to perform preventive actions regardless of perceived barriers. Various forms of misconceptions and inaccurate risk perceptions were recorded. Participant children also reported several barriers that limited their engagement in preventive actions and low confidence to overcome them. These findings imply that school-age children at high risk of podoconiosis might benefit from an intervention that improves their knowledge about podoconiosis and enhances their self-efficacy to sustainably perform preventive behaviours.
