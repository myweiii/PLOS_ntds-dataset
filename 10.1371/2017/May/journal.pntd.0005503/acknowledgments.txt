The authors give special acknowledgement to the cultural oversight and advice from the Ngumbin Reference Group, David Lines, and Emma Baunach at Katherine West Health Board Aboriginal Corporation, whose work provided a strong foundation for trachoma health promotion in Australia. This study was made possible due to the dedicated support of Cate Coffey, Heather Wilson and trachoma nurses at the Centre for Disease Control, Northern Territory Department of Health. The assistance of individuals and organisations did not include financial support for the research project.
