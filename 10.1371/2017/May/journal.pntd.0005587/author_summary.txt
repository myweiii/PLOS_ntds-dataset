Melioidosis is a high-mortality infectious disease in Southeast Asia and northern Australia caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is a flagellated, rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium. Understanding protective host immune responses to melioidosis is fundamental for effective vaccine development. A previous study demonstrated a strong relationship between a TLR5 stop codon polymorphism that encodes a truncated receptor for bacterial flagellin and protection against death from melioidosis. In this study, we confirmed the relationship of this genetic variant with survival from acute melioidosis in adult patients in northeast Thailand, and identified an association with a lower rate of bacteremia. We also demonstrated that this variant was associated with an increase in peripheral lymphocyte count, but we did not find an association with B. pseudomallei-specific lymphocyte responses; i.e., IFN-γ secreted T cell response, indirect haemagglutination titers or anti-flagellin IgG antibodies. In addition, patients with the TLR5 variant have significantly lower levels of IL-10 and TNF-α cytokines in plasma. Our findings further the understanding of the role of TLR5 in protective host immune responses against fatal melioidosis, and inform efforts to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics for melioidosis.
