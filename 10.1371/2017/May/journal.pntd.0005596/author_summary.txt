Mansonella perstans is a widespread human filarial parasite in Africa responsible for pleural and peritoneal cavity filariasis. Compared to other filarial parasites such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Loa loa, the biology of M. perstans is poorly known. The blood-feeding vectors inject infective larvae (L3) into the host skin during a blood meal. Depending on the species, the L3 will then migrate to its specific site. In the murine model of filariasis Litomosoides sigmodontis L3 also reach the pleural cavity where they moult twice then mate and produce microfilariae. Migration patterns from the skin to the pleural cavity are partially known and involve a lymphatic phase. Here we present a sequential analysis of L3 infection from their inoculation to day 8 when they are settled in the pleural cavity, revealing the presence of L3 in the lung. Pulmonary damage including haemorrhages and granulomas is also observed suggesting that L3 could migrate to the pulmonary circulation and capillaries from where they could exit the lung to reach the pleural cavity. This induces a local inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil activation and upregulation.
