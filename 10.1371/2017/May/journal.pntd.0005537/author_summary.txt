Dengue is the most important human vector-borne disease. Several studies have shown DENV presence in mammalian wildlife such as bats, thus considering them putative reservoirs or hosts. We aimed to elucidate if bats that cohabit in houses in close proximity with humans may be involved in a dengue transmission cycle. We sampled bats in low and high dengue incidence areas during the dry (low mosquito abundance) and wet (high mosquito abundance) seasons. We analyzed blood and several organs. As previously reported, we found DENV nucleic acid and neutralizing antibodies in a small percentage of blood samples, but virus detection in all organs was negative. We were able to show that dengue found in all positive samples was in low concentration and thus virus isolation was unsuccessful. We found positive intestine samples which may suggest infection through DENV-positive mosquito ingestion. Furthermore, mosquitoes sampled in close vicinity of batsâ€™ roosting place were not feeding on these mammals. Virus sequence analysis from bats and humans show a spillover effect from humans to bats. Taken together, our results indicate that bats do not sustain sufficient virus amplification in order to function as reservoirs and exclude them as players in the dengue virus transmission cycle.
