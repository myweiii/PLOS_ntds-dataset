Reducing the public health burden of rabies is most effectively achieved by elimination of the disease from its hosts. While the role of dogs and many wild carnivore species in maintaining and transmitting rabies virus is well established, our understanding of the role of many bat species in this regard is still incomplete. Several North American bat species are known to be rabies virus reservoirs, but the role of bats of the Myotis genus has been unclear due to the very limited number of laboratory confirmed rabies cases detected in these bats and the challenge in assigning species to poorly preserved bat carcasses. Our study utilised a collection of rabid bats collected across Canada over 25 years to address this issue. Genetic barcoding was used to identify the specimens to species and the virus was characterised by partial genome sequencing. Host barcoding proved to be crucial for correct species assignment to many specimens and allowed the identification of certain Myotis species as reservoirs for several genetically distinct variants of the rabies virus. The geographical distribution of these viral variants, and its correlation with the ecological and taxonomic properties of the hosts, are described. While most of these variants belong to a single rabies virus lineage, one variant associated with the long-legged bat appears to have emerged relatively recently following transmission from a big brown bat reservoir. Consistent with this observation, comparison of the rabies viruses associated with Myotis bats in North and South America clearly shows that rabies has emerged in members of this genus on several separate occasions.
