Liposomal amphotericin B is presently being used as first-line treatment option against visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent. However, the need for temperature-controlled transport and storage limits its widespread use in rural areas. Previous studies already suggested that paromomycin-miltefosine combination therapy could be a valuable alternative, side passing some of the disadvantages associated with monotherapy, such as development of drug resistance. As the first reports of miltefosine resistant clinical isolates have already surfaced and paromomycin resistance could be easily induced under laboratory conditions, it remains essential to assess the risk of developing resistance against both drugs upon combination therapy. This study evaluated the efficacy of combined therapy against a Leishmania species closely related to the agent found in the Indian subcontinent, using both in vitro and in vivo models with the aim to select multidrug-resistant species by simultaneous exposure to paromomycin and miltefosine. The combination of both drugs in the hamster model resulted in a cumulative efficacy but did not lead to a significant susceptibility decrease, indicating that paromomycin-miltefosine combination therapy may represent a safe and affordable treatment option for visceral leishmaniasis.
