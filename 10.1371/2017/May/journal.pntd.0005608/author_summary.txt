Zika is an emerging mosquito-borne infection for which vaccines or specific treatments are not available to combat and control its rapid dissemination and deleterious effects. This work describes a novel strategy for the development of a virus-like particle (VLP) based Zika vaccine and shows its effectiveness when tested in a murine model. VLPs are non-infections mimics of the Zika virus, thus chemical inactivation is not required. A VLP vaccine is able to maintain native epitopes structures and to perform better than an inactivated Zika virus control. Our results show feasibility for the rapid development of a safe and potentially highly effective VLP based Zika vaccine for humans.
