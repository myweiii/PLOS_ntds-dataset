We were invited by one community in East Arnhem Land to develop and deliver an ivermectin MDA to reduce the prevalence of Strongyloides and scabies. We demonstrated a sustained reduction in Strongyloides seroprevalence following the ivermectin MDA. Strongyloides is endemic in many Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities with seroprevalence ranging from 35â€“60%. Utilizing a before and after study design, we measured Strongyloides seroprevalence by ELISA through population census with sequential MDAs at baseline and month 12. Strongyloides seroprevalence reduced from 21% at baseline to 5% at month 6 after the first MDA. For the baseline cohort this reduction was sustained at month 12, falling to 2% at month 18 after the second MDA. For new entrants to the cohort at month 12, seroprevalence reduced from 25% to 7%.
