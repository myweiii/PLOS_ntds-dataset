As live-attenuated dengue vaccine candidates are developed, it is important to ascertain their safety in all populations, regardless of past exposure to dengue, closely related flaviviruses, or similar vaccines. Each of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes can cause clinical disease. Severe dengue disease may be life-threatening and is epidemiologically linked to secondary infection with a serotype distinct from the first infection. Candidate tetravalent dengue vaccines are designed to induce neutralizing antibody responses to all serotypes, but confirmation is needed that vaccination itself, as a secondary exposure, is not associated with the development of enhanced reactogenicity. The National Institutes of Health live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate, TV003, has previously been shown to be safe and immunogenic in flavivirus-na√Øve populations. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of TV003 in individuals previously exposed to flaviviruses and demonstrated tolerability and strong, broad immunogenicity across serotypes. No subjects experienced any dengue-like illness. Vaccine viremia was self-limited and occurred at acceptably low levels compared to those associated with severe dengue from natural infection. TV003 is well-tolerated in healthy adults, regardless of flavivirus exposure, and will be evaluated next in DENV-endemic settings.
