Chagas disease is classified as one of the 17 most important neglected diseases by the World Health Organization (WHO). The majority of infected individuals live in 21 countries of Central and South America. Estimates of mortality attributable to Chagas disease vary considerably (between 0.2% and 19.2% annually). To improve the measurement of disease burden and policy decision-making in regard to treatment availability, more accurate estimates of mortality, especially among otherwise asymptomatic seropositive individuals are needed,. This study compares mortality rates and causes of death of asymptomatic blood donors who tested seropositive for Chagas disease and seronegative for all screening tests conducted in Brazil. Mortality status was ascertained by linking donor names with the Brazilian national mortality information system (SIM). The study found that donors who tested Chagas disease seropositive had risk of death from all causes 2.3 (95% CI, 1.8â€“3.0) times greater than seronegative ones. The data also suggest that the SIM may underestimate the total number of deaths attributable to Chagas disease in Brazil.
