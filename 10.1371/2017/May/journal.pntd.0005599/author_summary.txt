Many countries are currently scaling up efforts to control schistosomiasis, a helminthic disease for which preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel is the main control tool. In order to apply WHO guidelines on how frequently to treat a given district or similar geographic unit for schistosomiasis, survey-based estimates of infection prevalence are required. However, the optimal size and design of survey for generating such data is not clear, and there is a clear trade-off between accuracy and cost–larger surveys provide more accurate information with which to target treatment, but cost more to carry out. Here, we systematically assess what size and design of simple 2-stage cluster survey (where primary school children are tested for infection), might best enable control programmes to implement WHO treatment guidelines. We use empirical data on schistosomiasis distribution from three African countries together with computer simulations to compare survey performance, in terms of accuracy and cost-efficiency–the ability of a survey to accurately determine treatment frequency, per unit cost. We show that although small surveys of around 5 schools per district are frequently adopted for mapping schistosomiasis, such small surveys are prone to miss endemic schistosomiasis fairly often, and are also not cost efficient. Our results suggest that among the designs tested, surveys involving 15–20 schools per district optimise cost-efficiency, providing the most accurate treatment decisions per dollar spent. These findings have important implications for the schistosomiasis control community, and provide the first evidence-based suggestion of a simple survey design for mapping schistosomiasis in endemic countries.
