Dengue is the most significant mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans. Up to one third of the world population is at risk of dengue virus (DENV) infection, transmitted through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes. Bali, a well-known international tourist destination, is regularly ravaged by dengue disease. This disease impacts the health of both local people and visitors thus imposing a heavy economic burden. Bali has a constant flow of travelers and labors that contribute to the spread of DENV infection. Detailed characterization of DENV from Bali is limited; most reports are from travel-acquired cases. Here, we study dengue clinical and virological aspects in local Balinese people. We presented the clinical spectrum of the disease and the virological characteristics, observing the circulation of genetically diverse endemic virus strains including strains which are closely related to imported viruses in neighboring countries. The circulation of a lineage of DENV-2 proposed to cause outbreak in the past is also identified. Our study provides data on the genetic of circulating DENV in Bali which are useful for further applications, such as to monitor the virus transmission and outbreak investigation in the region.
