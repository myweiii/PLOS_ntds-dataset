Over 12 million people worldwide are infected by Leishmania parasites and many more are at risk of being infected. In the mammalian host, Leishmania parasites live in intracellular compartments called parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs). We have previously shown that Retro-2, a member of a novel class of small retrograde pathway inhibitors, caused reduced LPV sizes and lower parasite numbers during L. mexicana sp. infections. The purpose of this study was to determine if analogs of Retro-2cycl reported to have superior potency in the inhibition of retrograde pathway-dependent phenomena are also more effective than the parent compound in controlling Leishmania infections. We show that two optimized analogs of Retro-2cycl are significantly more effective than the parent compound at controlling Leishmania infections and in the reversal of parasite induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Moreover, we show that the analogs kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures, which is a desirable characteristic for any compound that is being considered to treat Leishmania infections. Together, these studies validate and extend the published structure-activity relationship analyses of Retro-2cycl. In addition, they show that the Retro-2cycl analogs reverse the effects of the parasite on macrophage responses that are likely to affect the overall host response to infection.
