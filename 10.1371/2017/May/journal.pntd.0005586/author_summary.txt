Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections contribute substantially to death and morbidity due to diarrheal illness and are associated with serious sequelae including malnutrition, stunted growth, and intellectual impairment among young children in developing countries. Effective engagement of intestinal epithelial cells is essential for ETEC pathogenicity. Consequently, pathovar specific plasmid-encoded adhesin structures known as colonization factors (CFs) have been a principal target for vaccines. However, tremendous inter-strain variation in the carriage of gene clusters encoding different CFs and significant antigenic diversity of the CF adhesins has posed a challenge to vaccine development. In contrast, type 1 pili are encoded by the fim operon located in the chromosome of most ETEC strains and are highly conserved. While type 1 pili are known to play a critical role in virulence of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, the present studies represent the first detailed examination of the contribution of these pili in ETEC pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate that ETEC type 1 pili are essential for optimal interactions with intestinal epithelia and that they play a critical role in virulence. These data may inform additional approaches toward development of broadly protective vaccines for these pathogens of global importance.
