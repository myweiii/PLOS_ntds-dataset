Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease of poverty with global public health impact. Caused by species of the Leishmania parasite, it may manifest itself as slow to heal skin ulcers, metastatic disease affecting the mouth and nose or systemic disease affecting internal organs (kala azar or visceral leishmaniasis). In common with other poverty-related neglected diseases, there have been few incentives for pharma to develop new drugs and vaccines. The few drugs currently available may cause serious side effects and/or only work well in some settings. No vaccines are available for prevention (prophylactic vaccines) or treatment (therapeutic vaccines). The clinical development of vaccines requires a series of clinical trials (Phases Iâ€“IV). Phase I studies assess primarily safety and are conducted in healthy volunteers. Later phase trials then involve either more healthy subjects (for prophylactic vaccines) or patients (for therapeutic vaccines) and provide additional safety data as well as preliminary data on efficacy. Here, we describe the results from a Phase I first-in-human trial of a new vaccine for leishmaniasis. Our vaccine is novel compared to those previously tested in that it is designed to target induction of a specific type of immune response (CD8+ T cells). We show here that the vaccine is safe in healthy volunteers and induces robust CD8+ T cell responses. The study represents an important step towards the development of a leishmaniasis vaccine.
