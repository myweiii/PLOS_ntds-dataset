Infection with Clonorchis sinensis is a major public health problem in Asia, resulting in loss of liver function and chronic liver diseases, including cancers. However, to the best of our knowledge, the immune response to fluke infection in the liver has not been systematically investigated. Here, we demonstrated that C. sinensis infection triggered a shift in the characteristics of macrophages, the primary cells associated with host immunity, throughout the course of the wormâ€™s life cycle. Eventually, the increased number of M2 macrophages may result in fibrosis and the remodeling of bile ducts within the liver. Our findings suggest that, while the infection initially led to changes in the immune response that facilitated C. sinensis survival, ongoing infection may also reduce the severity of disruption of liver function. Hepatic macrophages activated during C. sinensis infection may not only be operating in histological lesions around the bile duct, but may also play a role in local immunity.
