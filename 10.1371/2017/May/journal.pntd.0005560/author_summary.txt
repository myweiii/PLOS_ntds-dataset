Leprosy remains a global public health issue with an annual new case detection of approximately 200,000â€“250,000 patients. The current study targets leprosy patient contacts, who constitute the group of individuals at highest risk of developing the disease. Treatment of the index case (patient) and BCG vaccination of his/her contacts are among the measures known to decrease the risk of household leprosy contacts contracting the disease. In the present work, the impact of these two measures on the immune response of contacts to mycobacterial antigens was investigated, showing improvement in the cellular immune response to both specific and shared M. leprae antigens and an increase in secretion of proinflammatory mediators, which likely explains the protective effect of these measures against leprosy.
