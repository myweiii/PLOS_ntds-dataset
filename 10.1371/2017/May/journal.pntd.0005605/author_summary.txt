Neurocysticercosis is a common parasitic infection of the central nervous system. It is caused by larval form of Taenia solium and it has been identified as a “Neglected Tropical Disease” endemic in south East Asia, including Nepal, by WHO. The clinical features in children are pleomorphic depending on the number, location and size of cysticerci. The parenchymatous lesions are presented as neurological symptoms like sudden onset seizures, encephalitis, raised intracranial pressure and neuropsychiatric symptoms. CT and MRI are the main diagnostic tools. Maximum incidence was found in school age children (6–15 years). Year wise review of percentage of NCC, revealed a declining trend from 20.83% in 2009 to 5.37% in 2014. The decline in the incidence of NCC noted in our study might be due to biannual deworming using Albendazole as a part of School Health and Nutrition Programme started by Ministry of Health Services, Nepal in 2008 and extended to all the districts of the country. In addition construction of household and school toilets to avoid open defecation, health education and hand washing facilities might have played a role. Large multicentre trials to evaluate role of biannual Albendazole to prevent cysticercosis is recommended.
