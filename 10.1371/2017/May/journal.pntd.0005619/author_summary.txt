The control of lymphatic filariasis depends on the treatment of entire endemic communities, ensuring that a greater proportion of the population is treated. In urban areas, this can be very difficult to achieve. In Ghana, parts of the Greater Accra Region, where the capital city is located, are also endemic for lymphatic filariasis. Treatment in these areas started in 2006, but the proportion of people treated has continuously been below the required programmatic coverage levels. To understand the reasons behind this, a study was undertaken in three endemic districts. The study was carried out in three stages; pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment. Individuals and groups of people were interviewed in the pre-treatment phase, following which their concerns were used to plan and execute treatment activities. After treatment, some individuals were again interviewed to assess the effectiveness of the interventions. The results showed that the knowledge and behavior of community members towards the disease and treatment activities improved from the pre-treatment to the post-treatment reviews. Many factors were identified including, financial, management and leadership issues that should be considered when planning treatment activities in urban areas.
