Accurately tracking the success of elimination programs becomes increasingly difficult as elimination nears. For some diseases, such as lymphatic filariasis, this is compounded by the absence of symptoms during the infectious period as well as the natural and unevenly-distributed presence of small residual foci of infection (microfoci). Microfoci, when they are present, pose a threat to long-term elimination because they may lead to recrudescence, but it is unclear which surveillance approaches provide sufficient confidence to confirm their absence on a large scale. While we do not know the concentration of infections in a microfocus that would lead to certain recrudescence, we can quantitate the ability of different surveillance approaches to detect microfoci of different size and concentration. The model presented in this paper can be used to inform late-stage elimination program surveillance strategies for infections that include, but are not limited to, lymphatic filariasis.
