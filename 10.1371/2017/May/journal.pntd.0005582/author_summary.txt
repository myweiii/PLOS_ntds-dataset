The study focuses on the knowledge and socio-cultural practices around Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Baringo County. It is intended to identify means through which communities in Baringo County could be exposed to RVF in the event of an outbreak. Specifically, it addresses knowledge of RVF transmission routes, practices in handling and consumption of meat, milk and blood; livestock disease management and disposal of dead animals/aborted foetuses. The study found that community members engaged in practices that would expose them to RVF in the event of an outbreak. These practices include milking and consuming milk from sick animals; consuming meat from slaughtered sick animals and those that die from disease; rarely having animals that were slaughtered at home inspected by a veterinary officer or a local animal expert before consumption; using uncertified techniques to test meat for safety of consumption; and treating sick livestock with both conventional and herbal treatments without the guidance of veterinary personnel. Further, RVF infections are likely to follow a gendered pattern based on the division of labor in livestock production. Based on their results, the study authors recommend community education to increase RVF awareness.
