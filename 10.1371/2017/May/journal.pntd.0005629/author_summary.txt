Visceral leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease, caused by Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum species, found in Asia, South America, East Africa and Southern Europe. Currently available treatments present either serious side effects or high prices and, therefore, the identification of a new generation of antileishmanial drugs is clearly an unmet medical need. In order to find new and safer drugs, pharmaceutical companies and research institutes have engaged in screening of large compound collections on cell-based systems. These assays are more likely to predict the in vivo potency of the hits identified compared to assays based on the inhibition of a specific target, but do not provide any information regarding one of the most important parameters, together with PK/PD profile, used to predict the effect of a drug as it is the mode of action. In addition, most of the available assays rely on a single endpoint determination of compound potency and, therefore, do not evaluate rate of action, a property linked to the mode of action. Although there is only limited knowledge on the PK/PD profile for current antileishmanial drugs amphotericin B and miltefosine, the observation that in vitro fast-acting amphotericin B requires shorter treatment regimen than in vitro slow-acting drug miltefosine seems to suggest that this property could be very useful for progressing the most promising hit compounds to more advanced stages of the drug discovery process. In fact, progression of fast-acting compounds over slow-acting ones is the current strategy at the Kinetoplastid DPU. For these reasons, we present here the application of a rate of action assay to a promising compound set displaying potencies against the intracellular Leishmania donovani parasite (”Leishmania donovani box”) in the micromolar to sub-micromolar range as well as its validation for use in the hit prioritisation within drug discovery.
