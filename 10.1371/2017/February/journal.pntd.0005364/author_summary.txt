Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, a bacillus transmitted by patients with multibacillary (MB) disease. Men and elderly are more likely to have MB leprosy, which has been attributed to an increased exposure to infection by male sex, decreased access of men to healthcare resulting in delayed diagnosis and long incubation period for MB disease. In this study, we found that the odds ratio for MB leprosy is two-fold higher for men than for women in all Brazilian states, independent of their endemic level. The same was observed for patients aged 60 or older compared to younger cases. Detection rates for MB leprosy remained higher for men and elderly patients timely detected (without physical disabilities), showing that late diagnosis is not enough to explain this association. Additionally, we showed that M. leprae load is higher in men than in women, despite early detection. These findings are relevant, because main activities to diagnose new cases of leprosy in Brazil have been focused on school surveys, detecting children who most likely have paucibacillary leprosy, which is non-contagious. To prevent transmission within the community, additional activities need to include groups at greater risk for MB leprosy. As such, we suggest that specific strategies for disease control should be adopted to effectively reach males and the elderly in endemic areas for leprosy.
