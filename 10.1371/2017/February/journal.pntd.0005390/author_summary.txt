The innate immune system is the first response against invading pathogens like the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or parasitic worms (helminths). The adaptive immune response takes over after being primed by the innate immune response. Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis typically gives rise to a pro-inflammatory T-helper(Th)-1 response while helminths promote a Th2 response which is needed to combat the infection. Co-infection with both of these pathogens could lead to reduced immunity contributing to worsening of tuberculosis due to an increased Th2 response caused by helminths. We found that antigens from different helminth species (a nematode, a cestode and a trematode) caused different responses towards Mtb in macrophages. Depending on the helminth species, the macrophages can be more or less capable of combating Mtb infection and priming the adaptive immune response, which in turn would influence the outcome of tuberculosis. Thus, exposure to helminth antigens, in a species-dependent manner, could lead to a better control of Mtb infection or worsening of tuberculosis.
