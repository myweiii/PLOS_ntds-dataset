Leishmania (V.) braziliensis and L. (L.) amazonensis are protozoa that infect macrophages and cause cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis. Here we showed that both Leishmania species induce the production of IL-32γ in human macrophages. This intracellular and pro-inflammatory cytokine mediates the production of cytokines, especially TNFα and IL-8, in Leishmania-infected macrophages. Differential effects of IL-32γ on TNFα, IL-10 and IL-1Ra production after infection with distinct Leishmania species were detected, consistent with the concept that IL-32γ can differently influence the outcome of inflammatory process in leishmaniasis lesions. Moreover, IL-32γ upregulates microbicidal molecules, antimicrobial peptides, as well as NO, which are known as important factors in parasite control. These results underscore IL-32γ as a crucial cytokine to host defense against leishmaniasis.
