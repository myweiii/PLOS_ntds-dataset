Rickettsia typhi causes endemic typhus, a relatively mild disease. However, complications such as encephalitis, hepatitis, pneumonia and others can occur in severe cases. In immunodeficient CB17 SCID mice R. typhi causes a 100% fatal infection and we show here that adoptively transferred CD8+ as well as CD4+ T cells that acquire a TH1 phenotype protect these animals from severe disease and death. We further analyzed the requirements for T cell-mediated protection and found that the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells is not essential for protection and that the release of IFNγ by these cells is more critical than the cytolytic activity for long-term control of the bacteria. Surprisingly, CD4+ T cells that lack IFNγ still protect 30–90% of R. typhi-infected CB17 SCID mice. These cells show a TH17 phenotype, producing high amounts of IL-17A and IL-22 in addition to TNFα. In R. typhi-infected CB17 SCID mice that receive IFNγ-deficient CD4+ T cells the neutralization of either TNFα or IL-17A mitigates disease and leads to enhanced survival, demonstrating harmful effects of these cytokines although both of them may contribute to bacterial elimination along with IL-22. We conclude that CD4+ TH17 cells are sufficient to protect against R. typhi if the detrimental effects of either TNFα or IL-17A can be inhibited. This is the first report demonstrating protection against an obligate intracellular bacterium by CD4+ TH17 cells.
