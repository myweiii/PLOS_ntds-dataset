    "Abstract": "Endemic typhus caused by Rickettsia (R.) typhi is an emerging febrile disease that can be fatal due to multiple organ pathology. Here we analyzed the requirements for protection against R. typhi by T cells in the CB17 SCID model of infection. BALB/c wild-type mice generate CD4+ TH1 and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells both of which are sporadically reactivated in persistent infection. Either adoptively transferred CD8+ or CD4+ T cells protected R. typhi-infected CB17 SCID mice from death and provided long-term control. CD8+ T cells lacking either IFN\u03b3 or Perforin were still protective, demonstrating that the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells is not essential for protection. Immune wild-type CD4+ T cells produced high amounts of IFN\u03b3, induced the release of nitric oxide in R. typhi-infected macrophages and inhibited bacterial growth in vitro via IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1. However, adoptive transfer of CD4+IFN\u03b3-/- T cells still protected 30\u201390% of R. typhi-infected CB17 SCID mice. These cells acquired a TH17 phenotype, producing high amounts of IL-17A and IL-22 in addition to TNF\u03b1, and inhibited bacterial growth in vitro. Surprisingly, the neutralization of either TNF\u03b1 or IL-17A in CD4+IFN\u03b3-/- T cell recipient mice did not alter bacterial elimination by these cells in vivo, led to faster recovery and enhanced survival compared to isotype-treated animals. Thus, collectively these data show that although CD4+ TH1 cells are clearly efficient in protection against R. typhi, CD4+ TH17 cells are similarly protective if the harmful effects of combined production of TNF\u03b1 and IL-17A can be inhibited."
