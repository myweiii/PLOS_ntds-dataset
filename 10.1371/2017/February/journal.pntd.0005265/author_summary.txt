The unprecedented spread of EVD across the fragile healthcare systems of West Africa during the 2013â€“2015 outbreak infected over 28,600 patients and established it as a disease for which low-income countries are at disproportionate risk. In order to improve the standard of patient care, it is essential to better allocate scarce resources amongst the heterogeneous symptomatic presentations of EVD. This retrospective cohort study on 158 EVD(+) patients in Sierra Leone constructs 2 easy-to-use scoring systems that accurately stratify EVD severity and thus objectively identify the patients in most need of intensive therapy. Using statistically weighted symptoms and demographic characteristics, we obtained scores with a 91% and 97% ability to discriminate death at or after triage respectively. These scores included Ebola viral load, patient age and referral time as well as the symptoms of disorientation, haemorrhage and myalgia. Further univariate analysis revealed several independent predictors of mortality, where patients aged between 5 and 25 years were most likely to survive, while malaria co-infection increased the risk of death by 2.5-fold (p = 0.01). Correcting referral-time for viral load, we also quantify the benefits of early reporting as a 12% mortality risk reduction per day (p = 0.012). Mortality in this cohort was 3-fold more than patients treated in resource-rich settings (60.8% vs. 18%) and we propose that focused patient care is a feasible and low-cost effort that may begin to close this gap.
