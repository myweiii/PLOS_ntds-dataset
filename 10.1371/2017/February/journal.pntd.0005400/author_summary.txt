Schistosoma haematobium is a parasite that infects the human genito-urinary tract. People get infected with the parasite through contact with fresh water and children are at major risk. The complications linked to this infection are due to an inflammation caused by accumulation of the eggs in peri-bladder veins. If not treated, infections can last years and different degrees of severity are observed. These range from thickening of the bladder wall and blurriness of the mucosa to more serious lesions such as pseudo polyps and masses in the bladder that can, with time, evolve in cancer of the bladder. We analyzed preschool-aged children (PSAC) and school-aged children (SAC) with ultrasound before and after praziquantel treatment. Children were randomly assigned to different doses of praziquantel (20, 40 or 60 mg/kg) or to placebo at baseline. Six months after treatment all children underwent another ultrasound of the urinary tract. We included 162 PSAC and 141 SAC at baseline, of which 128 PSAC and 122 SAC had a second ultrasound evaluation six months afterwards. In addition, urine was sampled at both time points for presence of blood, proteins and signs of infection (leukocytes and nitrates). Six months post-treatment 45% of PSAC and 58% of SAC were S. haematobium positive. Already at the first screening 43% of PSAC and 67% of SAC had bladder lesions. After treatment 50% of PSAC and 58% of SAC still had pathology linked to the infection. We found a correlation between the treatment dose and healing of bladder lesions. On the other hand, we experienced an aggravation of lesions in the placebo group. Praziquantel is given to SAC as preventive chemotherapy every year at national level, where this parasite is endemic. This program should be expanded and include PSAC as well in order to reduce the consequences of infection.
