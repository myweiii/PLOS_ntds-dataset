One of the principal goals of the last decades regarding public health in Latin America was the reduction of the geographic range and infestation rates of triatomines, the insect vectors of Chagas’ disease. However, the elimination of vector transmission has failed in the Gran Chaco ecoregion, even in areas subjected to intense vector control efforts with pyrethroid insecticides. Therefore, detecting the reasons for the persistence of these vectors has been recognized as a priority by public health authorities. Metabolic insecticide resistance due to enhancement of detoxification activity is one of the principal resistance mechanisms observed in insects. In this study, we analyzed the main enzyme superfamilies known to be involved in insecticide resistance in other insects in four important Chagas’ disease vector species from different regions of Latin America. This was made in a comparative manner using well-studied insect genomes as references. We have found gene expansions for several families related to insecticide resistance, while others showed a reduction. Augmented expression of a CYP gene may suggest contribution to pyrethroid resistance in highly resistant populations of Triatoma infestans from the Gran Chaco. Our results increase the knowledge of potential insecticide resistance mechanisms in vectors of Chagas’ disease and provide relevant information to this field.
