Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by the Leishmania parasite. It is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies when infected females take a bloodmeal from a mammalian host. The transmission of Leishmania species involves complex ecological interactions between parasite–vector and vector–host. Until recently, the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, which belongs to a species complex, had been solely incriminated in Latin American transmission of Leishmania infantum. However, there are still uncertainties concerning the L. infantum transmission, especially in an urban area endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil. Along the years, Lutzomyia cruzi has been suspected of transmitting L. infantum in Corumbá and vicinity, and this study aimed to provide more accurate evidence of this phenomenon. Laboratory-reared Lu. cruzi were infected experimentally by allowing them to feed on dogs naturally infected with L. infantum and on hamsters infected with L. amazonensis. Our results identified important life cycle parameters of Lu. cruzi infected by Leishmania in laboratory conditions. We identified the components related to vectorial capacity, and also the vector incrimination criteria of Lu. cruzi for L. infantum. Additionally, we demonstrated the experimental transmission of L. amazonensis by Lu. cruzi to a naïve host, and revealed strong evidence that supports Lu. cruzi as a vector of L. infantum and as a permissive vector for L. amazonensis.
