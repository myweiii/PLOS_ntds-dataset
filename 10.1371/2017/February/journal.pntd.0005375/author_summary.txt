Leprosy is a disease that affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae), that to survive hides itself within the host cells and grows slowly. Its diagnosis is difficult and requires trained physicians. Laboratorial tests are frequently negative depending on individual response. M. leprae transmission is mainly man to man, because this is very important diagnosis and treatment of patients for breaking the transmission chain. We conducted a temporary campaign to detect previously unknown leprosy cases in midwestern Brazil and to compare the performance of different serological tests (anti-PGL-I and anti-LID-1 antibody titers by ELISA and by the NDO-LID rapid test). Four hundred thirty-four individuals were evaluated, and 44 (10.14%) were diagnosed with leprosy. Each test presented higher positivity in those individuals with multibacillary disease. For leprosy diagnosis, serological tests demonstrated specificities arround 70% for anti-PGL-1 and anti-LID ELISA; and arround 40% for NDO-LID. Sensitivities ranged from 48 to 62%. Anti-PGL-I and anti-LID-1 ELISA sensitivity values were 30.1% and 23.7% respectively, while NDO-LID sensitivity was 51.6% among contacts and non-contacts. The low specificity and sensitivity values of serological tests establish that they cannot be considered stand-alone diagnostics considering the importance of clinical manifestations in leprosy. Rather, we suggest using such tests as a means to triage potential patients for follow-up clinical examinations.
