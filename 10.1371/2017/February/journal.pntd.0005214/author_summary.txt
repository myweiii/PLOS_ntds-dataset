Tuberculosis is a disease of humans and animals which mainly affects the lungs but can also manifest in other organs. A variety of tuberculosis bacteria cause the disease and are usually transmitted through air, i.e. inhalation of aerosols. Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) occurs predominantly among domestic cattle, although wild animals are an important reservoir for transmission. Humans are usually infected with BTB through contaminated dairy products or close contact with cattle. While BTB has been eliminated in cattle and human populations of most high-income countries, it is still a major health threat in low- and middle-income countries. In Morocco, the disease frequently occurs in cattle and poses a health risk for humans. An effective intervention to reduce BTB among domestic cattle and reduce the risk to humans is slaughter of cattle which test positive for the disease. We simulated BTB in the Moroccan cattle and human populations using a disease transmission model. We assessed effects of test and slaughter in regard to elimination of disease in cattle and humans and estimated the associated costs with the model. The time to elimination of disease depended on the number of cattle tested. Our model suggests that the disease might be eliminated in cattle within 32 years if 40% of Moroccan cattle are tested annually and infected individuals are slaughtered or within 13 years if at least 90% of the cattle population are tested. The estimated total costs for the time periods until elimination ranged from 1.55 billion euros for testing and slaughter at 50% to 1.48 billion euros at 90%. These results can be used as a guide for planning BTB control policy in Morocco with regard to time frames and associated costs.
