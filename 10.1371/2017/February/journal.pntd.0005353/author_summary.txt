Visceral leishmaniasis [VL] is an important but neglected tropical disease that occurs worldwide. In areas where the disease is zoonotic, it is considered a serious public and animal health problem. In Brazil, despite the existing prevention and control programs, the disease is spreading, and in São Paulo State its dispersion presents a distinct temporal-geographic pattern. The goal of our study was to understand the landscape, climatic and economic factors that influence the dispersion of visceral leishmaniasis in Sao Paulo State, and then use these findings to predict its spread over time and space. To this end, we integrated data on the sand fly vector of the causative parasitic agent of VL, infected dogs and human cases. We find that landscape and climate were more important than economic factors in predicting competent vector, infected human and infected dog distributions, and the presence of the competent vector and infected dogs strongly influenced the dispersion of infected humans. Our study represents the first integrated investigation of vector and infected host invasion potential for individual municipalities, contributing to VL disease prevention and control planning in São Paulo State.
