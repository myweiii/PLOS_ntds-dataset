Taenia solium is a serious zoonotic helminth which is thought to be responsible for approximately 1/3rd of epilepsy cases in the developing world. The work presented in this paper aimed to understand what the risk is of acquiring T. solium taeniosis from pork slaughtered and consumed in western Kenya. In order to do this we built a stochastic risk assessment model to investigate the safety of pork reaching the consumer in terms of the risk of having viable T. solium cysts in any one portion of meat consumed. We found that pork represents a high risk product in this study area and therefore control strategies are urgently needed to reduce the public health risk posed by this product.
