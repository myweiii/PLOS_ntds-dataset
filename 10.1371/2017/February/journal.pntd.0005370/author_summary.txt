Cystic echinococcosis is a worldwide zoonosis of public health concern and economic significance caused by infection with the larval stage of the cestode Echinococcus granulosus. Chemotherapy treatment for this disease has had limited effectiveness thus far, which is why it is a dire need to find new drugs for its treatment. In order to survive, E. granulosus must compete with the host for the same metabolic resources. However, the cell energy is a commodity that these organisms cannot directly obtain from the host. Therefore, our treatment strategy was to interfere with the energy-generating and cell proliferation mechanisms in the larval stage of this cestode. In this study we focus on metformin, an anti-hyperglycemic and anti-proliferative drug, which exhibits considerable in vitro and in vivo activity against E. granulosus metacestodes. In experimentally infected mice, metformin-chemopreventive effect was evidenced and the combination of this drug with low doses of albendazole improved the anti-parasitic therapy results in late stage of cyst development. Therefore, the effects of these two drugs against E. granulosus warrant further investigations, in comparison to the current monotherapy of choice in humans carried out with albendazole.
