Leprosy is considered a neglected disease and still a public health problem in many countries where it was not yet eliminated, leading to a high disability rate and social stigma. The molecular mechanisms of M. leprae infection and immune evasion are still poorly known, raising the need for studies that may contribute to a better understanding of leprosy etiology, as well as improvement in diagnosis and treatment. Ficolin-3 is a soluble molecule of the innate immune system that recognizes a wide range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns leading to complement activation and phagocytosis. We observed high concentration of ficolin-3 in leprosy patients, likely caused by polymorphisms present in intronic regions of FCN3 gene, which may contribute to leprosy susceptibility by favoring M. leprae infection. This is the first study addressing FCN3 polymorphisms and ficolin-3 levels in leprosy, indicating it as a good candidate biomarker associated with the host response against M. leprae.
