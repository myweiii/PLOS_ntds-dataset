Given the medical importance of snakebite envenoming and the current shortage of antivenoms in sub-Saharan Africa, technological advances in antivenom development and production are needed. One of the avenues that could be taken involves the use of recombinant antivenoms based on oligoclonal mixtures of human IgG antibodies, since these may have the benefits of being compatible with the human immune system and their production is independent on animal immune systems and venom procurement. However, an important aspect of introducing recombinant antivenoms to the clinic is their cost of production given that snakebite victims are often poor rural workers living in remote parts of the tropical parts of the developing world. Here, we aim to provide cost estimates of recombinant antivenom manufacture with special focus on snakebite envenoming in sub-Saharan Africa. Our results indicate that recombinant antivenoms in the future will indeed be cost-competitive compared to existing animal-derived serum-based antivenoms. Furthermore, we outline different manufacturing strategies and suggest the use of caprylic acid precipitation as a low cost purification method following cultivation of CHO cells for antibody expression due to its use in current antivenom manufacture.
