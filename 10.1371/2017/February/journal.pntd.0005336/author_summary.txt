Less than 1% of patients infected with Trypanosoma cruzi have access to parasiticidal treatment with the two available drugs, including millions of patients in the early chronic phase who would greatly benefit from treatment. Furthermore, rural populations living under poor and marginalized conditions usually have little or no access to chemotherapeutic programs of Chagas and other neglected tropical diseases. Barriers to treatment range from misconceptions on medication-related risks to socio-cultural aspects, among others. This study addressed the challenge of diagnosis and treatment of T. cruzi infection in resource-poor, remote rural settings of the Argentine Chaco where 24% of residents up to 18 years of age were infected. The underlying premise was that participatory methods and multisector cooperation would increase program effectiveness. Our results show that diagnosis and treatment of T. cruzi infection there can be effectively addressed through strengthened primary healthcare attention and broad social participation with adequate external support, following an initial phase of intensified vector control and surveillance across the municipality. This strategy secured high diagnosis-and-treatment coverage and adherence; effectively managed adverse drug-related reactions; provided early evidence of a positive therapeutic response, and may stimulate healthcare services in the affected regions to aggressively bridge the treatment gap.
