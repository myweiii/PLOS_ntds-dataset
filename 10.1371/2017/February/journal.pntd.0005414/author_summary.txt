Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by infection with pathogenic strains of Leptospira. Most human infections arise from environmental exposure to contaminated freshwater environments or watered soils where pathogenic Leptospira are considered as able to survive for prolonged periods. Therefore, a good understanding of Leptospira survival strategy in the environment is a key step to identifying crucial factors amenable to interventions and public health actions to lower leptospirosis burden. In this study, we investigated the environmental presence and survival of pathogenic leptospires in areas where recent human leptospirosis cases had been reported. Although detection of Leptospira from complex environmental samples is difficult, we successfully detected the presence of pathogenic Leptospira in soils of suspected infection sites. In addition, we showed that these pathogenic leptospires were alive and present in soils several weeks after the infecting event. Typing of leptospiral DNA retrieved from the environment revealed identities between environmental pathogenic Leptospira and the causative strains involved in human leptospirosis index cases. Interestingly, we also identified yet unreported genotypes. Altogether, our work illustrates the potential of quantitative molecular assays for the rapid detection and typing of viable leptospires in environmental samples, which could prove useful to assess the risk of environmental exposure.
