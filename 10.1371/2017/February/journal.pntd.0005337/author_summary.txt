Anopheles darlingi is the major malaria vector in the Amazon. This species has been commonly described as highly anthropophilic throughout its geographic range, although little is known about its feeding preferences. Scant information is available regarding the origin of An. darlingi blood-meals. In the context of malaria elimination programs, the Human Blood Index (HBI) may provide crucial information regarding mosquito-human contact related to transmission dynamics. Additionally, collection of resting An. darlingi is challenging, mainly because the resting behavior of this species has not been well characterized. Our study, conducted from 2013â€“2015 in three localities in Loreto Department in the Peruvian Amazon, showed for the first time the efficacy of the barrier screen methodology for collecting recently blood-fed An. darlingi in a neotropical setting for the purpose of identifying the source of their blood-meals. Our data show that An. darlingi feeds on humans, Galliformes, dogs, pigs and goats, and that 30% of the mosquitoes fed on more than one type of host. Despite this opportunistic feeding behavior, however, An. darlingi is primarily anthropophilic. We hypothesize that mosquito population structure is associated with feeding preferences, which may affect the pattern of malaria transmission in the area.
