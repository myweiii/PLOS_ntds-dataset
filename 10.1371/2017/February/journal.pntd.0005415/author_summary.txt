Buruli ulcer disease (BUD) is a devastating skin disease characterised by nodules, plaque or oedema at early stages, which progress to a characteristic form of ulcer. Without treatment the disease can cause broader tissue destruction, affect bones and cause permanent disabilities. BUD is treated with a combination of two antibiotics over a period of eight weeks. Overall this treatment scheme is effective, but duration of the healing process varies strongly. Specific immune responses are of major importance for controlling other mycobacterial infections (e.g. tuberculosis), but are also used for immune-based diagnostic tests. However, detailed knowledge of specific immune responses in BUD patients is missing. The aim of this study was to characterise the specific cytokine response of CD4+ T helper cells in BUD patients and to correlate specific T cell subsets to clinical disease progression. Using flow cytometry on Mycobacterium ulcerans-stimulated blood samples, we identified specific cytokine-secreting T cell subsets, induced in BUD patients. Proportions of a CD4+ T cell subset, producing a single cytokine were positively associated with lesion size and healing time. Results of this study provide deeper insights in the specific immune response in BUD patients and identify a potential indicator for early diagnosis and disease progression.
