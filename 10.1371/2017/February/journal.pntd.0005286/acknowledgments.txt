The Aedes albopictus control program in the Torres Strait was implemented with support from the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, Torres and Cape Hospital and Health Services, Torres Shire Council and NPA Regional Council. We are grateful to the Dengue Action Response Team (DART) in Cairns for conducting the field work tirelessly in relatively tough operational conditions. The team includes Rodney Bellwood, Rebecca Adamczyk, Kevin Woolley, Robert Malone, Arthur Giblin, Emma Peak, Karel van Horck, Barry Bennett, Petra Baldwin, Vivian Lawler and Julie Kidston. Support from Torres-based personnel was essential for the success of the program and we appreciate the input of many people over the years including Ursula Sabatino, Ronald Williams, Harold Matthew, Harry Seriat and Environmental Health Workers stationed on various islands.
