Dengue virus (DENV) infections are typically asymptomatic, but severe and potentially lethal disease symptoms, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, are associated with secondary infections. This suggests that pre-existing immunity from primary infection plays a central role in DENV pathogenesis. In order to characterize the antibody response in primary and secondary infections, we assembled the Dengue Virus Antibody Database, a freely accessible online repository (http://denvabdb.bhsai.org) storing over 400 unique monoclonal dengue-specific antibodies annotated by their 1) origin and host immune history, 2) activity information against all four dengue serotypes, and 3) epitope mapping information. Here we demonstrate the utility of the database by carrying out a large-scale analysis to characterize shifts in epitope fine-specificity and serotype cross-reactivity in primary and secondary infections. In particular, we show how the antibody response in secondary infections displays a systematic shift towards increased serotype cross-reactivity by focusing on a subset of cross-reactive epitopes on the dengue E protein. Our findings suggest a mechanistic basis for this shift in epitope and serotype specificity and demonstrate how a detailed understanding of the antibody response can provide insight into the mechanisms of dengue pathogenesis.
