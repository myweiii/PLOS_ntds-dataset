Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease; millions of people are infected with this parasite. One of the major challenges to manage infected patients is the low efficacy of currently available treatments, especially during chronic infection. Different T. cruzi genotypes are known to differ in response to existing drugs (e.g., TcI is quite resistant), and differences among individuals in immune response also are believed to play a role determining therapeutic efficacy. Experimental models and in vitro systems have been proposed for rational searches for new compounds for treating infected individuals, optimally before the infection becomes clinically manifested as Chagas disease. In the field of drug development, the non-human primate models offer a unique and valuable contribution, as a consequence of patho-physiological similarities that mimic many human diseases, including Chagas disease. In the present study, we further investigated the functional features of the immune response triggered by TcI T. cruzi-infection, characterizing the ex vivo as well as the in vitro cytokine microenvironment, upon T. cruzi-antigen recall. Our results revealed that chronically infected cynomolgus macaques display a similar ex vivo cytokine signature to that observed in chronic human Chagas disease. Moreover, CH macaques display a complex cross-talk among the cytokine+ leukocyte subsets, enhanced by TcI T. cruzi-antigen recall in vitro. These findings provide additional insights that further validate these non-human primates as experimental models for rational development of new therapeutic agents for Chagas disease.
