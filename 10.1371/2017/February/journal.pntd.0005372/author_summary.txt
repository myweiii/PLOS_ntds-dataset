Schistosomiasis is the disease caused by infection with Schistosoma parasitic flukes. Depending on the infecting species, chronic Schistosoma infection can cause a variety of pathologies including liver and spleen enlargement, fibrosis and hypertension of the portal vein of the liver, or bladder ulceration and deformities and kidney blockage. Infection can also cause anemia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and decreased physical fitness. In our study, we quantified the reductions in prevalence of infection-related morbidities among populations with Schistosoma infection, as achieved by giving one or more drug treatments. We systematically reviewed 71 available reports of Schistosoma-related morbidity reduction and determined, based on a meta-analysis of the primary data, that the odds of persisting morbidity progressively decrease when greater post-treatment reductions in parasite burden are achieved, as reflected by reduced egg counts in standard diagnostic testing. This suggests that repeated or more effective anti-parasite drug treatment will be a valuable tool for greater reduction of Schistosoma-related patient morbidities in affected areas.
