Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in the world. Though treatments for schistosomiasis infection exist, there is no vaccine, and reinfection is common in areas where the parasite occurs. One possible way to mitigate schistosomiasis is by controlling the transmission of the parasite larvae from the snails that carry them. Understanding the snail-parasite relationship is essential for the development of new means to interrupt transmission of the parasite from snails to humans. Snails possess immune mechanisms for fighting infection, most of which are based in hemolymph tissue. Here we characterize a novel protein, Grctm6, in a snail host of schistosome parasites. Grctm6 is structurally similar to certain other immune proteins and is present in snail hemolymph. Importantly, we demonstrate that the release of schistosomes by infected snails is exacerbated when this protein is experimentally suppressed in live snails. These results support the suitability of Grctm6 as a possible target for reducing the transmission of this human disease.
