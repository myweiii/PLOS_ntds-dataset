Cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites (CelTOS) presents a pivotal role in the cell traversal of host cells in mosquito and vertebrate hosts. For this reason, it has been considered a potential novel alternative for a vaccine against malaria caused by P. falciparum. However, little is known about its orthologous P. vivax CelTOS. Although the genetic diversity of this protein could be a limiting factor for acquisition of immunity and present implications for an effective vaccine development, it has never been explored. Thus, considering that the epidemiology of malaria in Brazil presents variable transmission rates and the knowledge on the genetic polymorphism of PvCelTOS remains unknown, we aimed to identify the pvceltos gene in isolates from five different regions of the Brazilian Amazon and to study the potential impacts of the genetic diversity of PvCelTOS in protein structures and predicted epitopes. Our findings indicate that PvCelTOS is an extremely conserved protein, presenting only four SNPs in the entire sequences of field isolates from Brazilian Amazon. The two non-synonymous mutations found in our field isolates presented no significant effect on the protein structure and a very low impact on potential T and B-cell epitopes indicated by our epitope prediction. Collectively, our data suggest that the small need to avoid the immune recognition by the human host and its importance on the parasiteâ€™s survival and transmission reflects a very conservative profile of pvceltos gene in field samples from Brazil and other endemic areas worldwide.
