Rift Valley fever (RVF), is a neglected, emerging, mosquito-borne disease that has caused outbreaks in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. RVF outbreaks have a severe negative impact on livestock, human health and economy, placing further demands on communities already experiencing high levels of poverty. We believe there is an immediate need to develop new approaches that will tackle the ongoing spread of RVF. One such approach would prioritize outbreak prevention by involving local communities in the surveillance of emerging zoonotic diseases, empowering local communities as agents of change rather than relegating them as passive victims. RVF is a disease with global implication, but it starts at a local level. Therefore, to control zoonotic disease such as RVF, it is important to understand the local communitiesâ€™ knowledge, attitudes and practices related to RVF. Using a bottom-up perspective, we investigated the factors that keep the local community from participating in the control of RVF outbreaks at the interface between humans, animals, and the environment. By devising acceptable and cost-effective interventions, we believe local communities can be encouraged to be the first line of defense against RVF outbreaks. Furthermore, policies aimed at curtailing RVF outbreaks would benefit from involvement of the local communities.
