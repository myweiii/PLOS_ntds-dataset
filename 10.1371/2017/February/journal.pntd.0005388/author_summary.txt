Podoconiosis is an NTD causing chronic leg swelling in subsistence farming communities in the tropics. There is no research on the association between podoconiosis and two common causes of blindness and visual impairment; trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and cataract. TT is the blinding consequence of conjunctival scarring in trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness globally. Cataract is an age-related disease of the lens and remains the leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Both podoconiosis and TT are NTDs endemic to Ethiopia and promote poverty through many factors such as disability, reduced economic productivity and stigma. This comparative cross-sectional study explored the association between podoconiosis and these two eye diseases. We found that podoconiosis patients were burdened with higher levels of blindness and low vision, had higher prevalence of TT and more severe cataract than their matched neighbourhood controls. These findings can help to direct an integrated approach to managing these two NTDs (podoconiosis and TT) and trigger further research in to the wider context of the double burden of eye disease and NTDs.
