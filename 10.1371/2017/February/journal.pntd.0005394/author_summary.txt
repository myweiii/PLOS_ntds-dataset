Many emerging viruses of public health concern are arthropod-borne, including tick-borne encephalitis, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and West Nile viruses. The arboviruses are maintained in nature via virus-specific transmission cycles, involving arthropod (e.g. mosquitos, midges, and ticks) and vertebrate animals (e.g. birds, humans, and livestock). Common to all transmission cycles is the requirement of the arbovirus to replicate in these very different hosts. Since viruses rely on the host cell machinery to produce progeny, the virus particles from these hosts can differ in viral protein glycosylation and lipid content. Thus, the viral inoculum deposited by an infected arthropod will have different properties than virus produced in vertebrate cells. We set out to study the early events of arbovirus infection in a vertebrate host, using the mosquito-borne West Nile virus as a model. Here, we are the first to describe a robust protocol to produce West Nile replicon particles from mosquito cells. Since replicon particles are restricted to a single round of infection, we were able to compare the tropism and spread of the inoculum in animals for mosquito cell- and mammalian cell-derived replicon particles. We found that West Nile replicon particles derived from mosquito cells were significantly reduced in spread to distant sites compared to those derived from mammalian cells. Our results suggest that studies on arbovirus pathogenesis should be conducted with arthropod cell-derived virus, especially for the study of early virus-host interactions.
