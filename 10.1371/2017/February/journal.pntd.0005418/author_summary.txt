E. multilocularis is considered as one of the most lethal parasitic helminth in humans. It grows like tumors mainly in human liver and infiltrates other tissues, and even metastasizes. It is believed that the parasite possesses a population of stem cell-like cells, the germinative cells. These cells are totipotent, have the ability for extensive self-renewal, and drive the parasiteâ€™s development and growth in the host. However, mechanisms controlling the behavior of germinative cells are poorly understood. Here, we show that the highly conserved EGFR/ERK signaling pathway in the parasite promoted germinative cell proliferation upon addition of human EGF (epidermal growth factor) in vitro, resulting in stimulated growth and development of the parasite. Our study provides information important for understanding this mechanism regulating germinative cells and the complex host-parasite interaction, and we hope it will help in developing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human helminthic infections.
