Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an infectious disease present in 75 countries. Brazil is among the six countries that represent over 90% of the cases worldwide. AIDS is an emerging disease present in approximately 190 countries and a major public health problem worldwide due to its magnitude and damage extension. In Brazil, the recent alterations of the AIDS and VL distribution patterns, such as movement of the HIV infection to rural areas and the urbanization of VL associated to the rise of VL cases among the 20â€“49 years old age group, are possible factors associated with an increased risk of the population to present both infections. The coexistence of these diseases enhances the severity, seeing that VL accelerates the development of AIDS in HIV patients, and AIDS increases the risk of VL up to 100 to 1,000 times in endemic areas. Considering that the association of both infections is recent, however rising in several countries, our study contributes to the knowledge of the profile, magnitude and severity of VL/HIV coinfection, which can subsidize actions to overcome challenges related to both VL and AIDS and assist in guiding actions and decision-making processes.
