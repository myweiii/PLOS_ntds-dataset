The 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic was large and widespread, affecting thousands of people across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Prior to this epidemic, there were limited data on persistence of Ebola virus in body fluids of EVD survivors and the potential risk that viral persistence may pose for Ebola virus transmission, including possible sexual transmission. This paper documents the development and implementation of a behavioral counseling protocol to facilitate adoption of risk reduction behaviors among male and female EVD survivors enrolled in the Sierra Leone Ebola Virus Persistence Study. This behavioral counseling protocol, composed of pre-test, delivery of results, and post-test counseling, enabled study staff to translate the study’s body fluid test results into individualized information and preventive action for study participants. Risk reduction behavioral counseling became an important EVD epidemic control measure.
