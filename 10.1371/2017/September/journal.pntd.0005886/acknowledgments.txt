We are grateful to the St Andrews University mass spectrometry facility for collecting and processing mass spectrometry data and to other members of the TKS and GJF groups.
B-THP-T compounds were synthesised by ALF, ERG and MKZ in the laboratory of GJF. Trypanocidal concentrations of compounds were determined by EFK. Target identification and validation experiments were performed by LBT and SKM in the laboratory of TKS.
