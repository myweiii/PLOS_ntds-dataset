In the pursuit of eliminating all species of malaria, Plasmodium vivax presents one of the most substantial challenges, particularly in countries in Asia, the Western-Pacific and South America. This is primarily due to the ability of P. vivax to cause relapse infections months to years after the initial infectious bite. In areas with low levels of malaria transmission, serology has become an increasingly useful tool for surveillance, as anti-Plasmodium antibodies can be detected in individuals long after blood-stage parasites have cleared. In this study, we provide a detailed characterisation of the antibody response generated following P. vivax infection by measuring antibodies to over 300 P. vivax antigens in three different populations in Thailand, Brazil and Papua New Guinea. The individuals in these populations were followed for up to nine months allowing us to estimate the rate at which antibodies decay over time. This improved understanding of the magnitude and dynamics of the antibody response, validated in multiple populations, will contribute to the development of serological surveillance tools needed for enhanced control and elimination of P. vivax.
