The pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei causes the disease melioidosis, which occurs in most tropical regions across the globe. The true burden of melioidosis is unknown but has been predicted to affect 165,000 people every year, resulting in 89,000 deaths. B. pseudomallei is easily confused with its close relative B. ubonensis as both species are frequently found in the same environmental niche and can appear phenotypically identical using serotyping and laboratory culture methods. B. ubonensis is a poorly characterised species but has recently gained interest in the research community as a potential biocontrol agent in B. pseudomallei-endemic regions, and for production of unusual and versatile biocompounds that are now being exploited for industrial applications. B. ubonensis is thought to be non-pathogenic, although other members of the B. cepacia complex to which it belongs are known for their ability to cause clinical disease that can be fatal in immunocompromised patients and people with cystic fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the biology of B. ubonensis to better understand its genetics, genomics, global distribution, virulence potential and antibiotic resistance. We show that this organism is highly genetically diverse, is avirulent in the mouse model, and can naturally encode high levels of meropenem resistance. We also identify B. ubonensis in the Caribbean for the first time, with phylogenomic analysis revealing distinct clades corresponding to geographic origin.
