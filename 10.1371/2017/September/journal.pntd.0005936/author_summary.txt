The European network of National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for equine diseases guarantees West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance and warning of the emergence of the disease. The WNV NRL network has gathered together most of the European countries facing WNV outbreaks. In this context, two inter-laboratory proficiency tests (ILPTs) were designed in 2010 and 2013 to evaluate the network’ and methods’ performances in detecting WNV infection through serology. A comparison of these two ILPTs emphasised a substantial improvement in the analytical performance of the WNV antibody detection tools over the years within the European NRLs network. Nevertheless the serological cross-reactions among related flaviviruses, such as the Japanese encephalitis, Usutu or tick-borne encephalitis viruses through IgG detection, associated with the Virus Neutralisation Tests’ (VNT) lower sensitivity, long duration and need for Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facilities are major concerns related to indirect WNV diagnosis. All these remarks plead in favour of the development and implementation of new technologies to provide alternatives to classical methods for serological flavivirus diagnosis.
