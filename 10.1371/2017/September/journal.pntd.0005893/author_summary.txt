Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne viral disease caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV). During entomological surveillance of SFTSV infection in Korean ticks collected from SFTS outbreak areas, we isolated a single SFTSV strain which we designated KAGWT. In addition, we isolated three SFTSVs from human patients with typical SFTS symptoms. In this study, we report the genomic sequences of each of these isolates and compare the genetic and evolutionary characteristics between tick- and human-derived Korean SFTSV isolates. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of these sequences revealed that the tick-derived Korean SFTSV strain is clustered into genotype B, the most prevalent genotype in South Korea, and was closely related to other SFTSV in the same group. Furthermore, our results show that at least four different genotypes of SFTSV strains are co-circulating in South Korea.
