Chagas' disease and Leishmaniasis are parasitic diseases that affect especially poor people in developing countries. They are caused by the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and different Leishmania species, respectively. According to the World Health Organization they are considered, among others, Neglected Tropical Diseases. The drugs currently in use for the treatment of these parasitoses are not at all effective and have severe drawbacks. Nature has proved to be a rich source of bioactive compounds. Among antiparasitic drugs, the sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin and the alkaloid quinine and their derivatives are used nowadays for human malaria treatment. Sequiterpenes lactones, present mainly in species from Asteraceae family, are interesting compounds due their pharmacological properties. This group of compounds has shown trypanocidal and leishmanicidal activity and are considered as promising leads for antiparasitic drug discovery.
