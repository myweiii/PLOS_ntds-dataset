Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has caused great morbidity, mortality, and use of health service in children younger than five years in China. Recently, effective and safe vaccines against EV71 have been approved. Whether EV71 vaccination should be included as part of China’s routine childhood immunization schedule is unknown. In this study, we built a decision model to evaluate the health impact and cost-effectiveness of a national EV71 vaccination program in China. We find that vaccination would annually avert 567,500 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), 40,000 herpangina cases, 1,093,500 outpatient visits, 95,500 admissions to hospital, 435 deaths, and 14,000 disability adjusted life years based on the current Chinese birth cohort size. The break-even price of the vaccine was $5.2/dose. Within the price range of current routine vaccines paid by the government, a national EV71 vaccination program would be cost-saving or highly cost-effective. Policy makers should consider including EV71 vaccination as part of China’s routine childhood immunization schedule.
