Human and porcine cysticercosis caused by Taenia solium is a parasite disease still endemic in developing countries. The cysts can be located in different host tissues, including different organs of the central nervous system and the skeletal muscles. The molecular mechanisms associated with the tissue localization of the cysts are not well understood. Here, we described the proteome changes of the cysts obtained from different host tissues from infected pigs using quantitative multiplex proteomics. We explored the diversity of host proteins identified in the cyst’s protein extracts and we also explored the immune-localization of several host-related proteins within the cysts, and propose their possible function. We identified several proteins and antigens enriched for a given tissue localization. Several synthetic peptides designed from these tissue-enriched antigens were tested trough ELISA. Using a combination of peptide mixtures and machine learning technologies we were able to distinguish non cysticercotic and cysticercotic pig’s sera. The tissue-enriched proteins/antigens could be useful for the development of improved immuno-diagnostic tests capable of discriminate the tissue-localization of the cysts.
