Whether human pinworm infection plus mebendazole deworming treatment can shift intestinal microbiota to a composition that is beneficial to the host and influence their mucosal immune response is currently unclear. In a cohort of 109 primary school children, we discovered that Enterobius vermicularis infection is associated with increased intestinal microbial diversity, a lowered relative abundance of Fusobacteria and an enriched proportion of Actinobacteria, including the probiotic Bifidobacterium. Mebendazole deworming was found to be correlated with a further increase in bacterial diversity. However, lower gut SIgA levels were detected in the pinworm infected group, and they were increased in only half of the subjects after mebendazole treatment.
