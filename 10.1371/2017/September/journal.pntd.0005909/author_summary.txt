Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel SFTS bunyavirus (SFTSV) with an estimated high case-fatality rate. However, there is no specific antiviral therapy for SFTSV infection. Symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy are the most essential part of case management. It is very important for clinicians to identify critical patients at admission. In this study, we established a simple and feasible scoring system for assessing the severity and predicting the prognosis of SFTS patients with objective parameters. This model may help the physicians to perform intervention measures in advance, control the disease progression and improve the prognosis.
