In this study, we describe the performance testing and diagnostic accuracy assessment of a previously described real-time PCR assay aiming at the validation for early diagnosis of human leptospirosis. We found that diagnostic sensitivity was higher for EDTA whole blood samples (61%) than for serum samples (29%). We demonstrated that the molecular diagnosis was optimal when performed with EDTA whole samples collected within the first 6 days with symptoms, condition in which the sensitivity was 86%. The real-time PCR assay was able to detect leptospiral DNA in EDTA whole blood from 56% of serological non-confirmed cases for whom a convalescent sample was not available. The test overall specificity was 99%. Our findings demonstrate that real-time PCR is a reliable diagnostic tool suited for early diagnosis, and its results could support early medical interventions that could have a decisive impact on clinical outcome and thus decrease both the severity and fatality of cases.
