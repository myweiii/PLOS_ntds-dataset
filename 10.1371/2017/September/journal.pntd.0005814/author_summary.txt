Thiamine is an often-overlooked micronutrient of concern in Cambodia and throughout Southeast Asia, where reports of beriberi are not uncommon due to a diet of thiamine-poor, white, polished rice. Thiamine plays a critical role in cellular energy generation, and also modulates neuronal and neuromuscular transmissions. Thiamine deficiency can progress to beriberi, which can be fatal. Although several recent studies have investigated thiamine status and/or beriberi in the region, this is the first nationally-representative biochemical thiamine data from any country in Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, there is a lack of clinically meaningful cut-offs to interpret these data. Upwards of 10 different cut-offs exist, but many are simply the lower bounds of a reference range, and therefore do not align with clinical symptoms of beriberi. Using the most conservative cut-off from the literature, 27% of mothers and 15% of children were thiamine deficient. More research is required to develop more useful, clinically meaningful thiamine status cut-offs. In addition, given the distinctive peak in Cambodian infant mortality data suggestive of infantile beriberi, immediate action is required to improve the thiamine status in Cambodia, and likely in other countries in Southeast Asia.
