Louse-borne relapsing fever, as the name suggests, is the only relapsing fever transmitted by lice, and caused by the spirochaete Borrelia recurrentis. Today it is endemic to the Horn of Africa, but due to the cosmopolitan nature of the vector, the pathogen still bears epidemic potential to spread globally among vulnerable populations. The most recent account of that has been observed among migrants arriving to Europe in 2015. Up to date, only one strain was sequenced, thus hampering the development of species-specific typing tools. We employed state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing to six B. recurrentis isolates obtained at different time-points and currently available in culture. Our aim was to address the question of genome variability of this pathogen at the highest resolution and provide information necessary for the development of specific typing tools. B. recurrentis has highly conserved genomes, differing in 29â€“38 SNPs compared to the reference genome B. recurrentis A1, all identified outside the loci currently developed and used for relapsing fever Borrelia typing. Therefore, applying these typing methods would render them indistinguishable, while at the SNP level we found a distinction between isolates obtained in 2015 from migrants and the two historical isolates. Our data provide first insights in the genome variability and baseline information necessary for further studies of the molecular epidemiology of the pathogen and for the development of improved diagnostic tools.
