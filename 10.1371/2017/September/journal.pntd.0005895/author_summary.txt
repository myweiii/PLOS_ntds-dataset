Trypanosoma evansi is an important pathogen of the camel and other livestock where it is a causative agent of surra (an economically burdensome disease). The T. evansi is found in Kenya and the rest of the world. This study indicates that T. evansi originated recently from multiple Trypanosoma brucei strains from different genetic backgrounds. This suggests multiple independent evolutionary origins of some complex traits that may have facilitated mechanical transmission in T. evansi and subsequently enabled the parasite to escape the obligate link with the African tsetse fly vector. This evolutionary origin appears to have occurred repeatedly. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of surra, provide recommendations for future work, and indicate a need to consider the risk of horizontal transfer of epidemiologically relevant traits among different Trypanosoma genetic backgrounds in any control campaign. Thus, our study is an important contribution to the field, and represents an important step towards the ultimate aim of trypanosomiasis prevention and/or elimination.
