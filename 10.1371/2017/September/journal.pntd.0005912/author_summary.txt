Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is the causative agent of the life-threatening typhoid fever that affects 11.9â€“20.6 million individuals annually in low-income and middle-income countries. The T-cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a significant role in protection against S. Typhi infection. Yet, the antigens triggering host protective immune responses recognized by these cells are largely unknown. To address this shortcoming, in this study we used an E. coli expression system methodology for identifying immunogenic proteins of S. Typhi. We found that although the pattern of response to individual S. Typhi proteins was variable among the typhoid vaccinees, the E. coli expressing system uncovered the antigen specificity of T-cells, and highlight its applicability to vaccine studies.
