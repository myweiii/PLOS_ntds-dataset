The 2013–2016 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic was unprecedented in the numbers of cases, deaths and survivors. Prior to this epidemic, limited data were available about the persistence of Ebola virus in body fluids of Ebola virus disease survivors and the related risk of transmission, including sexual transmission through survivors’ semen. As more data were urgently needed, a study was implemented in Sierra Leone during the epidemic response operation. When establishing this study, many factors were unknown and the findings needed to be urgently translated into practice. This publication summarizes the methodology used for study implementation and the key lessons learned. Strong community engagement helped rapidly initiate this study despite the difficult circumstances of an overwhelming epidemic in a country with few experienced researchers. Implementation was in two phases, first investigating the persistence of Ebola virus in semen only (100 adult men), and secondly, assessing its persistence in multiple body fluids (semen or vaginal fluid, menstrual blood, breast milk; and urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, tears) of an additional 120 men and 120 women. Data from this study immediately informed national and global guidelines and demonstrated the need for semen testing programs. The lessons learned and study tools developed, supported rapid program implementation in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
