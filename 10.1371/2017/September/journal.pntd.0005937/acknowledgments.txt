Our appreciation goes to the Jane Goodall Institute (through GSRC and TACARE projects) and the Gombe National Park authorities for logistical support during fieldwork. Special thanks go to the people (children and adults) in the studied villages for cooperation and to the Mwamgongo Health Centre in Kigoma District, Tanzania for providing space for laboratory work. We also thank P. Hagan for constructive advice on the study, and an anonymous reviewer, whose comments significantly improved the manuscript.
