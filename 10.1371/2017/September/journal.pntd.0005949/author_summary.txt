Trypanosomes are a major health threat to the people and livestock of Sub-Saharan Africa. Building genomic resources and understanding the genetic structure of these parasites will aid researchers trying to control their spread. To this end, we compared the genomes from 83 trypanosome strains, identifying 162,210 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between them. Our analysis shows high genetic similarity between the trypanosomes, and confirms earlier results indicating that the traditional taxonomic classifications do not correspond well with genetic data. Further, we demonstrate that, despite the high genetic similarity, each strain in the study can be distinguished using as few as 84 SNPs, suggesting that a small number of SNPs can be useful for tracking and classifying populations of African trypanosomes.
