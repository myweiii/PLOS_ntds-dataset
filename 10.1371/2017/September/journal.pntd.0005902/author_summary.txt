The recent resurgence in male-based “rear and release” strategies (release of radiation sterilised males or those harbouring Wolbachia) to control diseases transmitted by urban Aedes mosquitoes, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, has revealed the need for an economical and rapid diagnostic tool to assess the mating competitiveness of released males against wild counterparts for receptive females. Our report details the optimisation of rhodamine B labelling of male seminal fluid and visible body staining via sugar-feeding with no significant impact on survival or mating competitiveness, as well as proof-of-principle field releases. These results reveal rhodamine B labelling to be an economical and rapid evaluation method for male-based control strategies as well as a viable body marking technique for male focused mark-release-recapture experiments without the negative side-effects of traditional marking methods. The use of this method has the potential to enable operators to determine the efficacy of their control method quickly and easily, allowing them to optimise releases to achieve optimal population suppression.
