Ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis causes trachoma. It is the leading infectious cause of blindness, and the target of an international campaign for elimination as a public health problem. Trachoma is endemic to Tarawa, the most populated island of Kiribati, housing approximately half the national population. However, the country has 20 inhabited islands and there were no previous trachoma prevalence data from Kiribati outside Tarawa. We set out to determine the prevalence of trachoma in the second most populated island, Kiritimati, located over 3000 km from Tarawa. In some other Pacific Island countries, ocular C. trachomatis infection is much less prevalent than the clinical signs that are used to guide interventions; we therefore looked for PCR-based evidence of current infection and antibodies to chlamydial proteins, in addition to recording clinical signs of trachoma. Our results indicate that trachoma and ocular C. trachomatis infection are prevalent on Kiritimati, and suggest that interventions are required here. The combined application of antibody, nucleic acid and clinical tools in an intervention-na√Øve population provides insight into their inter-relationships and the data are, therefore, of considerable interest to elimination programmes within and beyond the Pacific.
