The vast majority (95%) of tuberculosis (TB) patients worldwide live in low-income countries, including in West-Africa. Typing the bacteria responsible for TB (tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex) is important for targeted TB control. Typing is usually performed on isolates obtained after the culture isolation of TB bacteria in the sputa from patients. However, cultures can be false negative, and some ‘ancestral’ strains, only found in West-Africa (Mycobacterium africanum), require more time (90 days versus the usual 56 days) to grow in culture. To characterize potential culture bias against such “difficult growers”, we compared the performance of direct typing (on sputum) relative to its yield on culture isolates. We found that ancestral types of TB bacteria were significantly less likely to grow in culture despite the 90-day incubation. This suggests that typing results of cultured isolates are not representative of the diversity in the population of TB bacteria causing disease in patients. Typing sputum directly is effective and can be used for a more precise, unbiased determination of the proportion of different TB bacteria in a population.
