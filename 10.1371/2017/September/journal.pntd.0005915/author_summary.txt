Bleeding is a frequent complication of leptospirosis, a disease caused by the pathogenic spirochaete Leptospira. Although thrombocytopenia is common, studies have shown that it does not fully explain the bleeding events seen in these patients. We hypothesized that platelet dysfunction plays a role in the development of bleeding complications. The present study involved 33 hospitalized patients with probable leptospirosis and 25 healthy controls. We report that circulating platelets from patients with severe, probable leptospirosis were activated, but less reactive to ex vivo activation. The degree of this platelet dysfunction was associated with bleeding, in contrast to the degree of thrombocytopenia. Platelets of leptospirosis patients also demonstrated increased binding with von Willebrand factor (VWF), and a strong negative correlation with platelet count suggesting that this binding is important for platelet clearance.
