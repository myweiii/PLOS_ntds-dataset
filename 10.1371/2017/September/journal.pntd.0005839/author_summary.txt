Soil-transmitted helminthiases, schistosomiasis, and diarrhea remain important public health issues in sub-Saharan Africa. Health educational animated cartoons can help raise awareness and improve hygiene practices, and thus contribute to the control and elimination of these diseases. For the development of an educational animated cartoon, we first evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and beliefs of school-aged children in Côte d’Ivoire regarding soil-transmitted helminthiases, diarrhea, and schistosomiasis in order to identify setting-specific health messages for our animated cartoon. We found that children believed that the consumption of sweet food, eating without washing their hands, sitting on the floor, and eating spoiled food were the main causes of parasitic worm infections. As a next step, the alpha version of the animated cartoon was produced and given the title: “Koko et les lunettes magiques”. The animated cartoon was pre-tested in eight schools and further developed. Our study found that children could retain most of the information provided by the animated cartoon. It is suggested that such a tool, integrated into the school curriculum, together with deworming campaigns in Côte d’Ivoire, might improve the sustainability of control and elimination efforts against soil-transmitted helminthiases, diarrhea, and schistosomiasis.
