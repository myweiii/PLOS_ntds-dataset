Scrub typhus is a mite-transmitted infectious disease that can be life-threatening. Diagnosing this disease is difficult, requiring special techniques that are often not readily available. As the actual impact of scrub typhus on the population and its geographical distribution remains unknown, we searched systematically for available information in medical databases. Scrub typhus is common: more than every fifth person in areas where scrub typhus occurs carry antibodies as a sign of previous contact. All countries with an established surveillance system have recorded an increase in scrub typhus cases over the past 8â€“10 years, while reports from South America and Africa suggest a wider distribution beyond Asia. Scrub typhus is a serious disease: approximately 6% of cases die if untreated, and 1.5% if treated, but mortality can reach 13% in areas where the usual treatment does not always work well. Death rates of complications are higher, reaching 14% in brain infections, 24% with multiple organ failure, and pregnancies with scrub typhus can have poor outcomes, with high miscarriage rates. Despite many limitations on the amount and quality of available reports, we found that scrub typhus is a severely underappreciated tropical disease, affecting mainly rural populations, but increasingly urban areas as well.
