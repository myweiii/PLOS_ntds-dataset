Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is caused by infection with filarial worms that are transmitted by mosquito bites. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis aims to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020. Once elimination targets have been reached, cost-effective surveillance strategies are required to ensure that any areas of ongoing transmission or resurgence are quickly identified and managed. Potential options include the integration of LF surveillance with other public health activities. In American Samoa, blood samples collected in 2010 for a research project on a different disease (leptospirosis) were used to test for evidence of LF infection, and the study found two possible areas of ongoing transmission. We conducted a follow up study in 2014 to verify whether LF infection was truly occurring in these two areas, and found that infection rates in both areas were significantly higher compared to other parts of American Samoa. Our results therefore provide field evidence that integrating LF surveillance activities with other population-based surveys are potentially effective and feasible, and provide a cost-effective method for identifying residual areas of transmission.
