After more than 40 years of use, Praziquantel (PZQ) still remains the drug of choice for the treatment of intestinal and urogenital schistosomiasis. However the relationship between pharmacokinetics and efficacy is not elucidated. For adults infected with intestinal schistosomiasis, a single oral dose of PZQ at 40 mg/kg is generally recommended by the World Health Organisation for preventive chemotherapy programs. By reducing hepatic metabolism with a pan-CYP inhibitor, we studied the systemic plasma exposure relationship versus activity in the Schistosoma mansoni mouse model. For S. mansoni infections where the worms are located in the mesenteric veins, we found that systemic plasma exposure was not predictive of efficacy, whereas estimated portal vein concentration of PZQ acts as a good predictor for the efficacy. This hypothesis was confirmed by pre-treatment of mice with a CYP inducer which led to a ~10 fold decrease in systemic plasma exposure while maintaining the efficacy of PZQ. This implies that the critical parameters are the rate and amount of PZQ absorbed, in order to achieve the required high local concentrations in the mesenteric veins. Therefore in pediatric patients the current dosing regimen of 40 mg/kg may provide suboptimal concentrations and consequently result in lower cure rates in S. mansoni infections.
