Scrub typhus is a disease caused by bacteria that invade cells in our immune system and blood vessels. It is transmitted by mites and is treatable with antibiotics. Unfortunately diagnosis is difficult and requires techniques that are not easily accessible everywhere. Currently, there is no scrub typhus vaccine available. In order to improve diagnostics and vaccine development in future, we need to better understand our immune response against these bacteria. In this study, we developed a test where these bacteria were killed and prepared by a new purification method to stimulate the immune cells in our blood -not antibodies. We evaluated this test in hospitalized patients with scrub typhus disease and also in non-human primates to study the responses over time. The test proved to be very accurate and useful to study natural immune responses, and we found differences in responses in areas where scrub typhus is common, compared to areas where it is not common. This test will allow us to investigate the immune response to scrub typhus more in-depth in the future, and will support the development of better diagnostic tests and vaccines against scrub typhus.
