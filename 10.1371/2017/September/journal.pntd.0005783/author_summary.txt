Chagas disease is caused by a parasite transmitted by insects that infest households living in extreme poverty conditions. The parasite can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy. If detected at birth, the infection can be treated effectively with available drugs. However, access to professional neonatal healthcare is limited in rural communities such as those affected by Chagas disease. We developed a strategy to promote access to a simple neonatal diagnostic test in a rural region of Guatemala considered at risk for Chagas disease. The strategy included collaboration between Health Center personnel, midwives and non-governmental organizations that play a local role in maternal-infant care. During the implementation of a health promotion campaign, screening revealed previous infection in almost one of every 25 pregnant women. Most babies born to positive women were tested at the Health Center for parasites in blood. The implementation of similar strategies to prevent congenital Chagas in other rural areas should consider local maternal-infant care practices. This strategy of collaboration between Ministry of Health, community health workers, non-government organizations, academia and external governmental support could be expanded to screen for other diseases, such as Zika, that require early detection to improve overall infant health.
