The members of the Cryptococcus neoformans / Cryptococcus gattii species complex are the cause of cryptococcosis, a life-threatening human disease responsible for 624,000 deaths annually. Infection is acquired through inhalation of dehydrated yeast cells from environmental sources. After reaching the lungs, the fungus disseminates to the central nervous system causing meningoencephalitis. The majority of meningitis cases in HIV-infected patients are caused by C. neoformans, a species well studied in regions with a high prevalence of HIV infection, such as Asia and Africa. A similar high prevalence has been reported from Brazil however the epidemiology of these infections is less well understood. We studied clinical and environmental isolates from the southeast region of Brazil using MLST. The results that we obtained showed a clonal population structure of C. neoformans var. grubii VNI, with low variability when compared against populations from different continents. This lower variability is probably the result of multiple recent dispersal events from Africa to the Americas. The majority of clinical isolates were of one sequence type (ST93), which was also found in environmental samples. By expanding the analysis to isolates from around the globe, it was possible to identify two major groups among C. neoformans var. grubii VNI.
