Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is endemic in Central and South America, where it affects about 10 million people. In addition, migration has led to the disease being established in non-endemic countries. Infection involves an acute stage that evolves to a chronic stage where infected individuals may or may not show clinical symptoms or suffer progressive heart disease. The relevance of T cells in the control of T. cruzi infection has been demonstrated in human infection and in experimental models. However, the T. cruzi parasite employs different strategies to downregulate the T cell function. These mechanisms can act at the initial time of T cell activation, leading to a state of anergy where lymphocytes do not respond. However, the molecular components that regulate this process during T. cruzi infection are not well understood. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that this T cell hyporesponsiveness could be linked to an increased expression of GRAIL. We propose that GRAIL expression induced by the parasite could be maintained by increased expression of inhibitory molecules, which blocked mTOR activation and IL-2 secretion. GRAIL could then play a key role in downregulating T cell functions by allowing the parasites to establish the chronic disease.
