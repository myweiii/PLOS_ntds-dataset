Canine rabies typically persists in developing countries where stray and unvaccinated, free-roaming domestic dogs account for a substantial proportion of the population. In this paper we investigate whether sustained canine rabies transmission can occur within the wild dog population of Australia, which comprises dingoes and their hybrids with domestic dogs. To do this we simulated the transmission of rabies between wild dogs across a sizeable landscape area. Whenever the disease spread 120 km we considered an epidemic as having occurred and recorded the length of time it took to do so. This allowed us to estimate the probability the sustained transmission of canine rabies will occur (21%) upon its introduction along with the speed at which it will spread (67 km/year). We also determined that wild dog movements and behaviour (for which there is the least amount of information available at present) together with wild dog density are the most important factors influencing these two outcomes, whereas wild dog demography (including average lifespan and average replacement period) had minimal impact. Future research should therefore focus on studying wild dog movements and behaviour to improve Australiaâ€™s readiness to control and prevent canine rabies transmission and establishment.
