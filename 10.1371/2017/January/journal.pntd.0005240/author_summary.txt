About 80% of leishmaniasis infections result in cutaneous manifestations with a broad symptomatic spectrum, ranging from self-healing localized to disseminated lesions. The mechanism behind these latter aggravated forms of leishmaniasis is still poorly understood. One possible factor is an endosymbiotic RNA virus identified in the cytoplasm of several Leishmania species (Leishmania RNA virus 1). LRV1 acts as a virulence factor, causing a destructive hyper-inflammatory response. In this study, we tested the prophylactic potential of a vaccine formulated with a recombinant LRV1 capsid and a T helper 1-polarizing adjuvant. Our approach conferred significant protection against LRV1+ Leishmania guyanensis infection, decreasing lesional inflammation and parasite burden. Further analysis demonstrated that this vaccine induced a potent T helper 1 response. Consequently, we propose that the LRV1-capsid is a promising vaccine component in order to reduce clinical complications (e.g. symptomatic relapses) in areas endemic to LRV1 co-infected Leishmania species. Taken together, we present an original strategy, whereby targeting the pervasive intracellular viruses within pathogens may reduce pathologic inflammation and offer an extra-genetic candidate that may circumvent escape mutations or poor response to drug treatment.
