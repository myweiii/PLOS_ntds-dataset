People’s living conditions are a crucial factor for health and diseases. In developing countries like Cameroon, poverty is a major condition affecting the way people deal with health issues. We studied people’s a health-seeking behaviour action in two settings: camps, housing labourers of the Cameroon Development Cooperation, and campuses, places where students of the state universities of Buea and Yaoundé reside. We interviewed 21 camp dwellers and 21 students about their health challenges and responses. The results show health challenges not only relate to exposure to diseases but also to the reliability, affordability and functionality of medical services, the hygienic conditions in the living environment and money. For treatment of common diseases, foremost malaria and typhoid, the last resort was going to a clinic or hospital. More prominent responses were cleaning and other hygienic measures, self-medication using available tablets, herbs or other traditional medicine, consultation at small pharmacies or unofficial ‘doctors’. Public health services should anticipate people’s health behaviour to better address the health challenges of people living in poor conditions.
