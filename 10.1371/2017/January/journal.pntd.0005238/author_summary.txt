The outcome of Chikungunya virus infection is usually benign but persistent arthritis has been reported in 10â€“20% of patients after Chikungunya fever. However, some reports have suggested that similarity between host proteins and viral proteins (molecular mimicry) leads to immune mediated damage. However, this has not been proved conclusively. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify if molecular mimicry exists between CHIKV and host components. Using various bioinformatics tools we identified common sequences and structural homology between glycoprotein of the virus and two human host tissue proteins- HLA-B27 molecule and a domain of complement C3. Two peptides having homology to these human tissue components were synthesized. These peptides were recognized by antibodies present in serum of CHIKV patients. Experiments were conducted to investigate if the peptides were capable of inducing pathology in an experimental C57BL/6J mouse model. Both the peptides on their own were able to induce significant inflammation in the muscles of C57BL/6J mice similar to that observed in animals that were injected with CHIKV alone. Additionally, animals that were injected initially with CHIKV followed by a subsequent injection of the two CHIKV peptides exhibited increased pathology as compared to animals that were injected with peptides or virus alone.
