Severe forms of dengue fever (DF) are usually considered as a pediatric disease in southern Asia and are graded from dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) to dengue with shock syndrome (DSS). However, the age of affected individuals is increasing in Singapore, Thailand, Mainland China, Taiwan and many other countries. Limited data are available on the elderly with DF in intensive care units (ICUs). DF in the elderly is an emerging infectious disease and poses a new clinical challenge to physicians. We enrolled the patients with laboratory-confirmed dengue in our ICU during the 2015 dengue outbreak in Taiwan. These patients were characterized by old age, multiple comorbidities, and a high case fatality rate (CFR). All of the patients were classified as severe dengue, and the in-hospital CFR was 41.3%. Renal failure and cardiac arrest were associated with fatality. In addition to organ failure, initial prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in our study was consistent with an independent predictive factor for in-hospital fatality. Previous studies have also reported that prolongation of APTT is a clinical predictor of dengue virus infection (DENV) or DHF. Our results highlight that APTT prolongation may be a prognostic factor in critically ill adults with severe dengue.
