Schistosomiasis is caused by blood flukes residing in the veins of infected individuals and afflicts millions of people in the developing world. The schistosome worms can remain healthy in the bloodstream for more than 10 years, implying an extraordinary ability to evade host immune damage. Scientists are seeking to understand immune evasion so as to find weaknesses in defenses that can be exploited in the development of effective vaccines. Here we investigate the normal antibody response to schistosomes during infection of mice, rats and humans, and show for the first time that this response is highly skewed to the recognition of a small number of proteins present at the worm surface. Surprisingly, these abundant antibodies recognize their targets only when the proteins retain their native conformations, stabilized by the presence of intramolecular disulfide bridges. Because of this conformational-dependence, these antibodies have remained undetected in prior studies in which antibody binding assays were routinely performed in a reducing environment that destroys disulfide bridges. The routine presence of these antibodies within the serum of schistosome infected patients and animals raises new and interesting questions as to their possible role in immune evasion, and has significant implications for schistosomiasis vaccine development.
