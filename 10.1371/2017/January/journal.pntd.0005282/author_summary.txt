Taenia solium is a cestode that infects humans and pigs. The parasite causes up to one-third of epilepsy in Latin America, Asia and Africa and results in economic harm to smallholder farmers who cannot sell the contaminated pork of their infected pigs. “Ring-strategy” is an intervention being evaluated as a potential method to control the spread of infection within communities. This strategy involves identifying heavily infected pigs and targeting treatment resources to humans and pigs living nearby these animals. Tongue examination of pigs is used to provide a simple yet crude technique for identifying the most heavily infected pigs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of ultrasonography to identify T. solium infection in pigs and to compare it to traditional tongue examination methods. We found that ultrasonography may be better at detecting heavily infected pigs than traditional tongue examination methods, but has limitations such as increased cost and a high false positive rate. With improvements in training and greater operator experience, ultrasound may have the potential to contribute to control interventions based on ring-strategy.
