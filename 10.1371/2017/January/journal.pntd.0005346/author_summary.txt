Powassan virus (POWV) is a neuroinvasive tick-borne flavivirus (TBFV), which causes life-threatening encephalitis in humans in North America and Europe. The virus is persistently maintained in a natural cycle involving infected ixodid ticks and small-to-medium sized mammals, such as mice, woodchucks and skunks. Despite conclusive evidence showing that wild rodents play an important role in the maintenance of TBFVs in nature, very little is known regarding the relationship between POWV and its natural mammalian hosts. We selected Peromyscus leucopus, one of the most abundant mixed forest rodent in the USA, as a natural host model for studying POWV infection. Challenging this mouse species with POWV via different routes of inoculation did not result in obvious clinical signs of disease, suggesting resistance, which may be associated with virus restriction factors. The model will be useful for studies aimed at understanding how the animals restrict POWV without clinical signs of disease.
