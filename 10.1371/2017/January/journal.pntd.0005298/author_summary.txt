The parasite Trypanosoma cruzi can cause Chagas disease in humans and dogs. The parasite is typically spread through the feces of a blood-sucking ‘kissing bug’ insect. Despite many documented cases in dogs across Texas, there are few population-level research studies investigating canine Chagas disease in multi-dog kennels in Texas. We sampled a total of 86 dogs from three kennels in south central Texas. We found 58% of the dogs had antibodies indicating they had been exposed to the parasite, and 17% of the dogs had parasite DNA circulating in their blood. We found that over 80% of kissing bugs collected from the kennels were infected. Further, using a bloodmeal analysis technique, we detected that all tested bugs had recently fed on dog blood. Our findings indicate that dog kennels can serve as an environment where kissing bugs and dogs interact, and that outdoor, multi-dog kennels in areas with kissing bugs are high risk areas for Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in dogs.
