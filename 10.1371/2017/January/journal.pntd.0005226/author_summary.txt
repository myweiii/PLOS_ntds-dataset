Rift Valley Fever is an acute zoonotic viral disease caused by Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) that affects ruminants and humans in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. We used phylogenetic approaches that take sampling date into account to understand the demographic history of RVFV populations, using sequence data from the three minigenomic segments of the virus. We found evidence of broad circulation of the virus in East Africa, with many lineages originating in Kenya, with single and multiple introductions of RVFV among countries. The overall picture of RVFV history is thus one of considerable mobility, and dynamic evolution and biogeography, emphasizing its invasive potential, potentially more broadly than its current distributional limits.
