Chikungunya virus is an alpha-virus transmitted by Aedes egyptii or albopictus bites. This infection is still considered as an emerging public health problem. In the acute stage of infection, typical physical signs of Chikungunya virus infection are febrile illness associated with severe and debilitating polyarthralgia affecting the small joints. Several studies have shown that mortality rates increased during the outbreak. Age over 85 years has been shown to be associated with increased mortality, and the mortality rate is higher in 65+ subjects than among younger population. During epidemics, prevalence rates vary from 18% to 48%. Rapid and reliable diagnosis is required especially for frail elderly population. Diagnosis based solely on physical examination may underestimate the magnitude of the epidemic. The systematic use of biological diagnosis during an outbreak is not feasible, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The use of predictive scores would thus be very helpful in this situation.
