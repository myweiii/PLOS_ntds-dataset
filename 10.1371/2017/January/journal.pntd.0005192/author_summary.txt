Leprosy is caused by bacteria that affects nerves, causing deformities. These deformities are preventable through early detection and prompt treatment. India reports more than 60% of worldâ€™s leprosy burden, of which new case with deformities is at increasing trend in the recent years, which is a public health issue. However, long delay in diagnosis have reported. In this study, we observed that patient delay is larger than health care provider delay. Many patients were ignorant of early symptoms of leprosy. In addition, we observed that limited community activities and misdiagnosis appears to be contributing to overall delay in diagnosis in areas of Maharashtra, India. Although more research on this subject should be conducted, this study highlights a need for further educational interventions for both patients and training for doctors.
