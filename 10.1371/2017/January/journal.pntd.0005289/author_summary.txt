The five most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and trachoma. They can be controlled or eliminated by means of safe and cost-effective interventions delivered through programs of Mass Drug Administration (MDA)—also named Preventive Chemotherapy (PCT).The WHO defined targets for NTD control/elimination by 2020, reinforced by the 2012 London Declaration, which, if achieved, would result in benefits not limited to health gains. We estimated the potential economic benefit of achieving these targets for these NTDs. Economic benefit was calculated by combining the estimated disease frequency with productivity loss resulting from the disease, from the perspective of a person affected by each of the NTDs. The same was done for the healthcare costs paid by the affected individuals. The economic benefit to individuals from productivity gain was estimated to be I$ 251 billion in 2011–2020 (before achieving the targets) and I$ 313 billion in 2021–2030 (after achieving the targets). The estimated total healthcare costs averted are substantial though lower than productivity costs: $0.72 billion in 2011–2020, $0.96 billion in 2021–2030. This would mean a return of US$ 27.4 for each dollar spent between 2015–2020 to reach the targets and US$ 42.8 between 2021–2030. The economic impact varies between NTDs and regions, since it is determined by disease prevalence and the degree of productivity loss caused by the disease.
