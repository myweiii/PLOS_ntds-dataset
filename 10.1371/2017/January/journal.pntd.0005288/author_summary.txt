Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in nature and they are opportunistic pathogens. In the last decade, infections caused by NTM’s increased—around the world in immune-suppressed and immune-competent individuals and Saudi Arabia is not an exception. Developments in diagnostic technologies increased the identification of several new or rare species of NTM’s. Indeed, the species diversity of NTM has a direct impact on clinical outcome and therapies. Saudi Arabian clinics so far report only the common species of NTM’s and rare species are mostly neglected due to the lack of proper infrastructure or ignorance. To the first time in the country, an exploration on the existence of clinically relevant rare NTM species was conducted on a nationwide level. The findings showed a huge diversity of rare NTM species causing both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases. Clinical relevance of pulmonary infection based on American Thoracic Society guidelines was confirmed as an aggressive 75%, which is really alarming. Interestingly, 16 species of NTM’s were isolated in the study, and all of them are reporting for the first time in country. Overall finding shows Saudi Arabia faces serious threat from rare NTM species with high clinical significance and warrants the immediate need for more advanced infrastructure.
