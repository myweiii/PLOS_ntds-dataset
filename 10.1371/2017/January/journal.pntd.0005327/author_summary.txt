Informed consent is an essential element of the ethical conduct of clinical trials of new vaccines, regardless of the study setting. However, the quality of informed consent is often suboptimal. Some research has suggested that the quality of the informed consent process may be reduced in resource-limited areas compared to developed country settings. To test this, we conducted a study of the quality of the informed consent process in two similar Phase 1 clinical trials of the Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel hookworm vaccine that were conducted in healthy adult volunteers in Brazil and in the United States. In Brazil, the trial was conducted at two sites, one a large urban area (Belo Horizonte), and the other a rural, resource-limited region of the state of Minas Gerais; in the United States, the trial was conducted in Washington, DC. A structured questionnaire was administered after the informed consent document was signed at each of the three clinical trial sites, which tested understanding about the information contained in the document and attitudes toward the volunteersâ€™ participation in the clinical trial. The results indicate that there were no substantial differences between the overall quality of the informed consent obtained from participants in the United States and in Brazil. However, a significant association was found between the particular site where the trial was conducted and the quality of the informed consent process, with residents of the site in rural Brazil having the lowest percentage of correct answers on the informed consent questionnaire. The informed consent process should therefore take into account the specific characteristics of the population in which the trial is being conducted.
