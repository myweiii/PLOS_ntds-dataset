Infection with the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus is the cause of river blindness. We analyzed the immune response against this parasite in infected individuals in order to identify linear epitopes. Using high-density peptide microarrays we discovered three immunodominant motifs in the Onchocerca volvulus proteome that induce a broad IgG response, but the typical IgG4 immune response against parasites was absent. Our study led to the identification of novel potential epitope sequences that can potentially be used for detection of infection with Onchocerca volvulus.
