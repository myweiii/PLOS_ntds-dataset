Yaws and trachoma are infectious diseases targeted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for eradication and elimination as a public health problem, respectively. Both diseases are found in the rural, isolated and underserved communities of the world’s poorest countries. The WHO strategy for trachoma elimination includes Mass Drug Administration (MDA) of the antibiotic azithromycin, with population-based prevalence surveys required to determine where interventions are needed. As yaws can also be treated with azithromycin, in co-endemic areas, azithromycin MDA will likely treat both infections. We conducted an integrated trachoma and yaws prevalence survey in establish the prevalence of both diseases in the 5 northern-most provinces of Vanuatu. The estimated prevalence of trachomatous inflammation—follicular (TF, a sign of C. trachomatis infection) in children aged 1–9 years was 12.0%, and the estimated prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis (TT, advanced, potentially blinding disease) in adults aged 15 years and above was 0.04%. Two children had yaws, giving an estimated prevalence of active yaws in those aged 5–14 years of 0.2%. Mass treatment with azithromycin is recommended in these provinces. Given the apparent low burden of yaws, integration of yaws and trachoma control programmes is likely to be useful and cost-effective to national programmes.
