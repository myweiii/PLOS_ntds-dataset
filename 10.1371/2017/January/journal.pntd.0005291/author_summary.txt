Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important cause of diarrheal illness in infants and young children in the developing world, as well as in individuals traveling to endemic areas. Due to the lack of suitable animal models for human ETEC infection, we performed a human challenge study in which volunteers ingested wild-type ETEC in a controlled clinical setting. In addition to closely monitoring their clinical status, we studied their ETEC-specific T cell responses prior to and after challenge and studied the presence of associations between CD4+ T cell responses and clinical outcome. We observed differences in the immunological responses of individuals who developed moderate to severe diarrhea following challenge compared to those who did not. These results indicate that T cells may be an important component of the immune response against ETEC.
