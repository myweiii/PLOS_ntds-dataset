Diarrhea is a major public health problem in developing countries, especially in Africa, but the causative agents are often unknown, impeding the implementation of appropriate therapeutic measures. Although pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica are a frequent cause of gastroenteritis in developed countries, reports of human yersiniosis are scarce in West Africa. We performed this study to determine whether this pathogen was present in pigs (the natural reservoir of this bacterium) in various swine farms of the Abidjan district, and whether it was causing human gastro-intestinal infections. We show here that this bacterium is indeed circulating among Ivorian pigs and is causing human digestive disorders with a frequency similar to that reported in developed countries. The paucity of reports of this infection in African countries may be explained by the difficulty of isolating Y. enterocolitica from stools and the need for specific and time-consuming procedures. During this study we also made the unexpected observation that some Ivorian strains have acquired the capacity to mutate at a much higher frequency than normal strains. This property may render them better fitted to new environments, more virulent to their host, or capable of resisting some commonly used treatments, which could be of great public health concern.
