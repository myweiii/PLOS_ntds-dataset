The ecology of plague is complex and its epidemiology is enigmatic. Many different flea species are able to transmit Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, and they can transmit in two different ways. Early-phase transmission can occur during the first week after a flea has fed on a diseased animal. Thereafter, transmission occurs only as bacterial growth in the flea foregut interferes with and eventually blocks blood feeding. Comparisons of the relative ability of different flea vectors to transmit have been problematic, and contradictory results have been reported for the ability of the ground squirrel flea Oropsylla montana to transmit beyond the early phase. Our results show that O. montana readily develops foregut blockage, and transmission by that mechanism was as good as or better than observed for Xenopsylla cheopis, a flea known to block at a high rate. In contrast, very few bacteria were transmitted in the early phase by either of these fleas compared to later times after infection, suggesting that early-phase transmission is pertinent only to highly susceptible animals. Improved characterization of the transmission patterns of different flea vectors will aid in modeling plague incidence in its various natural settings.
