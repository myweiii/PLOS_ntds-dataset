Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease of global impact. In Venezuela, dengue is endemic with the co-circulation of the 4 viral serotypes and has become one of the most important public health problems of urban areas. During 2010 and 2011, a baseline cross-sectional study was carried out as part of a dengue prospective cohort study. We enrolled 2012 individuals aged 5â€“30 years living in 840 households within 3 neighbourhoods in Maracay, one of the cities with the highest number of reported dengue cases in Venezuela. Serological data were obtained through blood sample collections prior to informed consent. Analyses of risk-maps at a fine scale were carried out to detect dengue seroprevalence hot spots (areas of greater transmission) within these neighborhoods and to relate them with potential transmission risk factors. Recent dengue infection clustered within and around households and blocks (radius 20-110m), suggesting the relevant spatial scale at which disease transmission occurs in the studied area. People that lived within these hot spots were poorer and had more man-made potential mosquito breeding sites in and around their premises. Focalizing dengue control measures to infection high risk zones may result in a more cost effective approach of dengue surveillance and control. Spatial statistics analyses are powerful tools to identify the past and the actual distribution of dengue, localize high risk areas and help focalizing control measures.
