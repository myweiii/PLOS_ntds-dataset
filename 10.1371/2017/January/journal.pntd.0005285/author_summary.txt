Currently, more than 10 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV-1, the first discovered human oncogenic retrovirus. Up to 7% of infected individuals experience during their life a severe form of T cell malignancy or a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the nervous system designated HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). At present, there is no resolutive therapy for both of these diseases. In HAM/TSP patients, besides classical neurological signs and the degree of proviral load, no specific virus-related biomarker has been defined that unambiguously distinguishes infected cells of HAM/TSP from those of asymptomatic carriers or ATL patients. Here for the first time, we present evidence that an HTLV-1 protein, designated HBZ, previously found expressed only in the nucleus, is indeed exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HAM/TSP patients and almost exclusively in the CD4+ T cell compartment without the need that these cells co-express the Treg-associated marker CD25. This finding establishes an association between development of the inflammatory HAM/TSP disease and presence of a viral product in the cytoplasm, opening new ways to understand the molecular basis of the HTLV-1-mediated pathogenesis of this severe form of neuromyelopathy.
