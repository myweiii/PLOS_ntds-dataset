A number of orthobunyaviruses such as Oropouche virus, La Crosse virus and Schmallenberg virus are important global human or animal pathogens transmitted by arthropod vectors. Further understanding of the antiviral control mechanisms in arthropod vectors is key to developing novel prevention strategies based on preventing transmission. Antiviral small RNA pathways such as the exogenous siRNA and piRNA pathways have been shown to mediate antiviral activity against positive-strand RNA arboviruses, but information about their activities against negative-strand RNA arboviruses is critically lacking. Here we show that in Aedes aegypti-derived mosquito cells, the antiviral responses to mosquito-borne orthobunyaviruses is largely mediated by both siRNA and piRNA pathways, whereas the piRNA pathway plays only a minor role in controlling midge-borne orthobunyaviruses. This suggests that vector specificity is in part controlled by antiviral responses that depend on the host species. These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of arbovirus-vector interactions.
