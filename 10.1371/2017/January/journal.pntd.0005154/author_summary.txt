Yaws is a tropical infection caused by a bacterium closely related to that which causes syphilis. It is transmitted from person to person through skin to skin contact and often causes papillomatous and ulcerative skin lesions, usually in young children. Without treatment, it can lead to deformities and disabilities. In the past, treatment of cases and their contacts and mass treatment of whole communities has been conducted using single doses of long acting penicillin. This treatment is inexpensive and does not pose a problem with adherence. However, the injections are painful and make it difficult to gain the cooperation of children. In addition, it requires trained health workers to safely administer treatment in poor-resource settings where yaws commonly occurs. In this study one group of children aged 1â€“15 years with clinically and serologically confirmed yaws received the standard treatment of a single injection of benzathine penicillin. A second group of children were treated with a single dose of oral azithromycin. The children were followed up at 3 weeks to assess healing of lesions, and at 3 and 6 months respectively to monitor serological indicators of infection. Our conclusion is that single dose oral azithromycin is as effective as a single injection of benzathine penicillin for the treatment of early yaws in Ghana and confirms the findings of a previous study undertaken in Papua New Guinea.
