Rabies is a deadly disease of human and animals. The disease has been recognized in Ethiopia for centuries, but its impact remained underestimated. This limitation masks the true magnitude of rabies incidence and has been a stumbling block for its prevention and control. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of human rabies exposure in Northwestern Tigray, Ethiopia, where studies have not been conducted, although outbreaks of the disease were common. A health facility-based four year referent study was conducted on human rabies exposure cases recorded from 2012 to 2015 at Suhul hospital, located in Shire Endaselase, Northwestern Zone of Tigray. Majority of the exposed cases were males. The most exposed age group was â‰¥15 years in all the study years. Similarly, exposure cases increased with age in both male and female individuals across the study years. Incidence of human rabies exposure cases per 100,000 populations also showed a continuous increment with the highest being recorded in 2014. Moreover, the study discovered the highest annual human rabies exposure incidence in Ethiopia. This suggests an urgent need for synergistic efforts of human and animal health sectors to implement prevention and control strategies.
