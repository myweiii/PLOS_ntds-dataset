Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. JEV is maintained in a cycle involving mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, mainly pigs and wading birds. Humans can be infected when bitten by an infected mosquito. Culex tritaeniorhynchus is the main vector of the disease in tropical and subtropical areas. The recent detection of JEV in birds and mosquitoes collected in Northern Italy has led us to evaluate the putative emergence of this arboviral disease in Europe. For this purpose, we have tested the competence of European populations of Cx. pipiens and Aedes albopictus to transmit this virus in a laboratory setting. We showed that these local mosquitoes could be infected and were capable of transmitting a pathogenic virus to mice. It is thus urgent to evaluate the risks of JEV emergence in European regions displaying a favorable environment for mosquito vectors, susceptible pigs and wading birds.
