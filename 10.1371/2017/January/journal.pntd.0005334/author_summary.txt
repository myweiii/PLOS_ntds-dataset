Since 2014, Brazil has experienced simultaneous transmission of dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), hampering clinical differentiation of infections due to the close manifestations caused by these viruses. Salvador, Brazilâ€™s third largest city, was one of the cities most affected by those arboviral diseases. While a large acute exantematous illness (AEI) outbreak attributed to ZIKV has been recognized in the city, transmission of CHIKV appeared to have been much less intense. To obtain a comprehensible overview of the recent epidemiological situation, we investigated the proportion of chikungunya positive results among Salvador residents that were tested for CHIKV infections from November 2014 to April 2016. We demonstrated a high rate of CHIKV detection in serum samples during June-November 2015, shortly after an AEI outbreak attributed to ZIKV. The increase in CHIKV cases was not promptly detected by public health authorities and health professionals, likely because all the attention was directed to the ZIKV outbreak and its ensuing complications. It is important for regions that harbor Ae. aegypti (and potentially other vectors), but have not yet been subject to much transmission of ZIKV, CHIKV, DENV (and to potential other new and emerging arbovirus), to be prepared for the potential co-circulation of these viruses and associated diagnostic challenges.
