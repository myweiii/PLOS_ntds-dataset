Resolving patterns of mosquito dispersal across landscapes is a critical step toward the development of effective control strategies that mitigate vector-borne disease transmission and its public health burden. Here, we used a recently developed technique involving the enrichment of aquatic larval habitat with stable isotopes to mark male and female mosquitoes of two important vector species, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. We show that the patterns of dispersal were fundamentally different between these urban vectors. Culex quinquefasciatus dispersed much further than Aedes albopictus. In addition, male Aedes albopictus dispersed further than female mosquitoes. Our study suggests that infectious disease agents transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus will be more difficult to control locally than those transmitted by Aedes albopictus. Our results on sex-biased dispersal in Aedes albopictus have implications for next-generation vector control strategies that rely on the release of sterile or sterilizing males to control mosquito populations. Finally, our study continues to show the utility of the stable-isotope marking technique to study mosquito movement.
