We also thank our team of graduate and undergraduate students that worked on this project as both field and lab technicians: Chris Madeira, Michael Sanders, Andrew Golnar, Chris Tarrand, Sarah Noe, and Tim Foreman. Bret Collier provided valuable discussion and guidance on modeling mark-capture data. Texas A&M University's Department of Soil and Crop Sciences provided weather station data. We appreciate the constructive reviews provided by two anonymous reviewers.
