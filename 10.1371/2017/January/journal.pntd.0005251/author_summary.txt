An estimated 99% of people with Chagas disease do not receive treatment. I interviewed 63 patients with a diagnosis of Chagas disease at a rural clinic in an endemic area of Bolivia. Only 4 had obtained biomedical treatment. Although the departmental government provided free medication for Chagas disease, this was not typically available for adults in patientsâ€™ communities, and additional costs such as consultations and cardiologic examinations were prohibitively expensive for this marginalized population. Travel distances and contradictory messages from providers also made it difficult for patients to access treatment. Furthermore, patients believed strong emotions would worsen the symptoms of their Chagas disease, yet often felt anguished or worried when diagnosed. To deal with the emotional impact of the disease and restore normalcy to their lives, patients adopted a strategy of remaining calm and minimizing worries about Chagas disease. This is not fatalism or resignation, but a pragmatic strategy patients utilize to feel more in control of the disease. Treatment programs need to consider the emotional and social implications of Chagas disease in addition to addressing structural barriers which impede treatment.
