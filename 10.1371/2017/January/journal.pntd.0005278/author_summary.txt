The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects at least 5 to 10 million individuals worldwide. In Australo-Melanesia, a south Pacific region including Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu archipelago and Australia, previous studies have shown that HTLV-1 is present in limited remote areas among few ancient Aboriginal populations. The molecular characterization of the HTLV-1 viruses present in such Indigenous individuals indicates that they belong to a specific HTLV-1 genotype called the Australo-Melanesian subtype c. In the present study, we provide evidence that the HTLV-1 endemicity among elderly individuals from New Caledonia is low and quite similar to Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, yet very different to the situation encountered in Central Australia. Furthermore, the newly described full-length HTLV-1 genomic sequences, from two Melanesian natives from New Caledonia and Vanuatu, both belong to the HTLV-1c genotype but are distinct from those of Aboriginal individuals living in neighboring countries. These results suggest that HTLV-1 viral strains were probably introduced among Melanesian native populations during multiple ancient human migration events to these archipelagos.
