Chagas disease (CD) affects an estimated 300,000 people in the United States, but warning signs for the disease have not been closely studied. CD is usually acquired in Latin America, and can remain in the body for years or decades without producing any symptoms. However, in about 30% of patients, it can eventually result in heart failure and death. The electrocardiogram can detect potential heart problems before patients begin to feel symptoms, providing an early warning. If patients with CD receive monitoring and treatment in time, it may prevent the development of more serious heart problems. We checked for the presence of CD in a sample of 327 patients with abnormal electrocardiogram readings, all of whom had resided in Latin America for at least 12 months. Seventeen patients, or 5.2% of the total sample, were positive for CD. Our study discusses the association of different electrocardiogram readings with CD in the United States, and explores variations based on patientsâ€™ gender and country of origin. The electrocardiogram can be a valuable tool for detecting and measuring the progression of CD in patients from Latin America so that proper treatment can be offered.
