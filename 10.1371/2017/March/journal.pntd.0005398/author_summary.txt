Schistosomiasis is the second most widespread human tropical parasitic disease after malaria. It is caused by flatworms of the genus Schistosoma, and poses a considerable threat for human health in numerous Asian, African and South American countries. The World Health Organization has set the goal of eradicating schistosomiasis by 2025. However, no vaccine is available, and we currently have only one drug (praziquantel) that can effectively and efficiently treat the disease. As treatment by mass drug administration would enhance the risk of drug resistance in schistosome parasites, complementary strategies to fight this parasitic disease are urgently needed. Freshwater snails of the Biomphalaria genus act as intermediate hosts in the transmission of the schistosome species. Thus, learning more about the mechanisms of the interaction between these snails and the schistosomes could critically facilitate the identification of potential new candidate molecules that may be targeted to prevent schistosome transmission in the field.
