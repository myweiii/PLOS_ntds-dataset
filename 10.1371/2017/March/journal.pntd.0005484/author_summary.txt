The use of conventional microbiological methods gave us the opportunity to investigate the richness of symbiotic bacteria that inhabit the gut of P. perniciosus during its main period of activity. Our results were subsequently analyzed in the framework of what has been done on sand flies microbiota in order to validate our results and to address the question of the definition of the core bacterial microbiota of sand flies. A meta-analysis on the respective gut microbiota of Old and New World sand flies shows that the majority of bacterial species is observed only in one host whereas less than 8% are shared by more than two hosts. Our results pinpoint the need for a more exhaustive understanding of the microbiota composition and dynamic in phlebotominae, with the aim to implement new biological approaches for the control of sand fly populations in order to prevent Leishmania transmission.
