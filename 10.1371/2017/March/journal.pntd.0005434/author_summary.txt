Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum (TEN) is an uncultivable pathogenic treponeme that causes bejel (endemic syphilis), a chronic human infection mostly affecting children under 15 years of age, occurring mainly in several African and Middle East countries. In this work, we characterized a TEN 11q/j isolate from France that was obtained from an adult male with genital lesions, who was suspected of having syphilis and who received benzathine penicillin G. DNA sequencing of the isolate revealed two loci that were, rather than to TEN, related either to T. pallidum subsp. pertenue or to T. pallidum subsp. pallidum and likely resulted from recombination events. The recombination event in TP0488 as well as the recombination in TP0548, of the 11q/j, helped clarify the phylogeny of the TEN strains indicating that the recombination in TP0548 took place in a treponeme that was ancestral of Bosnia A and Iraq B, but was not an ancestor of the 11q/j isolate. In contrast, a recombination event in TP0488 appeared in the ancestor of the 11q/j isolate after separation of the ancestral treponeme of Bosnia A and Iraq B. This case also points to a possible role of TEN strains in development of syphilis-like lesions in countries with endemic syphilis.
