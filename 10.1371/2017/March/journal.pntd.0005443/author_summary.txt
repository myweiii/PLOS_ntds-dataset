Schistosomiasis, a severe disease caused by parasites of the genus Schistosoma, is prevalent in 74 countries in the Middle-east, Africa, South America and South-East Asia, and affects more than 250 million people, particularly children. Praziquantel is the most effective anti-schistosome drug and is the mainstay of mass drug administration (MDA) programs. However, concerns about the emergence of drug-resistant parasites or reduced efficacy have highlighted the urgent need for an efficacious vaccine that could interfere with parasite establishment and transmission. Here we examine the immunogenicity and vaccine potential of functionally active recombinant forms of the gut-derived cysteine peptidases of S. mansoni, cathepsin B1 (SmCB1) and cathepsin L3 (SmCL3), alone, or in combination. We demonstrate their capacity to induce high levels (>60%) of protection without the need of adjuvant against challenge infection with S. mansoni cercariae. A vaccine that combined SmCB1 and SmCL3 with another secreted molecule, S. mansoni glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (SG3PDH), induces predominant type 2 immune responses, and consistently evokes superior protection (>70%) against S. mansoni challenge infection in both outbred CD-1 mice and hamsters. This efficacious adjuvant-free cysteine peptidase-based vaccine should be brought forward into trials in non-human primates for assessment as a prospective vaccine against human schistosomiasis.
