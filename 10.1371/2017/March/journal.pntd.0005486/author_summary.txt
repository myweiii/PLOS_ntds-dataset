Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a systemic, and most severe form of leishmaniasis. Soluble CD163 (sCD163) levels can serve as biomarker for disease severity in several inflammatory disorders. However, no linkage has been reported for its relationship with Leishmania infections. We now demonstrate, for the first time, that sCD163 is increased in VL patients, and its presence is directly correlated to clinical parameters of disease severity. In vitro infection of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils with L. infantum and L. amazonensis induces, while BCG reduce the expression of CD163 on macrophage surface Furthermore, presence of sCD163 is reduced during clinical improvements. Taken together, results reveal an important role for sCD163 in immune modulation during disease progression, and suggest a potential role as biomarker for determining disease severity and clearance.
