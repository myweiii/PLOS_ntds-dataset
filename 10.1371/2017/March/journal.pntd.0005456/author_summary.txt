High-dose intravenous benzylpenicillin is an effective treatment for neurosyphilis although it can cause potentially life-threatening drug-induced neutropenia. We investigated the incidence, presentation, management and prognosis of benzylpenicillin-induced neutropenia among neurosyphilis patients treated over a three year period at the Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital. We recruited 578 patients with neurosyphilis who received benzylpenicillin (4 megaunits intravenously every 4 hours for 14 days) according to strict study criteria. For patients without medical co-morbidities, the total incidence of benzylpenicillin-induced neutropenia was 2.42% (95% CI: 1.38–4.13%). The incidence of mild, moderate and severe neutropenia was1.56% (95% CI: 0.76–3.04%), 0.52% (95% CI: 0.13–1.64%), and 0.35% (95% CI: 0.06–1.39%), respectively. The duration of therapy given before the onset of neutropenia ranged from 10 to 14 days, and cumulative doses of benzylpenicillin varied from 240 to 324 megaunits. The accompanying symptoms were tolerated and often normalized within one week under close monitoring of blood counts. Therefore, benzylpenicillin can be continued with surveillance in the presence of mild or moderate neutropenia. Aggressive management is not essential for patients with severe neutropenia in good physical condition after withdrawing anti-neurosyphilis regimen. We did not see an exacerbation of neutropenia in patients with the readministration of benzylpenicillin.
