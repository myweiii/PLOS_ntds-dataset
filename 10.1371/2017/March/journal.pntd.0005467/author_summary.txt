Schistosoma mansoni is one of four major species of human blood flukes that, together, infect over 250 million people worldwide. Transmission of S. mansoni to humans requires infection of freshwater intermediate host snails, Biomphalaria spp., in order to complete its life cycle. The B. glabrata embryonic (Bge) cell line, derived from a Puerto Rican strain of snail host shares characteristics with circulating hemocytes, the molluscan immune cells, and serves as an in vitro model for snail immune function. Electrical recordings from Bge cells demonstrated the presence of H+ channels that allow hydrogen ions (H+) to cross the membrane. Furthermore, blocking these channels inhibited the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an immune defense mechanism shared by Bge cells and hemocytes. Interestingly, Bge cell exposure to proteins produced by S. mansoni larvae exerted the opposite effect, enhancing H+ movement across the cell membrane. An H+ channel-encoding gene was expressed in both Bge cells and hemocytes suggesting that hemocytes may share similar functions with Bge cells.
