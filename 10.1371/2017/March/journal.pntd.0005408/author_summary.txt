Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi infection, is a mite-borne febrile illness endemic in the Asia-Pacific region. Recent emergence and continuous local outbreaks in many of the endemic countries make it a serious public health issue. In addition, the antigenic diversity of the tsa56 gene, encoding a major outer membrane protein, hampers the development of effective diagnostics and vaccine. Here, we extensively analyzed tsa56 sequences and their spatiotemporal information to elucidate the evolutionary pathway of genotypic diversification, as well as the environmental basis associated with the epidemiological changes of scrub typhus. Based on various informatics analyses, we found that genetic diversification of tsa56 might have been attained via frequent point mutations and subsequent genetic recombination among diverse genotypes. Prevalence of numerous bacterial genotypes and dominant vector species in Taiwan also suggest that the subtropical area located at the center of endemicity, may serve as a local mixing ground for genotype diversification. In addition, detection of identical and sub-identical clones of tsa56 genes in geographically distant countries indicates a potential spreading of bacterial genotypes. Continuous monitoring of dominant vector species and the associated O. tsutsugamushi genotypes might be required for developing better diagnostics and an effective vaccine for scrub typhus.
