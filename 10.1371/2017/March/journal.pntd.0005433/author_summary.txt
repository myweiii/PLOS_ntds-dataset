Chagas disease infection is a debilitating and neglected disease that occurs in 21 Latin America countries. The laboratory diagnosis is based on finding specific antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi pathogen. Several methods are available currently, but their performance depends on matrix used as antigen. In general, two methodologies are required to perform a correct diagnosis. We tested four chimeric proteins comprised by various antigens of T. cruzi by a method designated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proteins were high sensitivities and specifics, presenting accuracy higher than the commercial test Pathozyme Chagas. Additionally, the proteins IBMP-8.3 and -8.4 were more accurate than the Gold ELISA Chagas test. The proteins presented a very low cross-reactivity to unrelated diseases, including Leishmania spp. Reproducibility analyses showed that IBMP proteins are stable and the results are highly reproducible. Our findings indicate that the IBMP-8.4 protein can be safely used in serological tests for T. cruzi screening in blood banks and chronic CD laboratory.
