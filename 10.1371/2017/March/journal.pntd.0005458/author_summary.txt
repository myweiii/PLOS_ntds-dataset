Bothrops atrox is the dominant species responsible for accidental human snake bites in Northern Brazil. The efficacy of antivenom therapy to correct the systemic disturbances, including hemostatic disorders, caused by Brazilian Bothrops is well known. However, two fundamental issues need to be addressed in this region. (1) There are concerns regarding the effectiveness of the antivenom to treat Bothrops snake bites in this region since Bothrops atrox venom is not used as an antigen to obtain the Bothrops antivenom in Brazil, and (2) the efficacy of the antivenom therapy in reversing local injuries induced by Bothrops venoms is low. Thus, our study aimed to assess the effectiveness of antivenom therapy alone or in combination with dexamethasone to treat experimental envenomation induced by Bothrops atrox venom in mice. Our results showed that the Brazilian Bothrops antivenom effectively reversed the systemic disturbances caused by this envenomation and combining the antivenom therapy with dexamethasone accelerated the regression of inflammatory edema and the regeneration of skeletal muscle that was damaged by the venom.
