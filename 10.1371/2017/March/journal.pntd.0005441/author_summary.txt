Leptospirosis, also known as Weilâ€™s disease, is spread by contact with infected animals or with water and soil containing pathogenic spirochaetes belonging to the Leptospira genus. Leptospirosis is a serious public health problem that can cause kidney failure, pulmonary complications and can be fatal. Due to its similarity to other tropical fevers, leptospirosis is difficult to diagnose. It occurs mainly in developing countries with tropical climates and the WHO considers it one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases in the world. Existing vaccines, known as bacterins, are not recommended for general use and cause serious side-effects. Advances in the field of leptospirosis research have identified leptospiral proteins for use in a recombinant vaccine. However, evaluations using animal models reported mixed success and this has raised doubts as to their usefulness. The current study reports, for the first time, the evaluation of a subunit vaccine that reproducibly protected hamsters against leptospirosis and that induced sterile immunity among survivors. Significant antibody levels were induced in vaccinated animals and the antibody profile was characterised and found to be different to that induced by a bacterin vaccine. These observations suggest that we have identified a potential vaccine candidate for human an animal leptospirosis.
