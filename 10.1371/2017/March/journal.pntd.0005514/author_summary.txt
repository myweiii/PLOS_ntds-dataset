Soil-transmitted helminthes commonly known as worms, form part of the Neglected tropical diseases which are associated with substantial acute and chronic morbidity, particularly among children. Hookworm occurs throughout most of the country, with areas of highest prevalence being found in South-Western Kenya and the Coast Region. Regular administration of anthelmintic drugs has been strongly supported as an effective control strategy. Soil-transmitted helminthes can be controlled using three key approaches which include improved sanitation, mass treatment with albendazole and health education. Additional interventions for infection prevention include, access to safe water, environmental management and promotion of hygiene. However, the success of control initiatives involving the community depends on the level of the communities uptake of the programme, which is linked to the understanding of the community knowledge, practices and perceptions towards the disease. Therefore this study identified the gaps that should be addressed to contribute towards strengthening the parasitic infections control interventions in the area. The findings revealed high knowledge on worms and limited knowledge on signs and symptoms on the parasitic infections. These findings are valuable in designing approaches towards enhancing health outcomes in the community like implementing a community treatment and prevention programme to ensure effective control measures.
