Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness with considerable mortality, and no available vaccine, caused by the obligately intracellular bacterium, Orientia tsutsugamushi. Despite the life-threatening severity of the illness in approximately one million cases annually, 85â€“93% of patients survive. The lack of appropriate animal models of scrub typhus has left a void in the fundamental knowledge necessary to develop a vaccine, such as mechanisms which contribute to disease severity and immunity. Here, we report a sublethal inbred murine model for scrub typhus using the intradermal and intravenous routes of inoculation, which are comparable to the natural route of chigger-bite transmission and subsequent hematogenous spread. This model, infection of mice with O. tsutsugamushi Gilliam strain, can be employed in conjunction with the lethal model of O. tsutsugamushi Karp strain to perform in-depth mechanistic studies related to strain cross-protection, lethality, pathogenesis and specific immunological investigations of the host immune response.
