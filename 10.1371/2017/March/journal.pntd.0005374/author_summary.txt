Immunity to sand fly salivary proteins has been shown to confer protection against leishmaniasis in rodent models. Recombinant salivary protein SALO (Salivary Anticomplement of Lutzomyia longipalpis) was shown to protect hamsters against the fatal outcome of visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum and to protect against cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania braziliensis. Because of the potential use of this sand fly salivary protein as a component of a vaccine against human visceral leishmaniasis further characterization of SALO needs to be performed as well as a development plan for future scale manufacturing. In this work we present the successful expression and purification of recombinant SALO using Pichia pastoris. SALO from insect saliva inhibits the classical pathway of complement, an activity that may interfere with its role as a vaccine candidate. Here we show that recombinant SALO produced from Pichia pastoris, rSALO(P), does not have the anti-complement activity, and antibodies against rSALO(P) inhibit the anti-complement activity of sand fly saliva, suggesting that the overall structure of SALO is conserved regardless of expression source. The high-resolution structure of SALO was determined by single atom anomalous dispersion and refined to 1.94 Ã…. SALO is a small compact helical protein with no appreciable structural similarity to anti-complement or any reported mammalian protein structures. Therefore, SALO is a feasible candidate to be incorporated as a component of an effective anti-Leishmania vaccine.
