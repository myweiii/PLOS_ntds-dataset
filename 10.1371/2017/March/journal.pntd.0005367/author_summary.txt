Central Asia continues to be a hotspot for brucellosis among humans and livestock. The WHO classifies brucellosis as a neglected zoonosis that is rarely in the spotlight for research and mainly affects poor, marginalized people. One of the most powerful megatrends of our time is urbanization, and an often forgotten consequence of human urbanization is the urbanization of their livestock. When large concentrations of humans and livestock build up in urban areas, there is a concern that the transmission of zoonoses like brucellosis will increase. Our results indicate that Brucella DNA is widespread in dairy milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. This could constitute a public health risk because consumption of raw dairy products is common in the region. Furthermore, a discrepancy between the results of serology and PCR suggests that implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals might be warranted in Brucella control programmes.
