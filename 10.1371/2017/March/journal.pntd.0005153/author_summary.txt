Cysticercosis is a helminthic infection of the central nervous system (CNS) and the leading cause of late onset epilepsy in low-and middle-income countries. This neurological disease is a public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America, affecting impoverished rural and peri-urban populations where sanitation is inadequate. Diagnostic criteria for NCC vary according to regional availability and access to imaging and serological tests. This systematic review highlights the lack of appropriate methodology in most observational studies, with few studies including control groups, a basic epidemiological criteria needed to demonstrate an association. EITB for cysticercosis was widely used to measure exposure, and brain CT scan was a non-invasive alternative used to identify cysts. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a preventable neurological condition in the tropics despite resource limitations in LMIC regions. Well-designed studies are needed to provide quality evidence to support control interventions and surveillance systems for this important zoonotic disease.
