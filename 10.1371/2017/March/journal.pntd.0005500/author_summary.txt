Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a neglected systemic mycosis caused by fungi of the genus Paracoccidioides present in the soil and is endemic to Latin America. The acute clinical form of this disease is less frequent than the chronic type of presentation. However, it is a more severe clinical condition, potentially life-threatening, affecting many important organs of the immune defense such as the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. It can lead to serious complications as well as many sequelae in young vulnerable patients and children. There are few works published in the literature concerning clinical, epidemiological, prognostic and therapeutic features of acute juvenile PCM. This study aims to describe a 9-year cohort study of patients with acute juvenile PCM from a reference center in the endemic area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Results demonstrate that early diagnosis can prevent poor outcomes and that a specialized medical structure is required to promote proper healthcare for these patients. Severe outcomes such as low adrenal reserve and a death occurred in 4 and 1 patients, respectively. The authors expect that these results can contribute to a better understanding of this severe fungal disease.
