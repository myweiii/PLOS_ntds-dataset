Leprosy reactions (Type 1 and 2) are important causes of nerve damage and illness. Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) also called type 2 reaction is a severe systemic immune-mediated complication of borderline and lepromatous leprosy. ENL causes high morbidity and thus requires immediate medical attention. We recruited 77 untreated patients with lepromatous leprosy (46 patients with ENL reactions and 31 patients without ENL reactions) in Ethiopia to better define the immune regulation process in patients with ENL reactions. We took blood samples at 3 time points (before, during and after prednisolone treatment) and measured regulatory T-cells at each time point. Patients with ENL reactions had a lower percentage of CD4+ regulatory T-cells than in non-reactional LL patient controls before treatment. Patients with ENL reactions had higher percentage of CD4+ T- cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio than LL patient controls before treatment. These experiments indicate the need to explore ways of restoring regulatory T-cells in patients with ENL reactions to control the undesired outcome of the reaction.
