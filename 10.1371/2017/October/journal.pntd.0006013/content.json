    "Introduction": "CCHFV is an RNA virus classified in the Orthonairovirus genus, of the family Nairoviridae, within the order Bunyavirales (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2016). It displays a high degree of sequence variability [1] with the S-segments of CCHF viruses being phylogenetically grouped into 7 clades (Europe 1, Europe 2, Africa 1, Africa 2, Africa 3, Asia 1 and Asia 2) [2][3][4].\nCCHF is easily transmitted by close contact and causes a virulent haemorrhagic fever in humans for which there is no effective prophylaxis or treatment: in consequence it is classified by the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) as a Hazard Group 4 pathogen mandating maximum microbiological containment (containment level 4; CL4). CCHFV has been detected in large parts of the globe including Southern and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Western China, the Middle East and most of Africa [1] [5] [6]. CCHF has been described as \u201cone of the most rapidly emerging viral haemorrhagic fevers in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe,\u201d by the WHO, with case numbers increasing in many countries in recent years [7] [8] [9]. The case fatality for CCHF is typically between 5\u201350%, but has been documented as high as 73% [1] [10] [11]. Ticks of the genus Hyalomma function as vector as well as natural reservoir of CCHFV [12]. The Hyalomma tick feeds on various vertebrate hosts and as a consequence CCHFV is carried by wild animals and livestock [13] [14] and can be transmitted to humans both by tick bite and by contact with infected bodily fluids [1].\nWith outbreaks occurring in rural areas; commonly in low-resource regions with limited access to conventional laboratory facilities, there is an urgent need for a simple, fast, reliable and portable diagnostic test [8]. This would enable rapid diagnosis and public health management of suspect human cases, as well as surveillance of the virus in vertebrate and tick populations in isolated locations. CCHFV infection has a propensity for nosocomial transmission, especially during the early stages of disease when symptoms are poorly recognised and laboratory diagnosis is not commonly requested or performed. In these circumstances it can lead to outbreaks of highly pathogenic disease sustained by human-to-human transmission [8] [10] [12]. Rapid detection of positive cases could lead to more timely and appropriate support for patients, including their isolation to prevent transmission and the protection of health care providers by initiation of barrier nursing techniques. More convenient tools for CCHFV surveillance in the environment would also facilitate our understanding of the natural fluxes of virus in populations and help develop effective countermeasures and timely interventions [8].\nThere has been a recent proliferation of research into next-generation molecular diagnostics with improvements in performance relative to traditional PCR [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]. Many of these adopt a single (isothermal) incubation temperature and a variety of non-thermal methods to separate duplex DNA, allowing amplification of a target region without the need for thermal cycling. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a well-established isothermal molecular technique and compares favourably with other isothermal methods such as LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification), with a rapid turnaround time and simple set-up. It is performed at a single low temperature (37\u201342 degrees), using a recombinase enzyme to separate the DNA duplex and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins to stabilise the open complex [16], allowing amplification and detection with standard probe chemistries. As there is no thermal cycling, there is no time-constraint on the amplification as there is with PCR and amplification occurs continually. This makes the RPA method significantly faster, with amplification occurring within 3\u20135 minutes for high copy number samples [15] [16] [27].\nThe low RPA incubation temperature and high speed makes assay systems based on the RPA technology particularly amenable to field-use due to the low power requirements. This allows detection on simple portable devices, which can be small and lightweight [15] [16], including both miniaturised isothermal real-time detectors and fully automated rapid point-of care devices [15] [16]. RPA and other isothermal methods have shown high tolerance to inhibitors present in crude preparations of patient samples and arthropod vectors [28] [29] [30]. The elimination of laboratory intensive extraction procedures simplifies and speeds up the assay set-up and streamlines the automated point-of-care device, potentially making it lighter and cheaper to both purchase and run.\nThe aim of this work was to develop an RPA assay as an alternative to the existing RT-PCR methods [31] and provide a fast and fieldable diagnostic, which could be used to test for CCHFV with minimal sample preparation, allowing surveillance and public health management decisions in isolated regions. The RPA shows a high degree of flexibility, so it could also be used in a clinic setting or a traditional laboratory, providing very rapid turnaround of results (<20 minutes), with the potential for high-throughput in a 96-well plate format. The aims of the study were successfully achieved, with the development of a rapid RPA-based isothermal diagnostic capable of detecting all 7 S-segment phylogenetic clades of CCHF within 10 minutes.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nSera samples tested in this study were previously taken for the laboratory diagnosis of CCHFV and were classified as clinical specimens. No samples were collected specifically for this work, thus ethical approval for the study design was not required. Samples were anonymised within Tajikistan, so investigators were only supplied with sequentially numbered samples. Sera samples were collected and stored within the Tajik Research Institute of Preventive Medicine, Tajikistan. Samples for testing at Public Health England, UK were sent in accordance with national guidelines for both Tajikistan and the UK.\n\n\nPrimer and probe design\nThe CCHF RPA assay was designed using alignments of the S-segments of CCHF strains and examination for regions of genomic stability, together with an NCBI BLAST search to check for CCHF specificity. The aim was to find a region which would allow uniform detection of all of the 7 clades of CCHF, but would not detect any non-CCHF sequences. A series of primers and probes were designed within this region and a small selection of synthetic RNA fragments (approximately 1.7kb) were designed to enable primer-probe testing. The primer and probe sets were sequentially tested for detection of the synthetic templates. The lead primer and probe combination was taken forward for further validation.\n\n\nPrimer and probe preparation\nPrimers were prepared by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and an RPA EXO probe was synthesised by ATD BIO; all as HPLC purified material. Primer and probe stocks were prepared at 100\u03bcM in a Tris-EDTA buffer and diluted to 10\u03bcM in molecular grade dH20. A primer mix was prepared to 5\u03bcM (of both forward and reverse primers) and both primer mix and probe stocks were frozen at -20\u00b0C in single use aliquots.\n\n\nSynthetic CCHF S-segment RNA template preparation\nSynthetic CCHF S-segment DNA fragments from a selection of Europe group 1 and 2 strains and Africa 1 and 3 strains were prepared by IDT (AY277672, position 1\u20131673, DQ211638, position 1\u20131659, DQ211643, position 1\u20131671, NC005302, position 1\u20131672 and U88411, position 1\u20131686) with the addition of T7 and SP6 promoters at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends respectively (see S1 Fig). RNA templates were prepared from the synthetic DNA using a T7 High Yield RNA synthesis kit (NEB). Approximately 1\u03bcg of DNA was added per reaction to a 0.2ml PCR tube with 2\u03bcl each of 100mM ATP, GTP, UTP and CTP, 2\u03bcl RNA polymerase mix, 2\u03bcl 10X reaction buffer and sufficient molecular grade dH20 to make the reaction up to 20\u03bcl. The reaction was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for two hours in a thermocycler. The RNA template was then DNase-treated to remove the original template contamination; 70\u03bcl nuclease free dH2O was added per tube with 10\u03bcl 10X DNase I buffer and 2\u03bcl RNase-free DNase I (NEB). The tubes were mixed and incubated for 15 mins at 37\u00b0C. The RNA was purified using a Qiagen RNeasy minikit and quantified using a Qubit broad range RNA kit (Thermo-Fisher Scientific).\n\n\nCrude sample preparation\nCrude samples included human serum male AB (Sigma H422-20ML), female Ixodes ricinus ticks (Charles River) and Surine standard -ve control urine (Sigma S-020-50ML). Sample preparation included aliquoting of the human male serum and urine standard into single use aliquots and storage at -20\u00b0C and fridge temperature respectively. The tick samples were prepared as tick pools (10 ticks) and frozen at -20 \u00b0C. The ticks were prepared by adding 300\u03bcl molecular grade water, transferring to Precellys-R tubes and homogenising using a Precellys tissue homogeniser (3X 20 seconds, with 30 second breaks). The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 5900xg and the supernatant retained. A serial dilution of each of the neat samples was prepared by diluting in molecular grade water.\n\n\nCCHF RPA on the Applied Biosystems 7500 platform\nThe CCHF RPA assay was performed in a 50\u03bcl volume using a TwistAmp Exo-RT kit (TwistDx Cambridge UK). A master mix was prepared, composed of the following/reaction; 4.2\u03bcl of a 5\u03bcM primer mix (forward and reverse primer), 0.6\u03bcl of the 10\u03bcM Exo-probe, 29.5\u03bcl rehydration buffer and sufficient distilled water to make the reaction up to 50\u03bcl after addition of all assay components. Where crude samples were used, 20 units (0.5\u03bcl) of an RNase inhibitor was also included (RNaseOUT 40U/\u03bcl Invitrogen). The master mix was distributed into the wells of a 96-well PCR plate. 1\u20135\u03bcl of template (together with 5\u03bcl crude sample if used) was added and the reaction mixture combined with the lyophilised enzyme pellet, before returning to the plate. The supplied magnesium acetate was diluted to 140mM with molecular grade dH20, 5\u03bcl was added to each well and the plate briefly centrifuged before running at 40 \u00b0C for 40 minutes on an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system, with fluorescence detection every 60 seconds in the FAM channel. The threshold was set at 50,000 delta Rn.\n\n\nCCHF RPA with an RT-RPA basic kit\nThe RT-RPA basic assay was performed in a 50\u03bcl volume using a TwistAmp Basic-RT kit (TwistDx Cambridge UK). A master mix was prepared, composed of the following/reaction; 4.2\u03bcl of 5\u03bcM primer mix (forward and reverse primer), 29.5\u03bcl rehydration buffer and sufficient distilled water to make the reaction up to 50\u03bcl after addition of all assay components. The master mix was distributed into 0.2ml PCR tube strips. 5\u03bcl of template was added and the reaction mixture combined with the lyophilised enzyme pellet, before returning to the wells. The supplied magnesium acetate was diluted to 140mM with molecular grade dH20 and 5\u03bcl was added to each well. The tube strip was then briefly centrifuged before incubating at 40 \u00b0C for 40 minutes on a thermocycler. The products of the RPA were purified using a Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit, then run on an Invitrogen 2% Agarose gel (E-Gel EX with Sybr Gold II) with an Invitrogen E gel 1Kb plus ladder.\n\n\nCCHF RT-PCR on the Applied Biosystems 7500 platform\nThis method was adapted from the paper by Atkinson et al 2012 [31]. Briefly, the CCHF RT-PCR assay was performed in a 20\u03bcl volume using a Superscript III Platinum One-step quantitative RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). For each reaction, a 15\u03bcl master mix was prepared containing 10\u03bcl of the supplied 2X reaction mix, 0.8\u03bcl of superscript III RT/Taq enzyme mix and final concentrations of each primer of 1.2\u03bcM and probe of 0.8\u03bcM. Where crude samples were used, 20 units (0.5\u03bcl) of an RNase inhibitor was also included (RNaseOUT 40U/\u03bcl Invitrogen) and sufficient molecular grade water was added for a final reaction volume of 20\u03bcl, once all assay components were included. The master mix was distributed into the wells of a 96-well PCR plate. 3\u20135\u03bcl of template (together with 5\u03bcl crude sample if used) was added and the plate briefly centrifuged before being run on an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system. The PCR run parameters included a 10 minute RT step at 50 \u00b0C, followed by a 2 minute denaturation step at 95\u00b0C, an amplification stage composed of 45 cycles of denaturation: 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds, and annealing/extension at 60\u00b0C for 40 seconds, followed by a final extension at 40 \u00b0C for 20 seconds. Fluorescence was detected in the FAM channel, once each cycle during the amplification stage. The threshold was set at 250,000 delta Rn.\n\n\nCCHF positive viral panel\nA collection of CCHFV strains representing each of the following S-segment clades: Asia 1, Asia 2, Africa 2, Africa 3 and Europe 1 were cultured and viral RNA was extracted using a standard RNA extraction kit (QIAamp viral RNA kit). Synthetic whole S-segment viral RNA was used to represent Africa 1 and Europe 2 clades.\n\n\nNegative viral panel\nViral RNA extracts covering Mammarenavirus, Marburgvirus, Henipavirus, Flavivirus, Alphavirus and the Orthohantavirus genera were donated by the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory, PHE Porton from a collection of standard diagnostic assay positive controls. They are described as positive, with a Ct of approximately 30 in their respective real-time assays, or as having a clear and distinct band after electrophoresis of PCR products following a conventional block-based PCR. The Orthonairovirus samples Hazara and Issyk-Kul were supplied in-house by the National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses and the Virology and Pathogenesis group respectively and were confirmed positive using a block-based PCR.\n\n\nPreparation of RNA extracts from field samples for testing on the RPA\nTicks identified as Hyalomma anatolicum were collected from the Gisar, Hissor, Kulob, Rumi, Jillikul and Hamadoni districts of Tajikistan and prepared as pools of 10 ticks by the Tajik Research Institute of Preventive Medicine, Dushanbe, Tajikistan. The ticks were added to 1ml Qiagen AVL buffer and were homogenised using a disposable plastic pestle and mortar, allowing 10 minutes post-homogenisation for inactivation. Sera samples were collected from suspected CCHF patients from the Rudaki, Nahiyeh Voseh, Bokhtar, Kologh, Nahiyey farkhor, Moominabad, Khatlon, Bolgevon, Tursonzadeh, Kabadian, Dangarah, Vosse and Kulob districts of Tajikistan by the Tajik Research Institute of Preventive Medicine, Dushanbe, Tajikistan. The sera samples were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C and both the inactivated tick pool samples and sera were frozen at -80 for storage. The tick homogenate was centrifuged at 4000xg for 10 minutes to pellet the particulate matter. A 140\u03bcl volume of the neat sera samples and tick pool supernatant were extracted using a Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA mini kit, with elution into 80\u03bcl elution buffer. Note that most sera samples represent a single sera collection, taken on a single day from separate patients. Where samples are multiple sample collections, taken on separate days from a single patient, the sample number is followed by a letter (e.g. sample 4a, 4b, 4c) and a collection number is given.\n\n\nAccession Numbers\nGenbank accession numbers/ NCBI reference sequences for genes used in this study: Bagdad 12 (Genbank accession number AJ538196), Dubai 616 (Genbank accession number JN108025), DAK 8194 (Genbank accession number U88411), Semunya (Genbank accession number DQ076413), Congo 3010 (Genbank accession number DQ144418), SPU4/81(Genbank accession number DQ076416), IbAr10200 (NCBI reference sequence NC_005302), Kosovo Hoti (Genbank accession number DQ133507), ROS/T128044 (Genbank accession number AY277672), Drosdov (Genbank accession number DQ211643), AP92 (Genbank accession number DQ211638).",
    "Results": "Assay design\nThe CCHFV RPA assay was developed by making alignments of CCHF S-segment sequences and analysing them for stable regions to identify sequences that could be used as the basis for primer and probe design. The lead primer-probe set (see Fig 1A) is shown aligned to a selection of CCHFV strains representing the 7 S-segment clades of the virus (Africa 1, Africa 2, Africa 3, Asia 1, Asia 2, Europe 1 and Europe 2 (Fig 1B). The regions chosen for the RPA primer design were in the vicinity of the primer binding sites of our in-house CCHF PCR, which has shown good cross-clade detection [31]. Some single base mismatches within the primer and probe regions remained, but this was unavoidable due to the high intrinsic sequence variability of the CCHFV S-segment. We were confident that our RPA assay would show good amplification across the clades however, as there was significant overlap in the design region with the PCR and the RPA primers were generally well matched and long, thereby increasing resilience to minimal base-mismatches. The target region was also subjected to a BLAST (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) search to check for cross-reactivity with non-CCHFV sequences; no non-CCHFV sequences were identified, suggesting that the assay would be CCHFV-specific.\n(a) Primer, probe and synthetic template DNA sequences. Table showing primer and probe sequences and information on the synthetic DNA templates which were used as transcription templates to create the RNA assay controls. Please see supplementary data for the full DNA sequences of the synthetic DNA templates. (b) Alignment of CCHF strains at the assay design region. Alignment of a selection of strains of CCHFV representing all 7 S-segment clades of CCHFV (Africa 1, Africa 2, Africa 3, Asia 1, Asia 2, Europe 1 and Europe 2), with inclusion of the RPA forward primer (CCHF RPA Fw), the reverse primer (CCHF RPA Rev) and the probe (CCHF RPA probe 1).\n\n\nDetection limit\nThe detection limit of the CCHFV RPA assay was determined by testing with a serial dilution of a synthetic RNA S-Segment of the Europe 1 strain AY277672 from 5X106 template copies down to 50 copies (Fig 2). Rapid detection was observed, occurring within 5 minutes for the detection of 50X106 template copies, just over 10 minutes for the detection of 5X103 copies and 16 minutes for the detection of 500 copies. The detection limit was between 500 and 50 copies, with strong and rapid detection down to 500 copies, but with variable and sub-threshold detection at 50 copies. The probit analysis gave a predictive value for the limit of detection of this assay as 251 copies of target. The data showed a good correlation between copy number and time to positive, suggesting that this method is either quantitative or semi-quantitative.\nLimit of detection of the CCHF RPA assay with a serial (1 in 10) dilution of synthetic RNA template of Europe I strain AY277672. The data is represented graphically as (a) Delta Rn against time (minutes), in the form of a table of time to positive (TTP value) vs target copy number and as TTP vs target copy number, with a regression line indicating data correlation (b). The data is also shown as a probit analysis performed using the statistical software Matlab for more accurate detection limit approximation (c), with application of a curve-fitting programme (a shape-preserving piecewise cubic interpolation). Note that the probit analysis uses a lower threshold (Delta Rn 18000) to enable the calculation. The values shown for all LOD data are the mean of 8 independent experiments, each of which was performed with three replicates.\n\n\nCross-clade detection of CCHFV\nThe CCHFV RPA was subsequently tested against a selection of strains representing all 7 extant clades of the viral S-segment. This included where possible cultured viral extract, and a selection of 5X105 copies/reaction synthetic whole S-segment RNA templates (See S1 Fig. for synthetic target sequence information). The target was successfully identified (Fig 3), across all 7 clades, with the same rapid detection noted earlier. The RPA time to positive (TTP) was less than 12 minutes for all viral extracts, with most detected between 5\u201310 minutes. Data from a CCHFV S-segment RT-PCR [31] is shown alongside, with the TTP values ranging from 39.6 to 54.6 minutes. The CCHFV RPA was also performed with a basic RT-RPA kit (no exo-probe) and synthetic CCHFV RNA templates. When analysed by gel electrophoresis with a DNA intercalating dye, the results showed a single band of the expected size of around 150bp, suggesting that only the target region is amplified (see S2 Fig).\nTable showing detection of CCHF viral extracts and synthetic CCHF RNA templates by CCHF RPA assay, in the form of TTP (minutes) and number of replicates detected. The synthetic RNA templates were used at 5X105 copies/reaction and viral extracts were confirmed positive by CCHF RT-PCR. The RT-PCR TTP (minutes) are included in the table. Note that the RPA values shown are the mean of 3 independent experiments, performed with 2\u20133 replicates.\n\n\nNegative panel testing\nThe specificity of the CCHFV RPA was tested against a panel of viral extracts, encompassing both phylogenetically related strains and species which cause a similar haemorrhagic aetiology in humans and may be tested as part of a differential diagnosis. These included viruses from the Mammarenavirus, Marburgvirus, Henipavirus, Orthonairovirus and Orthohantavirus genera (Fig 4). All produced negative results, backing up the hypothesised specificity which had been suggested from the bioinformatic information. Of particular note is the fact that the closely-related Orthonairoviruses Hazara and Issyk-Kul were negative.\nTable showing the results of a CCHF RPA with a negative viral panel, consisting of a selection of strains from the Alphavirus, Mammarenavirus, Marburgvirus, Flavivirus, Orthohantavirus, Henipavirus and Orthonairovirus genera. Results represent 3 separate experiments, each performed with 3 replicates.\n\n\nEffect of inhibitors in crude sample preparations\nIsothermal molecular amplification methods such as RPA and LAMP are tolerant to crude samples, allowing detection in patient bodily fluids, arthropod preparations and other crude material with minimal processing and avoiding the need for extraction [28] [29] [32] [33] [34]. The inhibitory effect of interfering agents within a crude sample on the CCHFV RPA was studied by spiking a known quantity of synthetic CCHFV template into crude preparations of human serum, a homogenised tick pool and synthetic human urine. Fig 5A shows strong detection in the presence of each crude sample. There is however evidence of some inhibition at the higher crude sample dilutions, with higher TTP values, although the urine sample showed no observable inhibition at any concentration. Serum showed full detection of the 5X106 copies/reaction template at the 1-in-10 dilution and the tick preparation at the 1-in-100 dilution. This suggests the CCHFV RPA can tolerate the inhibitors present in crude samples with minimal sample preparation, when the copy number of target is high.\n(a) Effect of crude sample dilution on detection in the RPA assay. RPA performed with 5X106 copies/ reaction of synthetic RNA template of Europe I strain AY277672 and a serial (1 in 10) dilution of crude preparations of human male serum, urine and tick pool homogenate. (b) Effect of crude material on assay sensitivity\u2013limit of detection. RPA performed with a serial (1 in 10) dilution of synthetic RNA template of Europe I strain AY277672 and 1 in 10 diluted crude preparations of serum and urine, or 1 in 100 diluted crude preparations of tick pool homogenate. The RPA results are shown as TTP (minutes) and represent the mean of 3\u20134 independent experiments, each of which was performed with three replicates. RT-PCR data is also included for comparison, with the values shown representing the mean TTP (mins) of 2\u20133 separate experiments, each of which was performed with 2 replicates.\nWe next examined the limit of detection in minimally diluted crude samples. Fig 5B indicates that the urine and tick preparation had no effect on the assay limit of detection, with both showing full detection down to 500 copies and partial detection at 50 copies, with comparable TTP values to data using un-spiked purified RNA. Serum showed a minimal effect on the detection limit, with partial detection at 50 and 500 copies and higher TTP values, but with comparable TTP and 100% detection at 5000 copies. Overall however this work suggests that the inhibitory effect of diluted crude samples on the CCHFV RPA is minimal. All crude sample preparations except for the urine showed some inhibitory effect on the detection limit of the CCHFV RT-PCR, with approximately a 10-fold change for the tick and serum preparations.\n\n\nTesting of 2013\u20132015 CCHF outbreak samples\nCCHFV has caused seasonal outbreaks [35] of disease in Tajikistan since its discovery in the region over 40 years ago. The assay including a portable incubator and reader (Optigene Genie III) was taken to a collaborating laboratory in Dushanbe; the Tajik Institute for Preventive Medicine. This Ministry of Health institute undertakes diagnostic testing for a range of serious pathogens and is the National Centre for CCHF diagnosis; it has regular access to CCHF clinical samples and supports national disease reporting programmes. The CCHFV RPA was set up and used on a collection of extracted patient sera samples and environmental tick extracts obtained in relation to outbreaks of CCHF in 2013\u20132015 in Tajikistan, these field samples were tested alongside a standard RT-PCR assay [31] that had already been established. The field samples were then sent back to our UK-based laboratory for further testing. The CCHFV RPA (Fig 6) detected nearly all confirmed positives (88% of 8 positive tick samples and 100% of 13 positive sera samples), missing only one very late TTP weakly positive tick extract. The RPA also verified the negatives (100% of 8 negative tick samples and 91% of 11 independent (from separate patients) negative sera samples), with one exception (sample 16). It is possible this could be a false positive, however this was a sample which had previously been tested by ELISA and found to be IgM positive for CCHF, so it is likely that this is actually a positive sample. The majority of positive samples were detected in less than 20 minutes (4 samples were detected between 21 and 31 minutes).\nCCHF RPA testing of a collection of field samples from the 2013\u20132015 CCHF outbreaks in Tajikistan. Sample types include extracted human sera and extracted tick pool homogenate. The RPA results are shown as TTP (minutes) and number of replicates detected. RT-PCR results are shown as TTP (minutes).",
    "Discussion": "A CCHFV RPA has been successfully developed and shown to rapidly detect all 7 CCHFV S-segment types, despite the presence of a small number of single mismatches within the primer and probe binding sites.\nData from a negative panel of closely related viruses including those that might be included as part of a differential diagnosis, illustrate the high specificity for CCHFV. The sensitivity of this assay was statistically estimated to be 251copies of RNA target, which compares well with other published RPA assays [20] [21] [23] [24]. While this sensitivity is lower than the published RT-PCR for CCHFV of 5\u201350 copies [31], it is still within the clinical detection range present in most acute CCHF patients, as demonstrated by its ability to pick-up all of the confirmed sera positives in the panel of samples from an outbreak in Tajikistan. The assay is also very rapid, providing clear results within 20 minutes (5 minutes for the detection of 50X106 template copies, 10 minutes for the detection of 5X103 copies and 16 minutes for the detection of 500 copies) and an average of 13.8 mins (range 6.8\u201330.7 mins) for the real clinical/field samples. The CCHFV RPA performed well with spiked crude samples with only a small level of dilution required to remove inhibitory effects. In addition the CCHF RPA strongly detected a clinical sample which had been missed by the PCR, suggesting that the RPA may be able to detect a wider cross-section of CCHF strains than the existing PCR. This is supported by our cross-template detection study, in which the RPA detected a strain Drosdov, which the PCR failed to pick up.\nThe CCHF RPA has demonstrated its potential for use both as a field/low resource laboratory diagnostic and traditional laboratory test. It is significantly faster than existing RT-PCR-based methods (maximum run time of 35 minutes, compared to 1 hour 10 minutes of the RT-PCR) enabling faster-turnaround and key information to physicians and health care workers, underlining its suitability as a point-of-need diagnostic in the community clinic, or the field. The fast turnaround would also be of benefit in a standard laboratory set-up enabling high-throughput testing. The potential of this diagnostic in low resource settings is highlighted by its validation in Tajikistan using a simple portable isothermal real-time detector. This mirrors published literature generated with the Genie III device [36] and underlines the benefits of an isothermal diagnostic over the traditional RT-PCR in low resource settings.\nThe applicability of the RPA and other isothermal molecular assays to crude unprocessed clinical samples is often highlighted [28] [29] [30] as a useful advantage. While we show that the current assay is amenable to such samples, further studies will be needed to fully evaluate the potential for use of this assay with crude clinical material, including careful consideration of the biosafety implications when handling this HG4 virus. This will involve testing the RPA with live virus preparations spiked into crude sample material in addition to un-extracted virus in real clinical samples, to confirm whether native virus can be detected. The primary consideration when working with infectious viral material will be to examine methods for disrupting the viral envelope to allow access to the viral nucleic acid and to inactivate the virus to render it safe to handle, whilst avoiding adding to the complexity of the process."
