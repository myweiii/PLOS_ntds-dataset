Infection with lymphatic filarial parasites usually occurs early in childhood in endemic areas, but clinical signs appear much later. Reversal of lymphatic pathology has been shown with the much less common Brugia malayi infection using DEC and albendazole and there is scarce evidence whether the same occurs with bancroftian filariasis using the above drugs. We designed this study to look for prevalence of lymphatic pathology in children with and without clinical signs of infection and to observe the effect on the pre-treatment pathology using DEC and albendazole given once or twice a year. We have shown, using lymphoscintigraphy, that lymphatic vessel changes occur very early in infection, and treatment can reverse these changes, even when clinical symptoms are already apparent. This has important implications for lymphedema prevention, case management and for advocacy in the Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program. It also strengthens the previous evidence of benefit of treatment on early lymphedema management.
