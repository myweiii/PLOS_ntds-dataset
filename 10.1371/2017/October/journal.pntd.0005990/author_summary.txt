The Spondweni serogroup of viruses, which includes Zika virus and Spondweni virus, are mosquito-borne viruses that can cause disease in humans. During the recent outbreak of Zika virus in the Americas, sexual transmission and in utero transmission have also been described. Due to the close genetic identity of Zika and Spondweni viruses, the herein reported study used a mouse model to assess the sexual transmission capacity of Spondweni virus in comparison to recent outbreak Zika strains and older Zika virus strains. In this model, all Zika strains were shed in seminal fluids from infected males. However, the percentage of ejaculates that contained infectious virus was significantly lower for Spondweni-infected males than Zika-infected males. Thus, sexual transmission potential is conserved among Zika viruses and not likely to fully explain the magnitude and dynamics of the recent outbreak in the Americas. In addition, sexual transmission potential should be further evaluated for Spondweni virus. Virus-specific differences in rates of shedding in seminal fluids will inform future studies on the viral determinants of sexual transmission.
