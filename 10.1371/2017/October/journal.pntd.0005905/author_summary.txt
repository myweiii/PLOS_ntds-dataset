During murine experimental leishmaniasis sand fly saliva components modulate the host immune response and facilitate infection while pre-exposition to uninfected sand fly bites is associated with a protective cellular response against subsequent infection. Human anti-saliva immune responses are not well defined in leishmaniasis endemic areas. Here, we report an analysis of anti P. papatasi saliva cellular and humoral responses in individuals residing in endemic foci showing different prevalence rates of L. major infection. Individuals were further subdivided based on LST response and presence of typical CL scars. We showed higher anti-saliva cellular and humoral responses and a skew towards a Th2 response in the old focus characterized by the highest prevalence of infection. No correlation was observed between LST and anti-saliva cellular or humoral response. We showed that high anti-saliva IgG responses constituted a risk factor for the development of CL. Our findings suggest that the anti-P. papatasi saliva cellular and humoral response profiles vary with the level of sand fly exposure and the prevalence of infection in CL endemic areas. Such studies in humans from highly endemic areas could contribute to a better understanding of the immune response to sand fly saliva and its role in leishmaniasis outcome.
