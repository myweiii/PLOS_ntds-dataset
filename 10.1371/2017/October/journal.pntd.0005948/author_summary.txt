It is thought that inadequate sanitation may exacerbate hookworm transmission, and that hookworm infection may give rise to health problems including anemia, stunting, and wasting. Integrating monitoring of, and interventions against, these problems may yield significant cost savings. Such integrated interventions should be guided by both evidence of the relationships between the various health problems, and examples of optimally effective integration. Here, we present baseline findings from a three-year longitudinal study investigating combined school feeding; school water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and deworming interventions in 30 primary schools in southern Ethiopia. In particular, we compare household sanitation, hookworm infection, and anemia, stunting, and wasting, in the schoolchildren. None of these associations were found to be statistically significant (although hookworm infection was associated with borderline statistically significantly higher odds of anemia; P = 0.06). The lack of significant associations may be due to the low intensities of the hookworm infections in this setting, poor conditions of latrines reducing their impact on hookworm transmission, and other factors such as malaria and inadequate diet causing anemia, stunting, and wasting.
