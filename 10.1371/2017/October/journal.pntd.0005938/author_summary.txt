Lymphatic filariasis is a chronic human disease caused by parasitic worms and transmitted by mosquitoes. The disease is targeted for elimination by 2020 through the treatment of the entire population at risk in endemic areas using a mass drug administration (MDA) strategy. After several years of MDA, there is now growing interest in including vector control as a supplement to MDA to achieve elimination goal. This study was carried out to determine mosquito abundance and transmission of lymphatic filariasis on Mafia Islands in Tanzania after nine rounds of MDA. Mosquitoes were collected indoor and outdoor using Centre for Disease Control (CDC) light and gravid traps, respectively. Filarial mosquito vectors were examined for infection with Wuchereria bancrofti by microscopy and PCR technique. A total of 35,534 filarial mosquito vectors were collected, of which Anopheles gambiae complex, An. funestus group and Culex quinquefasciatus Say accounted for 1.3, 0.5 and 98.2%, respectively. Using PCR, An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s) and An. funestus s.s sibling species accounted for 88.3% and 99.1% of the identified members of the An. gambiae complex and An. funestus group, respectively. A total of 7,936 mosquitoes were examined for infection with W. bancrofti by microscopy. The infection and infectivity rates were 0.25% and 0.08%, respectively. Using PCR technique, of 324 mosquito pools (each with 25 mosquitoes) tested, 115 were found to be infected with at least a larval stage of W. bancrofti. The study concludes that Cx. quinquefasciatus is the dominant mosquito on Mafia Islands and that W. bancrofti transmission is still ongoing on Mafia Islands after a decade of control activities based on MDA.
