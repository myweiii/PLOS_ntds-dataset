This is the first study that evaluates the effect of BMMSCs therapy for lung fibrosis induced by the fungal pathogen Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, one of the most important systemic endemic mycosis diagnosed in South America and Central America. Our findings showed an impaired anti-fibrotic effect of BMMSCs transplantation. This effect could be triggered by either the chronic inflammatory microenvironment induced by P. brasiliensis or by a direct interaction between BMMSCs and the fungus, resulting in an exacerbation of the pulmonary fibrosis. In fact, the pro-fibrotic effect exerted by BMMSCs was toned-down by the usage of the antifungal ITC.
