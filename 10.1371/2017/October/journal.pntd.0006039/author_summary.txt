Despite a worldwide prevalence, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) remains largely neglected, with no prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine available. In the Old World, CL is mainly caused by either Leishmania major or L. tropica parasites, which produce localized cutaneous ulcers, often leading to scarring and social stigma. Currently, the disease has reached hyperendemicity levels in the Middle East due to conflict and human displacement. Furthermore, the first choice of treatment in that region continues to be pentavalent antimonials, which are costly and highly toxic, and current vector control measures alone are not sufficient to stop disease transmission. Hence, a vaccine against CL would be very beneficial. Previous studies have demonstrated that sugars are promising vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis, since most parasite species have a cell surface coat composed of immunogenic sugars, including linear α-galactopyranosyl (α-Gal) epitopes, which are absent in humans. Here, we have developed an α-Gal-based vaccine candidate, named NGP5B. When tested in transgenic mice which like humans lack α-Gal epitopes in their cells, NGP5B was able to induce a significant partial protection against L. major infection, by significantly reducing mouse footpad lesions and parasite burden. Altogether, we propose NGP5B as a promising preventive vaccine for CL caused by L. major.
