We would like to thank the Community Health Workers of the Dabaso Tujengane CBO for their assistance in identifying cases and treating the patients. We are particularly in debt to Billy Mwangemi, Kakuyuni Community Health Officer, for his excellent support, Shedrack Mwadai and Wilson Yaa for conducting the interviews. We thank the Kilifi County Departments of Health and Education for their support of the study.
