Clonorchiasis, a parasitic infection by Clonorchis sinensis, is one of the major public health problems in eastern Asian countries, including China, Korea, and Vietnam, causing cholangiocarcinoma if not treated. The definitive diagnosis is important for successful treatment and prevention of the infection in endemic areas. The fecal examination is a standard diagnostic method and mainly based on microscopic observation of eggs in feces. However, they sometimes miss lightly infected cases and can lead to misidentification at the species level because of morphological similarity between the eggs of liver flukes and minute intestinal flukes. To overcome the diagnostic limitations of stool examination, ELISAs and PCRs have been developed as a sensitive and specific diagnostic method, but they require sophisticated equipment such as thermal cycler and spectrophotometry, which has prevented the widespread use of these techniques in low resource areas. We developed a LAMP assay targeting the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene of C. sinensis for rapid and simple detection of C. sinensis DNA in human fecal samples. The LAMP assay was highly specific and sensitive enough to detect as little as 100 fg of C. sinensis genomic DNA and to detect a single egg of C. sinensis in 100 mg of stool samples. Then, LAMP assay was applied to human fecal samples collected from an endemic area of clonorchiasis in Korea. Using samples showing consistent results by both Kato-Katz method and real-time PCR as reference standards, the LAMP assay showed 97.1% (95% CI, 90.1–99.2) of sensitivity and 100% (95% CI, 92.9–100) of specificity. In stool samples with more than 100 eggs per gram of feces, the sensitivity achieved 100%. Due to the sensitive and specific detection of C. sinensis DNA in fecal samples, the LAMP assay can be applied in field laboratories as a powerful tool for diagnosis and epidemiological survey of clonorchiasis.
