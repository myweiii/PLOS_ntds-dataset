The nasopharynx hosts a community of microbes that first colonise us during infancy and that changes as we grow. Colonisation with certain species is a risk factor for developing respiratory infections such as pneumonia, while other species can have a protective influence. In this study we use molecular methods to identify the bacteria present in nasopharyngeal swabs taken regularly from children in a refugee camp in Thailand. The microbiota develops with age, with early colonisers such as Corynebacterium or Staphylococcus being eventually outgrown by Moraxella and an uncultured taxon described here as unclassified Flavobacteriaceae I. There is evidence in the cohort of Streptococcus pneumoniae being frequently carried and transmitted throughout the first two years of life. We found that the microbiota profiles were not unique or distinguishable between individuals in this study, which is unlike studies in high income, low density populations.
