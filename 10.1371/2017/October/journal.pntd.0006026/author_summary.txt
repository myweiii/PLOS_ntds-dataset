Leishmania are auxotrophic for many essential nutrients, including amino acids. In this way, the parasite needs to uptake the amino acids from the environment. The uptake of amino acids is mediated by amino acid transporters that are unique for Leishmania. As part of polyamine pathway, the arginase converts L-arginine to ornithine and furthermore to putrescine, products which are essential for parasite growth. On the other hand, the absence of arginase activity could alter the metabolism of the parasite to surpass the external signals during the life cycle and the fate of infection. The transcriptional profiling of La-WT and La-arg- promastigotes and axenic amastigotes revealed 8253 transcripts, 60% encoding hypothetical proteins and 443 novel transcripts. In addition, our data revealed that 85% of the genes were constitutively expressed. Among the 15% (1268 genes) of the differentially expressed genes, we identified genes up- and down-regulated comparing the transcript abundance from different life cycle stages of the parasite and in the presence or absence of arginase. We also combined the transcriptional with metabolic profile that revealed a proportional correlation between enzyme and metabolites in the polyamine pathway. The differentiation of promastigotes to amastigotes alters the expression of enzymes from polyamines biosynthesis, which modulates ornithine, L-glutamate, proline and putrescine levels. In addition, the absence of arginase activity increased the levels of L-arginine, citrulline and L-glutamate and decreased the levels of aspartate, proline, ornithine and putrescine in promastigotes by differential modulation of genes involved in its metabolism. Altogether these data provided additional insights into how Leishmania is able to modulate its biological functions in the presence or absence of arginase activity to survive during environmental changes.
