Ebola viruses cause severe hemorrhagic fevers, and were responsible for the devastating Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. While a number of experimental therapeutics against these viruses target the viral polymerase, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge regarding this essential viral protein. In particular, until now no experimental evidence has been provided identifying the catalytic center of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is absolutely essential for the virus life cycle due to its role in replicating and transcribing the viral negative-sense RNA genome. Based on a comparison to related negative-sense RNA viruses from other virus families we identified a putative catalytic center within the Ebola virus polymerase, and provide the experimental evidence that the Ebola virus polymerase indeed utilizes a classical GDNQ motif for both genome replication and transcription. This finding not only increases our knowledge regarding the molecular biology of Ebola viruses, but also defines a molecular target for the development of antivirals against this deadly virus.
