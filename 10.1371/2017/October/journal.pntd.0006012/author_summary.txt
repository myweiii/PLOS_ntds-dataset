Helminths are known for their ability to alter the hostâ€™s immune response in order to promote their survival. One such mechanism is the propensity of helminths to secrete molecules with immunomodulatory activity; such molecules alter various aspects of host immunity to the benefit of the parasite. Following detailed characterisation of the secretome, we have identified that Cyclophilin A is secreted from adult Schistosoma mansoni and that the protein has the capacity to alter dendritic cell and T cell function in vitro by inducing a T cell regulatory phenotype.
