Anthrax is a soil-borne zoonotic disease found worldwide. In the West African nation of Ghana, anthrax outbreaks occur annually with a high burden to livestock keepers and their animals. To control anthrax in both humans and animals, annual livestock vaccination is recommended in endemic regions. However, in resource poor areas distributing and administering vaccine is difficult, in part, due to underreporting, logistical issues, limited resources, and an under appreciation of the geographic extent of anthrax risk zones. Our objective was to model high spatial resolution anthrax outbreak data, collected in Ghana, using a machine learning algorithm (random forest). To achieve this, we used a combination of climatic and environmental characteristics to predict the potential environmental suitability of anthrax, map its distribution, and identify livestock and human populations at risk. Results indicate a marked ecological divide separating the broad areas of environmental suitability in northern Ghana from the southern part of the country, which closely mirrors the ecotone transitions from southern tropical and deciduous forests to the northern Sudanian and Guinea Savanna. Based on our model prediction, we estimated >3 million combined ruminant livestock and low income livestock keepers are situated in anthrax risk zones. These findings suggest a low level of annual livestock vaccination coverage among high risk groups. Thus, integrating control strategies from both the veterinary and human health sectors are needed to improve surveillance and increase vaccine dissemination and adoption by rural livestock keepers in Ghana and the surrounding region.
