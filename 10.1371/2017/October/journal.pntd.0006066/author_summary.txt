Lymphatic Filariasis (LF, also known as “elephantiasis”) is a disabling and deforming tropical disease caused by parasitic worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. The Sri Lankan Anti-Filariasis Campaign provided 5 annual rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole between 2002 and 2006 in all endemic areas, and this reduced infection prevalence to very low levels. Post-MDA surveillance conducted by our group in 19 sentinel sites in 8 endemic districts in 2011–2013 revealed evidence of persistent LF infection in all study sites. The present paper reports results of repeat assessments conducted 3–4 years later in 6 areas with high signals in the prior study. LF parameters were significantly improved in 3 areas where LF appears to be on a glide path to elimination. However, LF infection parameters remained high in 3 areas, and further work will probably be required to interrupt transmission in these areas. Molecular xenomonitoring (to detect filarial DNA in mosquito vectors) was especially sensitive for detecting persistent LF in Sri Lanka, and this may also be true in other areas with Culex transmission. Our results suggest that test and treat or other programs targeting adult males plus expanded bed net use may be helpful for clearing up remaining LF hotspots.
