Babesia bovis, is a tick borne apicomplexan parasite responsible for important cattle losses globally. Babesia parasites have a complex life cycle including asexual replication in the mammalian host and sexual reproduction in the tick vector. Novel control strategies aimed at limiting transmission of the parasite are needed, but transmission blocking vaccine candidates remain undefined. In this study we analyze the conservation and role of the hap2 gene in the erythrocyte stage of the life cycle of the parasite and found that expression of the gene is not required for the development of the parasite in erythrocytic stages, using a hap2 mutated parasite line. In addition, we developed an in vitro system for the induction of sexual forms of B. bovis and found expression of the hap2 gene and surface localization of the protein. However, hap2-KO parasites are unable to develop sexual stages. We concluded that HAP2 is a leading candidate for a transmission blocking vaccine against bovine babesiosis due of the high level of conservation, surface exposure, and specific expression in tick stage and in in vitro induced sexual stages parasites.
