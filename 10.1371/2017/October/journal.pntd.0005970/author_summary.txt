Chagas disease is an important public health problem in most of Latin America, including Ecuador. It is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which in endemic areas is transmitted mainly by the feces of insects called triatomines. Control efforts in the region have reduced the number of new cases of Chagas disease, but there is limited information in certain countries, such as Ecuador. We conducted the first province-wide entomological survey conducted in central coastal Ecuador and report the distribution of triatomines, their habitat and microhabitat preferences, and factors that favor their presence. The results of the study show that 4.5% of households in 78 rural communities harbor triatomine populations. Infestation is higher outside, than inside the houses, but is well established, as shown by the presence of inmature stages and eggs. These results, combined with recent reports of lack of effectiveness of insecticide spraying efforts in this region show the need for innovative approaches for vector control to reduce the high risk of infection to approximately 571,000 people living in rural areas of central coastal Ecuador.
