We investigated the potential of non-host odors from un-preferred animals, i.e. not fed upon, related to cattle, the waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa) which are common in tsetse habitats for their efficacy to protect cattle from tsetse flies that transmit nagana to cattle in Africa. The identified waterbuck repellent compounds comprising of geranylacetone, pentanoic acid, guaiacol and δ-octalactone (patent application) were dispensed on cattle (hosts) using innovative repellent dispensers that individual cattle wear encircling their necks. This study, which is the first of its kind, shows that the waterbuck repellent compounds can provide substantial protection to cattle from trypanosome infections by reducing disease levels >80% in protected animals. Thus, by mimicking the odor profile of waterbucks, ‘cows in waterbuck clothing’ are essentially turned into non-hosts for tsetse flies and thus provide a new paradigm for innovative vector control. In our trial, protection of cattle with the repellent collars resulted in considerably improved food security as a result of significant reduction in trypanocide use, improved health of the protected animals which enhanced traction power with more land being brought under cultivation. Farmers’ perceptions of the repellent collars are very positive and socioeconomic studies indicate that adoption potential is extremely high.
