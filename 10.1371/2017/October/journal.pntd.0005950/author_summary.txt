This article presents the spatial and temporal distribution of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Minas Gerais State and identifies the greater risk areas of transmission. This study is both timely and substantive because Minas Gerais is an important Brazilian state in the number of cases of visceral leishmaniasis. The results showed that during the 12-year time series the VL had a heterogeneous spatial and temporal distribution in the state of Minas Gerais. Among the 12 existing mesoregions, six (Central Mineira, Jequitinhonha, Metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Northwest of Minas, North of Minas, and Vale do Rio Doce) were responsible for the expansion and maintenance of VL in the state. Among them, the Vale do Rio Doce and Jequitinhonha mesoregions presented a considerable increase in the incidence rates of the disease in the last period. In the other six mesoregions only sporadic cases of the disease were reported during the study period. The results of in this study may contribute to a better understanding the dynamic of the disease in Minas Gerais. Also these findings can provide subsidies to assist the actions of the control program of VL.
