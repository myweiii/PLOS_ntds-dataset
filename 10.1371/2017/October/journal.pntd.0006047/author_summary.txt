The model presented here provides valuable epidemiological information on tick-borne relapsing fever in western North America. The inference gleaned from these models represents areas where human infection with B. hermsii is likely to occur. The predicted distribution of O. hermsi and B. hermsii may allow health officials to decrease human disease burden by implementing targeted surveillance efforts, thus better utilizing resources. The models we created predict the current distribution of O. hermsi and B. hermsii, as well as the predicted distribution in 2050 under medium and high greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration trajectories. Understanding how the distribution of the pathogen and its vector expand or contract in response to GHG concentrations is necessary for understanding human risk of infection with this debilitating disease both now and in the future.
