In Africa, significant efforts to control human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) over the past three decades have drastically reduced the prevalence of the disease and elimination seems today an achievable goal. However, potential animal reservoirs of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense may compromise this ambitious objective. In the Bonon and Sinfra HAT endemic foci in Côte d’Ivoire, no recent data are available about the prevalence of animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT). The aim of this study was to identify trypanosomes circulating in domestic animals in these two HAT foci using serological, parasitological and molecular tools. We showed that T. brucei s.l. and T. congolense were the most prevalent trypanosome species and that pigs and cattle were the most infected animals. Discordant results were observed between the T. b. gambiense specific molecular and serological tools and the presence of an animal reservoir for T. b. gambiense remains unclear. Nevertheless, improved control strategies can be proposed based on this study to reach HAT elimination and contribute to AAT control in the study areas.
