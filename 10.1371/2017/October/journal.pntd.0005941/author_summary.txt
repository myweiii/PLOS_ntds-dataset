Cholera is a major public health problem in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In Mozambique, annual outbreaks occur but the place and time may vary. Africhol was implemented in Mozambique in 2011 to generate more detailed information on disease burden and characteristics to support appropriate interventions for cholera control and prevention in the country. The study was conducted in six different zones, where patients with cholera symptoms seeking care at a health facility were asked questions on socio-demographic characteristics, their symptoms, and behaviors that may increase cholera risk. Stool samples were also taken to test for the presence of cholera infection (Vibrio cholerae). Among the 1,863 patients, more than half were tested for cholera, and among those tested, less than one in four was infected with the pathogen. About 1% of patients died from cholera. Our study helps to understand the burden of cholera in different areas of the country, and the characteristics of the people infected. It is important to continue the surveillance of this disease to choose the most appropriate control and preventive interventions, and to apply them in precisely the right place.
