In African trypanosomes, many of the mitochondrial mRNAs require extensive RNA editing before they can be translated. During this process, each edited transcript can undergo hundreds of cleavage/ligation events as U-residues are inserted or deleted to generate a translatable open reading frame. A major paradox has been why this incredibly metabolically expensive process would evolve and persist. In this work, we show that many of the mitochondrial genes in trypanosomes are dual-coding, utilizing different reading frames to potentially produce two very different proteins. Access to both reading frames is made possible by alternative editing of the 5â€™ end of the transcript. We hypothesize that dual-coding genes may work to protect the mitochondrial genes from mutations during growth in the mammalian host, when many of the mitochondrial genes are not being used. Thus, the complex RNA editing system may be maintained because it provides a unique molecular strategy to combat genetic drift.
