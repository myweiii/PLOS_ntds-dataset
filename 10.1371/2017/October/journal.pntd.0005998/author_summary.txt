There are many examples of recent emergence of mosquito-borne viruses, such as chikungunya virus outbreaks throughout the Caribbean in 2013, Zika virus outbreaks throughout Southern and Central America in 2015, and yellow fever virus in Brazil in 2017. Each outbreak draws attention to the limits associated with predicting future outbreaks. This study expands our understanding of risk factors for exposure to two common genera of mosquito-borne viruses, alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Risk factors identified include simple demographic factors, such as age or sex, and behaviors associated with occupation or livelihood around the home. Behaviors enhancing or limiting contact with mosquitoes are also significant predictors, as mosquitoes drive transmission. More clearly defining the epidemiology of these infections within a population can elevate the accuracy and efficacy of public health initiatives that fuel community education and awareness, and outbreak prediction and monitoring can be elevated to a new level of accuracy and efficacy.
