Aedes albopictus, the Asian Tiger Mosquito, is a highly invasive disease vector with a growing global distribution. Designing strategies to prevent invasion and to control Ae. albopictus populations in invaded regions requires knowledge of how Ae. albopictus disperses. Studies comparing Ae. albopictus populations have found little evidence of genetic structure even between distant populations, suggesting that dispersal along human transportation networks is common. However, a more specific understanding of dispersal processes has been unavailable due to an absence of studies using high-resolution genetic markers. Here we present a study using high-resolution markers, which investigates genetic structure among 152 Ae. albopictus from Guangzhou, China. We found that human transportation networks, particularly shipping terminals, had an influence on genetic structure. We also found genetic distance was correlated with geographical distance, the first such observation in this species. This study demonstrates how high-resolution markers can be used to investigate ecological processes that may otherwise escape detection. We conclude that strategies for controlling Ae. albopictus will have to consider both passive reinvasion along human transportation networks and active reinvasion from neighbouring regions.
