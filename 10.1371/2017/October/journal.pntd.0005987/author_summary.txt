Chikungunya is a disease caused by a virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. During the past years, major outbreaks of chikungunya have occurred in the Americas. Normally, chikungunya presents with an acute, fever-like disease. After acute disease, many people develop chronic disease manifestations, which are mainly characterized by joint pain. In this study, we examined the impact of chikungunya on quality of life and how people coped with these consequences. The results of this study show that people infected with chikungunya reported long-term pain and limitation of mobility. Consequently, impairment of normal daily life activities and several emotions were experienced; for example dependency, moodiness, and insecurity about their livelihood and their future. People narrated visiting a doctor and using treatment to cope with these consequences. However, the participants who accepted their chronic ‘diseased’ condition could better cope with the consequences of chikungunya than the participants who could not accept their chronic condition. The latter group kept searching for new treatments and frequently consulted doctors. It is important that doctors and health authorities are aware of these results, because this will aid them to improve care and promote better coping strategies of people affected by chikungunya.
