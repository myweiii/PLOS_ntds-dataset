Typhoid/paratyphoid fever imposes a major global burden, specifically in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). However, it is challenging to implement evidence-based decisions for treatment and prevention because of lack of data from comprehensive surveillance systems, which are often expensive and difficult to sustain. The WHO has established a global surveillance program called “Invasive Bacterial–Vaccine Preventable Diseases (IB-VPD) Surveillance” to capture sepsis, meningitis and pneumonia in under-five children in many LMICs. Data generated by this program have facilitated introduction of live-saving vaccines and development of treatment strategies. However, the program does not include typhoid/paratyphoid surveillance. We tested the feasibility and sustainability of integrating typhoid/paratyphoid surveillance into this program in two leading children’s hospitals in Bangladesh. By monitoring all patients with signs of typhoid/paratyphoid, we captured 471 laboratory-confirmed episodes in under-five children between Jan 2012 and Dec 2016. Blood culture results from all in-patients revealed that the proposed expanded surveillance captures 94% of hospitalized typhoid/paratyphoid cases. Thirty-six percent (170/471) of 2–59 m cases were in children <2 years. Overall, age distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns were consistent with data generated from larger, expensive and typhoid-specific surveillance programs in the region, adding credence to the proposed integration. Adding typhoid/paratyphoid surveillance to an established invasive disease surveillance platform took advantage of existing infrastructure and resources and as such was easy and cost-effective to implement. We recommend that WHO considers similar integration in other countries; data generated from such surveillances will help countries make evidence-based decisions on introduction of upcoming vaccines and prepare for impact studies.
