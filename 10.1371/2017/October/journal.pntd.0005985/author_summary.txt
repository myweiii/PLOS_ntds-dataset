Yaws is a non-venereal treponemal infection. The disease is targeted by WHO for eradication by 2020. Testing is envisaged for diagnosis to confirm of clinical cases during treatment campaigns and for surveillance to certify the interruption of transmission. However resources available to the global eradication programme are severely limited and the cost of testing must be contained. Testing requires simultaneous detection of antibodies to both treponemal and non-treponemal antigens for diagnosis of active infection. Currently, there is one commercially available rapid diagnostic test for yaws that can do just that. However, it is considerably more expensive than the available syphilis tests detecting treponemal antibodies only. We evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a sequential testing strategy (using the treponemal test first, before the combined test), relative to a combined testing strategy (using only the combined test). We consider the two use cases: individual diagnosis and community surveillance. We find that the sequential strategy is cost-saving for both diagnosis and surveillance in most relevant settings. Yaws eradication programme should consider adopting the sequential strategy. Still, a cheaper trep/non-trep RDT is needed, costing no more than US$ 0.50â€“1.00. Our results will help enhance the cost-effectiveness of yaws programmes in the 13 countries known to be currently endemic. It will also inform efforts in the much larger group of 71 countries with a history of yaws, many of which will have to undertake surveillance to confirm the interruption of transmission.
