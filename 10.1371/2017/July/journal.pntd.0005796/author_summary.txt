Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease that affects about 7 million people in Latin America, being considered one of the most important neglected diseases of developing countries. Chronic Chagas disease might be present in different forms as an asymptomatic indeterminate form or even with severe cardiac commitment, known as chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. In fact, the cardiac form can lead to death due to disease progression. Seeking for biomarkers of cardiomyopathy progression has become important to understand the cardiac progression and to predict or even prevent the disease worsening and to improve the quality of life of affected individuals. In this work, we followed the anti-T. cruzi antibody profile in a retrospective longitudinal study in a cohort of chronic Chagas disease patients, and further correlate with heart commitment and cardiac disease progression. We found an inverse correlation between anti-T. cruzi IgG1 titers and cardiac disease severity in patients with progressive disease. These data suggest that anti-T. cruzi IgG1 levels could be considered a suitable candidate tool for early identification of cardiac disease progression.
