We would like to thank the study participants in TZ and SA for their willingness to donate blood samples for these studies. The invaluable work of Julian Rothen and Tobias Schindler in establishing the helminth infection status of the Tanzanian cohort in Bagamoyo is acknowledged. Isabelle Zenklusen, Philipp MÃ¤chler, Federica Klaus and Jerry Hela facilitated clinical data cleaning and entry of the Tanzanian patients.
