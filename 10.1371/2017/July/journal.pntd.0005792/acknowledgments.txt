We would like to sincerely thank populations of the Mandoul focus, and particularly those from the village of Kobitoye for their help during the fatal accident. Also thank to the staff of the Bodo hospital for taking in charge, all the victims of the bees attack. We are grateful to the hierarchy of IRED, PNLTHA, CIRDES, IRD and LSTM who morally supported us during this tragedy, support without which we would have given up. May Ali rest in peace. The authors would also like to thank Matt J Keeling for his role in the original development of the mathematical model, which is adapted here for this analysis.
