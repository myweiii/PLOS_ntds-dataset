Intestinal schistosomiasis is among the most important parasitic disease caused by helminthes, affecting 67 million people worldwide. Vector and intermediate host of the parasitic worm are fresh water snails. WHO recommends use of molluscicides for control of local transmission. Among those, natural plant extracts such as Euphorbia milii latex have attracted particular attention since they are sustainable and cheap. We had anecdotic evidence that E. milii latex also impacts infection outcome if treated snails were infected with S. mansoni. We show here that transient exposure of the human dwelling larvae (cercariae) to the latex at doses that do not affect its infectivity has effects 60 days later on the morphology, physiology and fitness of the adult parasite worms. In order to generate insights into key metabolic pathways that lead to the observed phenotypes we used comparative transcriptomics and proteomics. We show that the effect of latex on the adult is not due to direct toxicity but it triggers an early change in developmental trajectory and perturbs cell memory, mobility, energy metabolism and other key pathways. We conclude that latex has not only an effect on the vector but applies also long lasting schistosomastatic action. The present work might also provide insights on targets with implications for developing new interventions for schistosomiasis control.
