Buruli ulcer (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans is effectively treated with rifampicin and streptomycin for 8 weeks but some lesions take several months to heal. We have shown previously that some slowly healing lesions contain the M. ulcerans toxin, mycolactone, suggesting continuing infection after completion of antibiotic therapy. In the present study we have determined how soon M. ulcerans was killed during antibiotic treatment using the M. ulcerans 16S rRNA assay combined with qPCR for IS2404 to detect live bacilli in clinical samples and investigated its influence on healing. This assay is more sensitive than culture for the organism. Using samples collected from one hundred and twenty-nine BU patients prior to antibiotic treatment, viable organisms were detected by culture in 34% but the 16S rRNA assay was positive in 65%. The 16S rRNA remained positive in 78% of patients with unhealed lesions at 4 weeks, 52% at 8 weeks, 23% at 12 weeks, and 10% at week 16. Lesions with positive 16S rRNA after antibiotic treatment also contained a higher number of bacteria at baseline, had a lower rate of healing at week 4 and took a longer time to heal compared with those in which the organism was undetectable at baseline or by week 4. Positive 16S rRNA was less likely in ulcerative compared with nodular forms of disease 4 weeks after antibiotic treatment. It may be possible to shorten the treatment to 4 weeks in patients with low numbers of bacteria at baseline. Since persistent infection appears to contribute to slow healing, some patients with a high bacterial load at baseline may need antibiotic treatment for longer than 8 weeks.
