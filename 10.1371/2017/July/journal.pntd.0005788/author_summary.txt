Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a deforming and disabling infectious disease manifested in the form of elephantiasis and hydroceles. Based on mapping data, 61 out of 75 districts of Nepal were found to be endemic for LF and mass drug administration (MDA) of diethylcarbamazine and albendazole has been already started in 56 districts. The objective of MDA is to interrupt transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti in LF endemic districts. In 2015, ten districts had completed six MDA rounds. In this study we reported the impact of the national LF elimination effort in these ten districts of Nepal. The reported coverage rate in each MDA round was consistently above 65% in five districts. Compared to the baseline surveys, pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS) conducted after completion of five MDA rounds showed reductions in LF antigenemia (Ag) in most districts. Six out of ten districts (formed into six evaluation units) were eligible for TAS, which showed LF Ag below the cutoff point in all six EUs, suggesting successful interruption of LF transmission in six out of ten districts after six MDA rounds.
