Outbreaks of yellow fever and dengue caused by Aedes mosquitoes have been repeatedly reported in rural and urban areas in humid tropical Africa, including Côte d’Ivoire. Although controlling immature stages of Aedes mosquitoes in their aquatic habitats before they become adult vectors remains the best method to fight arboviral diseases, failure to identify the larval habitats can compromise intervention success. We studied the larval ecology of Aedes mosquitoes in different settings (rural, suburban, and urban) in Côte d’Ivoire. We found that the degree of urbanization was significantly associated with Aedes breeding sites. Compared with rural areas, urban and suburban areas were characterized by high numbers of Aedes mosquito breeding sites; mostly artificial containers (e.g., tires and discarded containers) that were inhabited by the larvae of Ae. aegypti. In rural areas, natural containers (e.g., tree holes and bamboos) harbored several other Aedes species not found elsewhere. Our results suggest that removal of discarded containers–a common practice in arbovirus control programs–in urban areas does not suffice for controlling arboviral diseases because urban areas remain exposed to (re)infestation due to natural containers that host several Aedes species in rural areas. Additional vector control strategies are required.
