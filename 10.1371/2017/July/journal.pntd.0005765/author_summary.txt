Scrub typhus is a life-threatening disease, due to infection with O. tsutsugamushi, a Gram-negative bacterium that preferentially replicates in endothelial cells and professional phagocytes. Meningoencephalitis has been reported in scrub typhus patients and in experimentally infected animals; however, the neurological manifestation and its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we utilized our established mouse models of severe and self-healing scrub typhus and revealed infection dose-dependent alterations in the CNS. Following lethal and sublethal doses of infection with O. tsutsugamushi, infected brains showed strong expression of genes for proinflammatory cytokines and mediators, as well as increased activation of endothelial cells and microglial cells/monocytes, accompanied with foci of vascular damage. Importantly, vascular leakage and inflammation in the CNS of infected mice were positively linked to the selective activation of type 1 cytokines, but suppression of type 2 cytokines, in inflamed lung tissues. Together, our data reveal type 1-skewed neuroinflammation and foci vascular leakage in the brain, mostly due to immune dysregulation and acute damage in the peripheral organs. This study improves our understanding of disease mechanisms and opens new avenues for the exploration of treatment options.
