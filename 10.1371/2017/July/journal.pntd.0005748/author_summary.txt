Lymphatic filariasis (LF) can cause disabling conditions in infected patients including lymphoedema-elephantiasis (LE) and hydrocoele. Identifying the number and locations of these patients is the first step towards ensuring that these patients receive the care they require, however there is currently no standardised approach for this essential action. This paper presents a health community-led approach for rapidly identifying patients in urban areas using an SMS reporting system, MeasureSMS-Morbidity, that allows health workers to report individual-level patient information (age, sex, location, condition, severity), which can be then be viewed in real-time via a web browser. The quality of the data can be easily monitored during the data collection period, and there is instant availability of patient information. This system is used here in the large urban centre of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A total of 6889 patients were identified, equating to 80.9 hydrocele patients per 100,000 population, 43.7 LE patients per 100,000 people, and 9.1 patients with both conditions. This information is now enabling the national neglected tropical disease (NTD) program to provide the essential care facilities and training for LF healthcare in locations in the city where it is most needed.
