While Loa loa, or the “African eye worm”, does not commonly cause clinical disease, infection with high blood levels of microfilariae from this helminth infection is problematic in those who receive mass drug administration (MDA) in the eradication efforts of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. Ivermectin, the drug of choice for both MDA programs, causes a rapid killing of Loa loa microfilariae and in those with high pre-treatment levels, a severe inflammatory reaction can result in encephalopathy, and rarely death. Using the filariae Brugia malayi as an in vitro surrogate model for any of the blood-borne filarial parasites (including Loa loa) we have previously shown that imatinib can act as a slow microfilaricide. Understanding imatinib’s targets in adult and microfilariae may predict the in vivo effects on Loa loa microfilarial loads, and anticipate potential side-effects for future clinical trials. In this study, we localized c-Abl, the target of imatinib, to the reproductive structures of adult B. malayi, and to the nuclei of the microfilariae. Pharmacologically achievable levels of imatinib most strikingly caused necrosis of developing microfilariae in adult female B. malayi. These data further support pursuing clinical trials in the safety and efficacy of imatinib for Loa. loa and other filarial co-infections.
