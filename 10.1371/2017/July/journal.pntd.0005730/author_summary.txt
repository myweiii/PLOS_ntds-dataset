Tsetse flies are the vectors of human and animal African trypanosomiasis. The flies rely solely on vertebrate blood for food and water and changes in vertebrate host density may therefore influence tsetse survival. We develop models including starvation-dependent mortality to explain changes in numbers of the savannah tsetse Glossina morsitans morsitans caught during a host elimination experiment in Zimbabwe in the 1960s. Our models provide a way of exploring the role of host density on tsetse population dynamics and could be incorporated into models of trypanosome transmission dynamics to better understand how spatial and/or temporal variation in host density impacts prevalence of trypanosome infection in vertebrate hosts.
