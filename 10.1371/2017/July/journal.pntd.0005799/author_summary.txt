Aedes aegypti is the major mosquito vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika worldwide. After its introduction in Madeira, it took a few years for the first dengue outbreak to occur in the region. Control strategies rely mostly on the use of insecticides but their efficiency is often being hampered by the ability of mosquitoes to resist to the compounds used. In fact, previous vector control programs using insecticides failed to eradicate, or even, to limit the spread of Ae. aegypti in Funchal, and now, the mosquito is widely distributed throughout the southern coast of the island. Bioassays to determine insecticide susceptibility profiles were carried-out in two populations of Madeira Island and the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed insecticide resistance phenotype were investigated. Transcription levels of detoxification genes were analysed, and screenings for kdr mutations, V1016I and F1534C, associated with pyrethroid resistance were performed. Our study showed the up-regulation of several detoxification genes of multiple enzyme families associated with metabolic resistance, and the presence of the two kdr mutations, with the F1534C being fixed. Another suggested mechanism probably involved in the resistance phenotype is cuticle thickening, as several cuticle genes were found overexpressed. This study reinforces the importance of alternative control strategies to suppress Ae. aegypti population and thus reduce the likelihood of arbovirus transmission in the region.
