Yaws, a bacterial skin infection, is endemic in Ghana. WHO has launched a campaign to eradicate yaws based on community mass treatment with the antibiotic azithromycin. Community perceptions of disease are an important contributor to participation in mass treatment interventions. This study used questionnaires to understand beliefs about yaws amongst individuals living in endemic communities in Ghana. Most individuals reported that ‘germs’ were the cause of yaws although the route of transmission was less well understood with many individuals reporting that dirty drinking or washing water was responsible for transmission. Participants reported they would normally seek care within the formal healthcare sector although many individuals reported they would visit traditional healthcare providers or pharmacies. Cost of care was the key factor for many participants. A majority of individuals reported they would be happy to take an antibiotic to prevent infection but a large minority (38.8%) reported that they would not. This study provides the first data on community beliefs about yaws in Ghana and will be valuable in helping the Ghana Health Service and partners develop community mobilisation tools to support yaws eradication efforts worldwide.
