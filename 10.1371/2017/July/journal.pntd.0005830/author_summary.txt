Pathogenic Leptospira causes the life-threatening infection called leptospirosis worldwide. Symptoms of leptospirosis range from mild illness to severe illness such as organ damage, meningitis, and fatal hemorrhagic disease. Invasive species of Leptospira spread to multiple tissues, and damage the linings of blood vessels. Despite the burden in humans and animals, how Leptospira bacteria cause damage remains to be determined. In this study, human endothelial cells were infected with L. interrogans (pathogen) or L. biflexa (non-pathogen) to investigate changes to host cell proteins. Among those analyzed, 17 proteins from five biological classes demonstrated distinctive changes upon infection with Leptospira. Infection with the pathogenic strain most profoundly disturbed the adherens junction group of proteins that hold neighboring cells together. In addition to the changes in cell-cell junctions, Leptospira infection, regardless of pathogenic status, influenced other host proteins belonging to multiple biological classes. Our data suggest that L. interrogans may damage endothelial cells via multiple cascades or pathways. The damage may include endothelial barrier disruption and inflammation, potentially leading to leaky blood vessels in patients. This work contributes to our understanding of how of Leptospira causes widespread, disseminated infection and disease in humans and animals.
