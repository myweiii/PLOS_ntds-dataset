Opisthorchiasis caused by Opisthorchis felineus is a fish-borne parasitic worm infection spread in Russia and some European countries. The morbidities provoked by O. felineus infection are cholangitis and bile duct fibrosis. Long-term infection is associated with high risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma, a generally incurable bile duct cancer type. Due to lack of specific symptoms, O. felineus infection often escapes detection. Thus, opisthorchiasis diagnosis, especially in non-endemic regions, is a serious problem for physicians. In the paper, an animal model of O. felineus induced opisthorchiasis has been evaluated by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Application of MR-techniques allowed to detect a characteristic MRI pattern of O. felineus infected liver, get valuable information about the severity of organ impairments, and bring to light some metabolic changes provoked by the helminth in the liver. Since damages take place in different liver lobes, MRI has the potential to overcome sampling variability of liver biopsy that limits liver fluke-induced fibrosis staging. The use of MR-techniques is very advantageous for investigating parasitic infection. Collection of experimental MR-data gives a new impulse to examination of infected humans and encourages to implement these methods in routine diagnosis of infections, including but not limited to opisthorchiasis.
