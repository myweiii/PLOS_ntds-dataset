Vector-borne viruses have immense impacts on human health by causing mortality and morbidity. Control of diseases caused by these viruses have mostly concentrated on vector control or inhibition of virus transmission by the vectors. This requires a thorough understanding of vector-virus interactions. In this study, we investigated the RNA interference (RNAi) response in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the Zika virus (ZIKV) strain isolated from the current pandemic using deep sequencing technologies. We found that infection alters the microRNA (miRNA) profile between infected and uninfected mosquitoes and that changes in miRNA expression occur over time. The short interfering RNA pathway, which is the main mosquito defense as part of the RNAi pathway, was also induced by ZIKV infection with the number of short interfering RNAs increasing significantly as infection progressed. Our results indicate that ZIKV induces the mosquito host defense similar to infection with other flaviviruses.
