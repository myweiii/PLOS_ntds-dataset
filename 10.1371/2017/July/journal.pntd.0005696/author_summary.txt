Time series analysis of dengue disease case counts are currently employed to establish associations between dengue disease and environmental, socioeconomic and climatic variables and to predict the evolution of dengue epidemics. Nowadays there is acceptance that climatic factors like environmental temperature, rainfall and relative humidity modify the behavior of the dengue vectors, affecting the transmission of the disease. Thus, in the absence of vector data, climatic factors are commonly used to input transmission models of dengue disease on several temporal and spatial scales. We applied hierarchical Bayesian dynamic generalized models to dengue diseases case counts in a medium-sized city in Colombia, with constant and time-varying coefficients for calendar trend, and constant and time-varying coefficients for meteorological variables (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation and relative humidity). We selected a final model useful for exploring of the time-varying association between climatic variables and dengue, and the short-term out-of-sample predictions of dengue counts within the study period. We illustrate the modeling process so a data analyst on a multidisciplinary research team could integrate a time series model accounting for the time-varying nature of the data.
