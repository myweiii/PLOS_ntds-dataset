Scabies and impetigo are common skin infections in children across the developing world as well as in disadvantaged populations living in developed countries. In previous studies including Australian Aboriginal and Pacific Islander children the rates of impetigo and scabies were amongst the highest described worldwide. The complications of these skin conditions include invasive bacterial infection, chronic kidney disease and potentially chronic heart disease and thus the burden of sequelae is significant. There are simple therapies which are efficacious in treating scabies and impetigo yet there has been little progress in reducing the burden of complications in endemic settings. We demonstrate in this study that scabies and impetigo, in a region with high prevalence of these conditions, are often not recognised by clinicians and appropriate treatment is not prescribed as a result of this. This is likely because clinicians ‘normalise’ skin infection where it is highly prevalent and therefore do not offer therapy unless specifically asked. The findings of this study have significant implication for health policy in regions with high prevalence of scabies and impetigo where focus should be put on improving health care worker recognition and awareness as well as exploring alternative strategies to individual case management of skin infection. Moreover future research should be directed at exploring the barriers to clinician recognition and treatment of these conditions and assessing specific strategies to ameliorate these.
