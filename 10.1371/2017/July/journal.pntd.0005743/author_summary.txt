Human taeniid tapeworms comprise three species, Taenia solium, Taenia saginata and Taenia asiatica. Taeniasis is a meat-borne zoonosis transmitted by the consumption of cysticerci in raw or undercooked pork for T. solium and T. asiatica (liver) and in beef for T. saginata. Accidental ingestion of T. solium eggs by humans also results in the formation of cysticerci, often in the brain, referred to as neurocysticercosis (NCC). T. solium NCC is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality owing to epilepsy in many resource-poor communities. In animals, ingestion of eggs passed by humans results in organ and/or carcass condemnation and suboptimal economic outcomes for farmers. The accurate diagnosis of T. solium tapeworm carriers is essential to monitor the success of control programs. In areas where all three species of Taenia tapeworms occur together, conventional diagnostic methods are unable to distinguish between the different species of Taenia. In this study, we develop and apply a T3qPCR capable of detecting and discriminating all three-tapeworm species in stools in a rapid and high-throughput fashion, suitable for large-scale community surveys. The newly developed T3qPCR proved superior to previously developed immunodiagnostic and conventional microscopic-based tests in terms of diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and the ability to identify and distinguish human Taenia species. This qPCR assay facilitated the identification of T. asiatica tapeworms in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, for the first time.
