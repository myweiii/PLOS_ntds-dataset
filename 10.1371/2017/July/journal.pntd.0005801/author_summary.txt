Human alveolar echinococcosis is a severe zoonotic disease caused by the metacestode stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. The objective of this systematic literature review was to identify and summarize the current knowledge on potential risk factors associated with human alveolar echinococcosis. The categories of potential risk factors included dog-related factors such as dog ownership or play with dogs; vocational factors like being a farmer or handling foxes; human habits such as chewing grass; gender (being female) and socio-cultural factors like being Tibetan or having a low income or poor education, which may be relevant only in particular endemic areas. The identification of potential risk factors may help identify strategies that aim to decrease human infection with E. multilocularis.
