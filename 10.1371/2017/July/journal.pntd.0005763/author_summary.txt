Scrub typhus is a febrile illness that can be life-threatening without appropriate treatment. It is caused by a gram-negative, obligately intracellular bacterium, Orientia tsutsugamushi. Approximately one million people annually are infected globally, mainly in the Asia-Pacific area. Unfortunately, no vaccine has been developed for the prevention of the disease. There is very little known about the pathogenesis of or host immunity to scrub typhus. The limited number of studies on the mechanisms of immunity has failed to provide a fundamental explanation of the protective host immune response during the disease due in part to the outdated and inaccurate animal models employed. Here, we examined and confirmed that CD8+ T cells provide critical protection during the infection. Our data also demonstrated the potential contribution of non-CD8+ immune cells in protection against the infection. This study of host immune responses during scrub typhus with a more accurate mouse model improves the understanding of the interaction between the host and pathogen, and provides a foundation for future investigations of pathogenesis, immune control and prevention including vaccine development.
