Sub-Saharan Africa is home to nearly 90% of malaria cases. In Ethiopia, two-thirds of the population lives in areas at risk of malaria infection. Malaria spread via human migrations and emergence of drug resistant parasites are major issues to malaria control in this country. Our study used microsatellite markers to determine gene flow patterns of P. falciparum and P. vivax in different parts of Ethiopia. We found that gene flow occurred across broad geographical distance and that environmental heterogeneity did not appear to influence gene flow. Unconstrained parasite gene flow may partly explain similar patterns of resistance marker prevalence across the country. While no mutation was detected in pfK13 that relates to artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum, over 50% of our P. vivax samples had pvmdr1 976F mutation that may relate to chloroquine resistance. This merits further clinical observations and/or in vitro testing. Our findings heighten the concern of chloroquine resistance for P. vivax malaria after more than a decade-application and suggests alternative treatment regime to alleviate the problem. Broadly, malaria control efforts should focus on seasonal migrant populations to effectively reduce malaria burden in Ethiopia.
