Onchocerciasis is a human parasitic disease endemic across large areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 99% of the estimated 100 million people globally at-risk live. The microfilarial stage of Onchocerca volvulus causes pathologies ranging from mild itching to visual impairment and ultimately, irreversible blindness. Mass administration of ivermectin kills microfilariae and has an anti-fecundity effect on adult worms by temporarily inhibiting the development in utero and/or release into the skin of new microfilariae, thereby reducing morbidity and transmission. Phenotypic and genetic changes in some parasite populations that have undergone multiple ivermectin treatments in Cameroon and Ghana have raised concern that sub-optimal response to ivermectin's anti-fecundity effect may increase in frequency, reducing the impact of ivermectin-based control measures. We used next generation sequencing of small pools of parasites to define genome-wide genetic differences between phenotypically characterised good and sub-optimal responder parasites from Cameroon and Ghana, and identified multiple regions of the genome that differentiated the response types. These regions were largely different between parasites from these two countries but revealed common molecular pathways that might be involved in determining the extent of response to ivermectin's anti-fecundity effect. These data reveal a more complex than previously described pattern of genetic diversity among O. volvulus populations that differ in their geography and response to ivermectin treatment.
