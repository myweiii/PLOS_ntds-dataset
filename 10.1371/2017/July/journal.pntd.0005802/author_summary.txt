Rapid economic development in South-East Asia has resulted in a high demand for rubber, leading to the felling of natural forest and the expansion of rubber plantations. Hundred-thousands of people work in these man-made forests throughout the region, with some studies showing a higher risk of vector-borne diseases for rubber workers compared to typical village populations. In this study we assessed the risk of exposure to vector mosquitoes in relation to different typologies of human behavior. Whilst the highest risk of vector-borne diseases is in natural forest, those living and working in the rubber plantations are at higher risk of dengue and lower risk of malaria vector exposure than villagers that stay in the village. As dengue is endemic in our study area and malaria is not, rubber workers should be encouraged to live in the villages instead of plantations. Furthermore, vector-borne disease control in Lao PDR should broaden from its current focus on villages to include outdoor protection in both rubber plantations and forests, using larval control and personal protection methods.
