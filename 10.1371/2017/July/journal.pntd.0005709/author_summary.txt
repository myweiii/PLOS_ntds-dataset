Although tapeworm parasites of the genus Taenia are globally distributed and inflict enormous socioeconomic and health costs on their hosts, which include humans, little is known about taeniid tapeworms that infect wildlife. This gap in knowledge prevents an assessment of the potential for these parasites to infect humans and production animals and is largely due to the difficulty of conducting standard diagnostic tests on wildlife. To address this gap, we adapted a standard diagnostic assay to be used with dried urine samples. We used urine from geladas, primates endemic to Ethiopia, which are frequently infected with the larval stage of a taeniid tapeworm and exhibit protuberant cysts during advanced infection. The use of this diagnostic test in a wild gelada population allowed us to detect that individuals can be infected without exhibiting observable cysts, and that some individuals may control infection in its early stages. This tool provides information about how a neglected tapeworm functions in a wildlife system and opens the door to the non-invasive identification of tapeworm reservoir hosts that may threaten humans.
