Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by a parasite, Leishmania, belongs to the most neglected tropical diseases: they mainly occur in low-income countries and affect the poorest populations. The parasites are transmitted via the bite of an insect vector and migrate to the internal organs. When VL occurs, the patients will present with enlarged spleen and liver, a disturbed haematological profile with low blood cell counts, systemic inflammation and malnutrition. This stage of the disease is fatal if left untreated. The factors that influence VL disease severity are poorly characterized. Here, we recruited patients with VL in an area of Ethiopia with a high prevalence of intestinal parasites. Our aim was to assess whether the disease was more severe in VL patients co-infected with intestinal parasites. Our results show that clinical and haematological data, inflammation, cytokine profile and nutritional status of VL patients are similar in VL patients and in VL patients co-infected with intestinal parasites. These results suggest that co-infection of VL patients with intestinal parasites does not impact on disease severity.
