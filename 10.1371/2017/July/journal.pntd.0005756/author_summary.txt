Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that imparts a substantial burden to the economy and public health of pastoralist communities across the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. Furthermore, RVF is also an emerging pathogen of growing global concern. Knowledge of the epidemiological and ecological factors that influence the geographic distribution of RVF outbreaks and determine risk for humans and animals is incomplete. The current study examined the distribution of RVF outbreaks from 1998 to 2016 and modeled their occurrence as a function of climate, surface water, land cover, livestock density, wild mammalian species richness, and human migration. The results indicate that wetlands, Bovidae species richness, and sheep density were associated with increased risk of RVF outbreaks. Our findings contribute to improved understanding of the spatial and ecological dynamics of RVF risk with a particular emphasis on the distribution of wetlands and potential wildlife reservoirs in designing RVF surveillance programs.
