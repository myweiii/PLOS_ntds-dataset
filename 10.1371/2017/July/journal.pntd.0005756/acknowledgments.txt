We are grateful to the residents of Thin Keo, Silalek, and Houayhoy village for their hospitality and cooperation. We thank the district heads of Nane and Xieng Ngeun and the provincial head of Luang Prabang for their assistance. We could not have done this study without the support of our driver Hongnakhon Xayasing, nor with the helpful input from Sok Dara and Min Sophoan from Agronomes et Vétérinaires Sans Frontières (AVSF). We are appreciative for the input from Yves Froehlich and Julia Ledien from Institut Pasteur de Cambodge. Finally, we thank the staff of Institut Pasteur Laos for their commitment in helping establish and providing support throughout the study.
