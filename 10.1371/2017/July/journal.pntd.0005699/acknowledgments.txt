We are grateful to our informants for welcoming us home and sharing their knowledge of the bush with generosity and humour. We thank the staff of Mercy Hospital Research Hospital for their invaluable support, Matthias Borchert for his comments on the study design, and Julien Gavelle and Almudena Marí Sáez for their reflections during the fieldwork.
