Malaria is a disease of rural areas in developing countries. Although a rise in urban malaria cases has been noted during the last decade, this trend could be an artifact due to lack of solid data. In order to better understand “urban” and “peri-urban” malaria, we developed a rigorous and systematic methodology that allows characterizing malaria risk in such settings. Our approach is based on cross-sectional studies using active and reactive case detection strategies, genotyping of parasite isolates in order to better understand transmission patterns, and the local assessment of the entomological factors that allow active transmission in urban and peri-urban neighborhoods. This approach was tested in Quibdó, Colombia. No evidence of malaria transmission in urban areas was found. However, we found solid evidence indicating transmission in peri-urban areas due to Plasmodium vivax (86%). This was supported by the identification of Anopheles mosquitoes and their breeding places. Our results show that reactive case detection is not only an effective strategy to identify cases in areas where transmission is variable and unstable, but also allows the detection of hidden transmission when combined with genotyping methods. Such patterns are undetected by traditional surveillance methods.
