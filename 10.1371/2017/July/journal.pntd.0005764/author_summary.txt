Leishmaniasis is a well-known parasitosis due to an infection by the protozoan Leishmania parasites firmly established in South America. In French Guiana, where leishmaniasis is a public health problem, having an annual incidence of 5.6 cases/10,000 inhabitants, 80% of Leishmania spp. parasites are infected by an endosymbiotic virus, Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1). The purpose of this study was to gain insights on the genetic variability and evolution of LRV1 at the genomic level. We subjected 20 Leishmania isolates obtained from cutaneous lesions with next generation sequencing and de novo sequence assembly. This allowed generating 24 LRV1 full-length coding sequences presenting among themselves a significant genetic diversity. The inferred phylogenetic relationships enabled to identify distinct well-supported genotypes and support the hypothesis of co-evolution between LRV1 strains and their parasite hosts. In addition, we identified multiple LRV1 infections in three parasite isolates. Based on these data, future characterization of new strains from other geographic areas and other parasite species should extend knowledge of LRV1 diversification processes. Finally, these results allowed us to identify genomic regions where best to allocate resources for subsequent analyses of LRV1 viral diversity and genotyping that could serve for accurate routine molecular diagnostic applications.
