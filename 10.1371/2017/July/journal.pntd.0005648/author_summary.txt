Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread parasitic disease. In the event of primary infection during pregnancy, this parasite can be transmitted from mother to unborn child. Clinical presentation of congenital toxoplasmosis varies from asymptomatic to life-threatening risk for the fetus and infant and in later life. Prevention programs and screening strategies of health care providers vary in different countries. Austria has implemented mandatory prenatal screening for toxoplasmosis for four decades. The screening is free of charge for families and costs are covered by national health care providers. Compliance with the national program is good and outcomes for infected pregnant women and their infants since 1992 are well documented. We compared lifetime costs of screening, treatment, and follow-up with costs in a No-Screening scenario in an economic decision-analytic model. Prenatal screening resulted in substantial cost savings due to reduction in congenital toxoplasmosis and consequent injuries in affected children.
