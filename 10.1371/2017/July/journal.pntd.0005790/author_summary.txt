Bats make up a mega-diverse, intensely parasitized order of volant mammals whose unique behavioural and physiological adaptations promote infection by a vast array of microorganisms. Trypanosomes stand out as ancient protozoan parasites of bats. As cryptic morphology, low parasitaemia and selective growth in culture have recurrently biased survey, we used 18S ribosomal RNA metabarcoding to resolve bat trypanosomatid diversity in Atlantic Forest fragments of southeast Brazil. Next to several unknown species, our deep sequence-based detection and assignment protocol recognized multiple known human-pathogenic trypanosomes, another linked to reptile hosts as well as a non-parasitic kinetoplastid in the blood of various phyllostomid bats. The striking permissivity exposed here, in a region where bat trypanosomes recently featured in a fatal case of Chagas disease, compels further research on batsâ€™ role in the dispersal and spill-over of various microorganisms among humans and wildlife.
