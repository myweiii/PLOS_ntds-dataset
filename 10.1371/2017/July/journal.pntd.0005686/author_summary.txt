The Esperanza window trap (EWT), when used in large numbers (3-4/household and >90% coverage) and baited with human sweat compounds and CO2, can be used to collect epidemiologically significant numbers of Simulium ochraceum s.l., the primary vector of Onchocerca volvulus in the historically largest endemic foci in México and Guatemala. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of the EWT to reduce the personal biting rate by questing S. ochraceum s.l. in two formerly onchocerciasis endemic communities in Southern México. At each community, two EWTs were placed in or near a school or household and flies were collected sequentially for a total of 10 days. Black fly collections were then carried out for an additional 10 days in the absence of the EWTs. When the EWTs were present, there was a significant reduction in the human biting rate at each of the four collection sites, varying from 14% to 51%. This study demonstrates that the EWTs have potential both as a black fly monitoring and personal exposure reduction tool in Mesoamerica.
