For rabies prevention and control it is important that pets and domestic animals be vaccinated, this is especially relevant for rabies-free areas of the world which tightly control dog and cat entry to ensure rabies is not imported. Adequate response to rabies must be proven by testing the petâ€™s serum for rabies antibodies. Failure to produce an adequate antibody response is related to various factors such as pet health, vaccine type, timing of vaccination and subsequent blood sampling as well as age. Identifying the ideal vaccination and blood drawing schedules. Unique factors, such as maternal antibody interference, affect the ability of young dogs to mount a robust immune response to vaccination; this group of pets has not previously been studied. This study looked at rabies antibody result from dogs under one year of age after a single vaccination to determine the timing of vaccination and a blood sampling that ideally would ensure an antibody response sufficient to prove the vaccination was effective for rabies protection.
