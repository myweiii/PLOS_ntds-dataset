Urogenital schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease whose transmission depends on environmental factors. The disease is one of the risk factors of bladder cancer, the second most common urogenital cancer after prostate cancer in Nigeria. This study aims to identify area suitable for the transmission of the disease through the use of environmental factors. This was achieved by using spatial analysis and multicriteria evaluation for Akure North Local Government Area (LGA) of Ondo State, Nigeria. The results showed that a large portion of the study area was highly favourable for the transmission of the disease. Of the five communities in the study area, only one had a low risk of transmission of the disease while the risk of transmission increased in the remaining four communities. The predictions made by the model was comparable to observations from field study. This study confirmed that analysis of environmental factors using relevant techniques can be applied in the study of transmission of parasitic diseases.
