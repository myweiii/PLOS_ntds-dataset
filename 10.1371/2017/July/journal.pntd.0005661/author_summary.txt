Three Gorges Dam (TGD) is a tremendous hydrological project in China, it affects the ecological environment and influences the survival of animals downstream. The Dongting Lake is the first large lake that connects Yangtze River after it flows out of TGD, meanwhile, it accounts for 48% of the total snail habitation in China. Hydrological data from 12 monitoring sites, combined with data on snail distribution and human schistosomiasis infection, were used to assess the impact of TGD on ecological environment changes, snail distribution and schistosomiasis transmission in Dongting Lake area. Based on our analyses, following the establishment of TGD until 2015, the mean density of living snails in Dongting Lake area was under 5 snails/frame, and human infection rate of schistosomiasis declined to below 0.5%. As the impact of TGD on snail distribution and schistosomiasis prevalence in Dongting Lake area is much more complex in the real world, long-term monitoring and in-depth studies are still required.
