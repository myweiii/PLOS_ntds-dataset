Lymphatic Filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, infects an estimated 39 million people in 73 tropical and sub-tropical countries. The most severe clinical manifestations of the disease include swelling of the scrotal area and lower limbs (hydrocele and lymphedema). It is well admitted that host immune reactivity plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Previous investigations have linked the non-cytolytic antibody IgG4 to the hyporesponsive states in filarial infections. However, few data exist on how this antibody is involved in the pathogenesis of human filariasis. Here we investigated the role of this antibody in disease pathogenesis by comparing the effect of plasma, IgG and IgG4 fractions from the four clinical categories of individuals; chronic pathology individuals (CP), asymptomatic microfilaria positive (Mf+) and negative (Mf-) and uninfected endemic normal individuals (EN) on activated granulocytes. We could show that granulocyte activation was significantly inhibited in the presence of plasma from EN and Mf+ and that, affinity-purified IgG4 antibodies from EN, Mf+ and Mf- individuals inhibited granulocyte activation in a dose-dependent manner via the immune receptors FcγRI and FcγRII. Our data also reveal significant functional differences between IgG4 molecules from EN, Mf+, Mf- and CP.
