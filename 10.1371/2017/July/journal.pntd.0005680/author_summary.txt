Just one drug, praziquantel (PZQ), is available to treat schistosomiasis, a flatworm disease that infects over 240 million people, mainly in Africa. With the expanding distribution of PZQ, and the associated threat of drug resistance, new drugs and drug targets are needed. We screened Schistosoma mansoni worms with over 1,000 benzoxaborole chemical molecules from Anacor Pharmaceuticals to identify a subset of human cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 4 (huPDE4) inhibitors that cause parasite hypermotility and degeneration. We identified four PDE4 genes in the genome of the parasite and recombinantly expressed one of them (SmPDE4A) in bacteria. This enzyme was then used to uncover a relationship between the degree of enzyme inhibition, and the generation of parasite hypermotility and degeneration. To understand whether the SmPDE4A enzyme is the target of the benzoxaboroles in the parasite, we incorporated the coding DNA for SmPDE4A into the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that lacked its own functional PDE4 and, as a consequence, was hypermotile. These ‘transgenic’ worms displayed normal motility which could be increased by applying the most potent huPDE4 benzoxaborole inhibitors. In summary, the chemical, biological and genetic approaches taken identify SmPDE4A as a potential drug target for treating schistosomiasis. The potential value of C. elegans as a tool to test and optimize therapeutic chemistries for a flatworm disease is also highlighted.
