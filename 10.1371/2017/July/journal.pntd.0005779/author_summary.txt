Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite transmitted to humans from hematophagous insects, causes Chagas Disease, a Neglected Tropical Disease with public health impact, affecting 7 million people in Latin America. Although mainly related to low income populations inhabiting rural environments, migrations have conveyed Chagas Disease to urban areas of endemic and non-endemic countries. It often presents non-specific symptoms, and direct, low cost microscopy-based diagnosis only detects acute infections, missing a high proportion of cases. Serology is the “gold standard” diagnostic technique for chronic stages and needs the concordance of at least two different assays to confirm infection. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of a prototype kit based on a novel and rapid molecular biology reaction, named Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), using standardized Real Time PCR as a comparator. To our knowledge, this is the first LAMP prototype kit with an analytical performance appropriate for human diagnosis of Chagas disease and potentially useful for monitoring treatment response. Its simple handling using basic laboratory devices will enable point-of-care diagnosis and screening for congenital infection at birth as well as early detection of acute infections due to oral contamination.
