Roundworms (Ascaris) infect more than 700 million people living in poverty worldwide and cause malnutrition and physical and mental developmental delays in children. As an alternative or complementary approach to global deworming, a pan-anthelminthic vaccine is under development that targets ascariasis in addition to other human intestinal nematode infections. Towards this goal, two Ascaris suum antigens, As16 and As14, were expressed in Pichia pastoris as recombinant proteins. Mice immunized with rAs16 formulated with ISA720 adjuvant produced significant larva reduction (36.7%) and stunted larval development against A. suum egg challenge. The protection was associated with predominant Th2-type responses characterized by high levels of serological IgG1 (IgG1/IgG2a > 2,000) and Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5. A similar level of protection was observed in mice immunized with rAs16 formulated with alum that induces mainly a Th2-type immune response, whereas mice immunized with rAs16 formulated with MPLA or AddaVax, both inducing major Th1-type responses, were not significantly protected against A. suum infection. High-yield expression of rAs16 in yeast will allow for large-scale manufacture, and its protective efficacy when formulated with alum suggests its suitability as a vaccine candidate.
