Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic virus affecting livestock and people. Periodic outbreaks in Kenya are associated with greater than average rainfall, although outbreaks have not previously been reported in western Kenya. The virus is spread between animals and to people by mosquitos. Contact with infected animal tissues and products are also risk factors for transmission of RVFV to people. This study investigated the seroprevalence of RVFV in 1861 residents of western Kenya and compared this to the seroprevalence in 553 ruminant slaughterhouse workers. The seroprevalence of RVFV in people in western Kenya was less than 1%, which is consistent with previous reports from the region. Slaughterhouse workers were shown to be a higher risk group for RVFV seropositivity, with seroprevalence of 2.5%. The identification of plausible risk factors including slaughtering is consistent with reports from other regions. The results suggest that it is plausible that RVFV virus is circulating in western Kenya. Improved surveillance in low risk areas is recommended particularly during countrywide outbreaks.
