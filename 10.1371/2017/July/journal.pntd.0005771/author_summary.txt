CE is a neglected tropical disease that remains a considerable health problem in endemic regions and which leads to substantial economic losses for agriculture sectors and public health systems. The parasitic cycle requires a definitive host (canidae) and an intermediate host (livestock species), while humans are only occasionally hosts. CE is more prevalent in areas where extensive or semi-extensive farming of livestock (mostly sheep) is common. The study of prevalence and health expenditure at the national macro-regional and regional level is a prerequisite for creating awareness of the importance of this disease. The Italian Ministry of Health provides remuneration to its regions’ hospitals for treatment of illnesses. In this study 21,050 hospital discharge records with CE diagnosis from 2001 to 2014 related to 12,619 patients were analyzed. The median of CE hospitalizations per annum was 848. The direct costs of HDRs for echinococcosis were estimated to be € 53,175,934.34. The assessment of economic remuneration by Italian Regions grouped by Nomenclature of Territorial Units 1 (NUTS1) shows that Southern Italy and its major islands spent €13,523,999 and €15,171,739 respectively. The national annual average direct cost for 105 inhabitants was € 6,398. The study of the National DALYs, a measure of social burden of disease, shows that 41% was correlated to Island patients DALYs per annum are 223.4. An analysis of direct costs and an estimate of DALYs are key factors for establishing how to prioritize control measures for CE, which is essentially a preventable disease.
