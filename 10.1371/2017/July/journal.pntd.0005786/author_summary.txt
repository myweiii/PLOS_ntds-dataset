Fiji has experienced a decade-long increase in typhoid fever cases, a potentially life-threatening systemic bacterial disease caused by Salmonella Typhi. We undertook a representative blood-serum community survey to measure antibodies (IgG) against the Vi antigen of Salmonella Typhi using a rigorous survey design. We found one in three residents of mainland, unvaccinated Fiji had detectable antibody against Vi. This was higher than would be expected from confirmed case notifications received by the national surveillance system. Additionally, similar antibody responses were detected in Fijians of all ethnicities, which contrasts to surveillance cases in which indigenous iTaukei Fijians were disproportionately affected. Serology on a Fijian island where a significant proportion of the population has been vaccinated found that three-quarters of residents were seropositive three years after the Vi-polysaccharide typhoid vaccination campaign. Importantly, in mainland participants, seroprevalence increased with age, suggesting long-standing, low-level, endemic transmission. Pit latrines were associated with seropositivity when compared with septic tanks, and settlements compared with residential housing. Very high antibody titres in a small percentage of participants may suggest carriage of Salmonella Typhi. The seroprevalence findings suggest eliminating typhoid from Fiji by focussing on cases and outbreaks alone will be challenging. Our results support typhoid vaccination and further development of water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure in Fiji.
