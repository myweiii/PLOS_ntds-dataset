The emergence of mosquito-borne chikungunya virus in the Americas starting in 2013 has been associated with geographically widespread outbreaks of human illness. Transmission of chikungunya virus in the U.S. is a major public health risk, especially in Florida where the environmental conditions are favorable for the two main mosquitoes involved in transmission. We measured susceptibility to infection and transmission for Florida Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes for two emergent strains of chikungunya virus (Indian Ocean and Asian strains). Both mosquito species showed high susceptibility to infection and rapid spread of the virus throughout the body of the mosquito, including the saliva for both emergent strains of chikungunya virus. Aedes albopictus had higher body infection and transmission of the Indian Ocean strain sooner after feeding on chikungunya virus infected blood than Ae. aegypti. Aedes aegypti had higher body infection and saliva infection later during infection with the Asian strain of chikungunya virus than Ae. albopictus. We also observed declines in body infection and transmission over time, suggesting that transmission risk declines with length of infection. The information here will be useful as parameters in models of risk of chikungunya virus transmission.
