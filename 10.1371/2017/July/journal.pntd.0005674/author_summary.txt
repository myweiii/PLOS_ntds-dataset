Malaria elimination, i.e. the complete interruption of parasite transmission in a region, is in the agenda of health authorities in countries that achieved substantial reduction of the disease burden in the past decade. However, our understanding of transmission epidemiology for low transmission areas where Plasmodium vivax is endemic, like the Amazon basin, is still limited. In this study, we describe the prevalence and risk factors for carrying the parasite stages that are transmitted to the mosquito vectors, named gametocytes, in 1935 individuals from two communities of the Peruvian Amazon that were regularly screened during 1 year. We report that malaria infections with no clinical symptoms and those with parasite levels below microscopy detection threshold, account for two thirds of all P.vivax infections with gametocytes, and that the highest infection rate is found among young adults. In addition, almost the totality of P.falciparum infections detected was sub-microscopic. Because all these infections escape current malaria surveillance systems -based on passive case detection and/or microscopy diagnosis-, new approaches are necessary to target all infections in order to eliminate the malaria transmission reservoir in Peru.
