Typhoid fever is an (sub)acute febrile illness that remains an important global burden with more than 27 million cases worldwide each year and an estimated 217,000 deaths. During infection by Salmonella (S.) Typhi, the etiologic agent for typhoid fever, a cascade of antimicrobial functions is triggered and causes release of signaling and cytotoxic proteins for the rapid control of the infection.
Granzymes are proteins promoting cytotoxic lymphocytes mediated eradication of intracellular pathogens via the induction of cell death and which can also play a role in inflammation. In the present study we analyzed extracellular levels of different granzymes in healthy volunteers and patients with confirmed S. Typhi infection at the time of admission and discharge, as well as their correlation with levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, a cytokine significantly expressed in typhoid fever. Patients demonstrated a marked increase of extracellular released granzyme A and B in acute phase plasma, which correlated with IFN-γ levels, while granzyme B levels were associated with disease stage. Intracellular expression of both granzymes was also increased in patients compared to controls. In conclusion, granzymes are markedly elevated in human typhoid and correlate with stage of disease, suggesting their involvement in the host response to the disease.
