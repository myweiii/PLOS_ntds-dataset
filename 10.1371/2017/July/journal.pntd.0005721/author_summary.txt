Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are severe disease manifestations following secondary heterotypic dengue virus (DENV) infections. DENV infects almost 400 million people annually and there are currently no licensed therapies to treat DENV-induced disease. DHF and DSS are mediated by serotype cross-reactive antibodies that facilitate antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) by binding to viral antigens and then Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on surrounding cells. ADE results in a heightened immune response and in part mediates the pathogenesis of secondary DENV infections. Researchers have developed an animal model of ADE-induced severe DENV in which anti-DENV2 antibodies genetically engineered to eliminate FcR binding have therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy. Our study suggests that avian-derived anti-DENV2 IgY, without genetic modification, is able to provide protection both in vitro and against a lethal DENV challenge in vivo. IgY has emerged as an attractive, alternative therapeutic antibody because of its biological characteristics that enable it to prevent some of the adverse reactions that mammalian antibodies have when used for human immunotherapy. Specifically, IgY does not bind to mammalian complement or rheumatoid factor and has proven to be very safe for human consumption. Without modification, anti-DENV2 IgY can be rapidly produced and may serve as a good therapeutic option to treat dengue worldwide.
