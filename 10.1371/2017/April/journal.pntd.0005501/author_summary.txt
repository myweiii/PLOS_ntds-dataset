Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It affects 6â€“7 million people, mainly in Latin America. An initial asymptomatic phase make the infection go undiagnosed and untreated, silently progressing into its chronic stage. About 30% of the chronically infected patients end up developing life-threatening disruption of the heart and/or gut tissues. Two drugs are available but their efficacy diminishes the longer a person has been infected. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to achieve an early diagnosis to start treatment before symptoms advance. In the chronic stage parasite presence is intermittent and diagnosis is made by serological assays that detect parasite-specific immunoglobulins. Problem is that conventional serological techniques are laborious and require equipment and trained personnel unavailable in remote regions with high disease prevalence. To circumvent those inconveniences easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests were developed. They return results within an hour and some work with whole blood as sample allowing diagnosis out of digital puncture. We propose that conventional assays could be substituted by whole blood-friendly rapid tests in order to achieve a conclusive Chagas disease diagnosis in remote regions. This would ease access to treatment increasing adherence rates to it.
