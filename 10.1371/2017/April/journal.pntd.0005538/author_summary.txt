Turkey is one of the endemic countries for leishmaniasis, cutaneous and visceral. Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania tropica is a serious public health problem with more than two thousands of local cases each year. Moreover, with the civil war in Syria more than three million refugees were accepted to reside in different cities of Turkey. To date, several population genetic studies were performed using Turkish L. tropica isolates but all previously studied isolates were originating from the same geographical area thus population structure could not be revealed in detail for Turkey. The findings of this study suggests two new population structure for Turkey, which are consist of Syrian and Mediterranean isolates. Our findings provide important knowledge on epidemiology of L. tropica in Turkey and highlights the future role of L. tropica to Europe through the current wave of migration of infected people.
