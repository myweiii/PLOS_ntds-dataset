Schistosomiasis is a water-borne neglected infectious disease of poverty that has consistently plagued over 200 million helpless inhabitants of the tropics, particularly, sub-Sahara Africa. Under the auspices of different nomenclatures and affiliations, many control programmes based on Praziquantel have been inaugurated over the past decades. Bearing in mind that globally, schistosomiasis exist in focal pockets within peri-urban and rural settings, and the lowest cost of a generic 600-mg tablet is approximately US$ 0.08, it is imperative to focus control resources more on high risk settings. In order to identify such settings, rapid means of mapping schistosomiasis prevalence are carried out either with questionnaires or biomedical testing with reagent strips. Rapid assessment procedure for urinary schistosomiasis, the focus of this study, builds substantially on the perception of respondents about the disease through visible blood in their urine (where applicable). We conducted this present survey in 6 communities of Katsina State, northwestern Nigeria by interviewing and examining the urine of 1, 363 high schools students for the eggs of Schistosoma haematobium. A unique discovery in this survey was that contact with unwholesome water bodies, where properly defined, was significantly associated with urinary schistosomiasis, both as a single index and when combined with itching experience.
