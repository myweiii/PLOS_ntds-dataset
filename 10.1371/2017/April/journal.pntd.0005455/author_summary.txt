Many vector-borne parasites and arboviruses are transmitted by outdoor-biting mosquitoes, especially in the evenings and mornings, often despite high coverage of houses with insecticidal nets and residual sprays. The goal of the study was to measure the long-term durability of protection provided by a new, low-technology, passive emanator for the volatile pyrethroid transfluthrin against outdoor-biting mosquitoes. Treated hessian strips reduced exposure of users to three different types of vector mosquitoes by more than three quarters over the first year after treatment, and prevented more than 90% of bites on warmer nights when the active ingredient evaporated faster. Treated strips protected non-users against some vector mosquito species, as far away as 5m from the strip. Reassuringly, mosquitoes were not diverted to nearby unprotected individuals anywhere within an 80m radius. Transfluthrin-treated hessian strips may have considerable potential for integrated control of multiple vectors of filariasis, arboviruses and malaria, which are co-endemic in many tropical areas.
