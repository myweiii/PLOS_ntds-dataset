The recent outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in Western Africa highlights the urgent need to develop therapeutics to help quell this devastating hemorrhagic fever virus, especially in resource-limited areas around the globe. Here we show that apilimod, an investigational drug that was well-tolerated in phase 2 clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohnâ€™s disease, and psoriasis, is a strong inhibitor of both EBOV and Marburgvirus infections in multiple cell types. Further work shows that apilimod blocks the entry of EBOV particles into the host cell cytoplasm and that it does so by blocking the particles from reaching their normal portal of entry, in Niemann-Pick C1-positive endolysosomes. Our findings are consistent with the identity of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase as the molecular target of apilimod, as the kinase and its product phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate are required for the proper maturation of late endocytic organelles. Hence we propose that apilimod be further explored for repositioning as part of a therapeutic regimen to help ameliorate the sequelae of filoviral infections.
