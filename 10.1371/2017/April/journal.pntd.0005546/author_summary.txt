The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an aggressive mosquito that has expanded globally in the last century, chiefly due to the increase of human movements. It is a major public health concern due to its role in transmitting dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. Understanding how populations of Ae. albopictus are genetically related and how they have been introduced into new regions is important for controlling them and assessing their disease risk; few studies have explored this in the Indo-Pacific. In our study, we sampled a broader range of populations of Ae. albopictus in the Indo-Pacific to explore genetic patterns and to investigate the likely route of invasion through Australasia. We uncovered clear genetic groups throughout this region, but also found that some geographically distant populations are closely related, likely due to human-associated movements. We also found, that Ae. albopictus likely colonized New Guinea from mainland Southeast (SE) Asia before spreading to the Solomon Islands via either PNG or SE Asia. In contrast, the populations in Australiaâ€™s Torres Strait Islands were introduced from Indonesia. Interestingly, we found major genetic changes over time in some Torres Strait populations, less than a decade after its introduction, potentially reflective of a random reduction in genetic diversity (genetic drift) or a secondary invasion.
