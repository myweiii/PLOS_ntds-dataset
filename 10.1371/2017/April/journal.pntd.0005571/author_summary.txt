Not only does Burkholderia pseudomallei pose a public health challenge in Southeast Asia and northern Australia but in the United States (US) Bp is listed as a Tier-1 select agent. Tier 1 organisms have the potential to pose a severe threat to US public health and safety and policy makers mandated development of vaccines and therapeutics for them, including Bp. Mortality is most often caused by septic shock. Understanding the mechanisms by which a variety of Bp strains cause septic shock can reduce mortality associated with melioidosis but also allow for the rational design of effective vaccines.
