Visceral leishmaniasis is a fatal disease transmitted solely by the sandfly Phlebotomus argentipes in India. For decades, indoor residual spraying targeting sandflies with DDT has been the main control tool in the region. Emergence of DDT resistance has compromised this strategy and pyrethroids are now being implemented as alternative. Here, we describe the first molecular markers in sandflies for DDT and pyrethroid resistance. Two knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in the para voltage-gated sodium channel target site gene are found at high frequency in natural populations in Bihar, the Indian focus of VL. The kdr variants strongly predict DDT resistance in P. argentipes and survival to lower-level pyrethroid exposure. Careful monitoring of resistance, aided by these markers, and of spraying efficacy is required to monitor changes and forewarn of emergent higher-level pyrethroid resistance in the region.
