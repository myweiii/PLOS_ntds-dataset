After the introduction of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 to the Caribbean nation of Haiti in 2010, the country experienced the largest national cholera outbreak in recent history. With the help of the international community, over $500,000,000 USD was pledged to finance massive improvements in drinking water and sanitation infrastructure with the goal of eliminating cholera transmission by 2023. Over six years later, cholera transmission continues, with little evidence that any such improvements have been made. In this study, the use of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) to reduce the spread of the initial outbreak and to eliminate future transmission was investigated using a novel mathematical modeling framework. Critical parameters including vaccine efficacy, vaccine administration rates, and duration of protective immunity were evaluated to provide guidelines for the administration of a National Cholera Vaccine Program in Haiti. Provided the vaccines are at least 60% effective, all simulations of mass vaccination programs successfully eliminated cholera by 2023, most within a time frame of only a few years. Not only do the findings support the use of OCVs to eradicate transmission of cholera in Haiti, they indicate that OCVs should be mobilized to quash future outbreaks in other countries using active vaccine administration campaigns.
