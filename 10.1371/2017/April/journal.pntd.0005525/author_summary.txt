Mosquitoes ingest large amounts of blood, a rich and abundant source of energy to sustain egg production. Blood digestion offers challenges to the insect, like managing high concentrations of heme and iron, pro-oxidant and potentially toxic molecules derived from hemoglobin. Mosquitoes and other blood-feeding arthropods have evolved adaptations to overcome this problem, such as the activation of catalase, an antioxidant enzyme that protect tissues against toxic free radicals. Mosquitoes act as important vectors of human diseases because during a blood meal they might also ingest microorganism circulating in our blood, such as dengue and zika virus. The adaptive antioxidant program that protects mosquito tissues against the oxidative challenge imposed by a blood meal might also influences the ability of virus to establish infection and disseminate from the midgut to the salivary glands. We show here that catalase differentially influences the number of infected midguts after mosquitoes were challenged with blood contaminated with virus, being beneficial to Dengue-4 but neutral do Zika, suggesting that redox metabolism may have distinct roles on mosquito vector competence towards different arbovirus.
