Weekly iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation combined with regular deworming for women of child bearing age is effective in the prevention of iron deficiency and anaemia. Following a baseline survey, a weekly IFA and regular deworming project was implemented in Yen Bai province, Vietnam in 2006, and after 12 months expanded to the entire province. Haematological parameters, soil transmitted helminth (STH) burden and adherence to the program were monitored periodically until 2012. We found anaemia prevalence fell from 37.8% to 14.3% during the six-year period, and haemoglobin levels increased from 122 g/L to 135g/L. STH infections were essentially eliminated as a public health risk. Seventy-two percent of participants continued to take at least 75% of the weekly supplements, and 85.0% took the most recent deworming treatment. These results show that prevention of anaemia in women of child-bearing age with weekly IFA and regular deworming is feasible and effective over a prolonged period. However, long-term sustainability may be a major challenge in some settings in the absence of ongoing external support.
