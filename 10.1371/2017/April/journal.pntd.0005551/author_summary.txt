Schistosomiasis in pregnant women is associated with prematurity, low birth weight and stillbirth of the fetus. Schistosome eggs may be trapped in the placental tissue and, thus, contribute to fetal harm. As the placenta is a large organ, current microscopic histopathological examinations commonly lack sensitivity. The yield of schistosome eggs can be increased by the use of tissue maceration. However, the applied maceration procedures are labor intensive, time-consuming and cumbersome. To develop an improved maceration technique in terms of sensitivity, safety and required skills which enable its wider use in endemic areas we examined the effect of different potassium hydroxide (KOH) concentrations and different tissue fixatives with respect to maceration success and egg morphology. Placenta maceration using 4% KOH at 37Â°C for 24 h was the most effective method: placental tissue was completely digested, egg morphology was well preserved and alkaline concentration was the lowest. This improved technique may contribute to clarify the role of placental involvement in pregnant women with schistosomiasis.
