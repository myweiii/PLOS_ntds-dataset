Melioidosis is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and sepsis in Asia. The causative agent, Burkholderia pseudomallei, is listed as a potential bioterror weapon. The intestinal microbiota has been suggested to be a modulator of innate immune defenses against bacterial infections. Here we investigated in mice whether the intestinal microbiota affects the clinical course of melioidosis and vice versa. The composition of the gut microbiota changed strongly during melioidosis. Mice with a disrupted gut microbiota showed increased bacterial dissemination when compared with controls following intranasal infection with B. pseudomallei, indicating that the intestinal microbiota acts as a protective factor in host defense against melioidosis. Macrophages in microbiota-disrupted mice showed a diminished capacity to phagocytose B. pseudomallei. Further research is needed to explore whether this knowledge could be used to the advantage of patients.
