Dengue virus is rarely identified in respiratory specimens. We retrospectively identified four patients with dengue fever who had the virus isolated from their nose or throat. All the patients had respiratory signs or symptoms. Half had family members who also had respiratory symptoms. Further studies are needed to evaluate the possibility of respiratory transmission of this virus.
