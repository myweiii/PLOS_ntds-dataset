Plasmodium vivax is the second most prevalent Plasmodium species amongst the five that can infect humans and cause malaria. The control and elimination of P. vivax is complicated by its specific biology, such as hard-to-detect low densities of blood-circulating parasites in infected individuals, the existence of persistent liver forms causing relapse, or the early appearance of sexual stages of the parasite during the course of an infection, which facilitates its transmission. These difficulties are reinforced by the fact that most antimalarial tools have been developed primarily for P. falciparum, the most prevalent malaria species, and are not always as effective for P. vivax. Current tools for the diagnosis of P. vivax are of limited effectiveness. Rapid diagnostic tests exist but show, in average, lower performance than similar test for P. falciparum. P. vivax diagnosis often relies on light microscopy which is challenging to maintain at a high quality and not sensitive enough to detect a large fraction of all infections. Recognizing that better diagnostic tools for P. vivax are needed, we report in this study the development of new target product profiles to define the specific characteristics of such tests. The establishment of these consensus-based documents is an important first step to guide research and development efforts toward better diagnostic solutions for P. vivax malaria and to accelerate the elimination of this species alongside P. falciparum.
