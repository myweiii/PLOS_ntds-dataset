Northern Uganda is an epidemiologically important region affected by human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) because it harbors both forms of the HAT disease (T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense). The geographic location of this region creates the risk that these distinct foci could merge, which would complicate diagnosis and treatment, and may result in recombination between the two parasite strains with as yet unknown consequences. Both strains require a tsetse fly vector for transmission, and in Uganda, G. f. fuscipes is the major vector of HAT. Controlling the vector remains one of the most effective strategies for controlling trypanosome parasites. However, vector control efforts may not be sustainable in terms of long term reduction in G. f. fuscipes populations due to population rebounds. Population genetics data can allow us to determine the likely source of population rebounds and to establish a more robust control strategy. In this study, we build on a previous broad spatial survey of G. f. fuscipes genetic structure in Uganda by adding more than 30 novel sampling sites that are strategically spaced across a region of northern Uganda that, for historical and political reasons, was severely understudied and faces particularly high disease risk. We identify natural population breaks, migration corridors and a hybrid zone with evidence of free interbreeding of G. f. fuscipes across the geographic region that spans the two HAT disease foci. We also find evidence of low effective population sizes and population bottlenecks in some areas that have been subjects of past control but remain regions of high tsetse density, which stresses the risk of population rebounds if monitoring is not explicitly incorporated into the control strategy. We use these results to make suggestions that will enhance the design and implementation of control activities in northern Uganda.
