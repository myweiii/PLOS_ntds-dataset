Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, is a parasite transmitted between humans and pigs. The disease is most common in developing countries where access to sanitation is limited and domestic pigs are allowed to roam freely. Humans infected with the intestinal tapeworm release T. solium eggs into the environment when they defecate outside, and pigs become infected with the larval stage of the disease, cysticercosis, upon consuming these eggs in human feces. Prior work using serologic testing of pigs has shown that proximity to human tapeworm carriers is a possible risk factor for porcine cysticercosis. Our study investigated if proximity to human tapeworm carriers was associated with established cyst infection in pigs, and if proximity to tapeworm carriers also increased the degree of cyst infection in pigs (i.e., the number of T. solium cysts a pig was infected with). The results confirmed that human tapeworm carriers and infected pigs are geographically correlated, but did not uncover a stronger relationship for heavily infected pigs. It is important to continue to investigate this spatial relationship as some control strategies rely on the assumption that human tapeworm carriers will be found in close proximity to heavily infected pigs. Future control strategies would benefit from a precise knowledge of the degree of pig infection that best predicts for nearby tapeworm carriers.
