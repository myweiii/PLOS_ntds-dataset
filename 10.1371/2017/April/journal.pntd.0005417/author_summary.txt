Among the species of Schistosoma that infect humans Schistosoma mansoni is one of the most common causes of illness. In the areas where schistosomiasis mansoni is endemic, around 10% of infected individuals develop hepatosplenic schistosomiasis (HSS) with portal hypertension. Portal hypertension may promotes an imbalance in the hepatic production of vasoactive substances, which may act on the lungs promoting the formation of arteriovenous fistulas and pulmonary vascular dilation, a condition that is called a pulmonary shunt. When the pulmonary shunt is of higher grades, small thrombus or septic emboli that would normally be filtered through the pulmonary capillaries reach the left heart and the systemic circulation, which can lead to neurological complications. We found pulmonary shunts in patients with HSS and esophageal varices and we also found that patients with higher grades of pulmonary shunts presented with a significantly higher frequency of advanced periportal fibrosis and an enlarged splenic vein diameter. No neurological complications were observed. Our findings suggest that pulmonary shunts may be present in patients with HSS and esophageal varices. The abdominal ultrasound findings compatible with advanced HSS could be used as screening to investigate pulmonary shunt.
