Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic disease that causes chronic, often ulcerated, skin lesions. Treatment require administration of systemic and poorly tolerated drugs, of which, the most commonly used is meglumine antimoniate (MA) injections during 20 days. Although children and adults might have different responses to these drugs, Colombian treatment guidelines recommends meglumine antimoniate for all age groups. In this study, we explored the factors that influence the therapeutic response in children and adults with CL treated with MA and miltefosine. We included 230 children and adults in the analysis, and we found that young age (≤8 years old), presence of regional lymphadenopathy, disease duration ≤1 month, poor adherence to treatment (<90%) were associated with increased odds of treatment failure. Additionally, being treated with MA was a risk factor for therapeutic failure, especially for children. A better nutritional status (higher Z-score of height/age) was a protector factor in pediatric patients. These results highlight the urgent need to reconsider MA as first line treatment in children in Colombia and to evaluate better treatment options for this population.
