Bacterial diarrhea due to Shigella infection is a common problem in developing countries including Bangladesh. It is one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity particularly in children under five years of age. Encephalopathy, defined by altered mental status, is a life threatening presentation in children having shigellosis. The most common presentations of Shigella encephalopathy are seizure, altered consciousness and coma. If the treatment is delayed, deaths in children having Shigella encephalopathy are very high. However, we do not have sufficient knowledge about the underlying factors that contribute to encephalopathy, particularly the laboratory characteristics of such children. Thus, we wanted to know the risk factors and outcome of children with Shigella encephalopathy. Among a total of 139 Bangladeshi under five children with shigellosis enrolled for 36 months, those who had Shigella encephalopathy were independently associated with dehydrating diarrhea, sepsis, and hyponatremia and had higher case-fatality-rate compared to those without Shigella encephalopathy.
