In sub-Saharan Africa, invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infections with serovars Enteritidis (SE) and Typhimurium (STm) are widespread in children, where up to 30% of cases are fatal. There are several licensed typhoid vaccines but no NTS vaccines. We previously reported that conjugates of SE lipopolysaccharide-derived core and O-polysaccharide (COPS) and the homologous serovar flagellin protein were effective vaccines against fatal infection in mice with a Malian SE invasive clinical isolate. We document herein the development of a promising STm vaccine candidate consisting of STm COPS conjugated to STm phase 1 flagellin (FliC). STm-COPS:FliC glycoconjugates induced robust immune responses and protected mice against fatal challenge with a Malian STm blood isolate. We additionally found that while COPS O-acetyl groups were strongly immunogenic, antibodies against non-O-acetyl polysaccharide backbone epitopes could also mediate bactericidal activity. Computational modeling further indicated that STm COPS assumes a single dominant conformation in which the O-acetyl groups are highly solvent exposed and thus available targets for the immune system. These results pave the way toward clinical studies of a bivalent NTS vaccine formulation.
