Involvement of the central nervous system is an important manifestation of syphilis which may be more common in patients co-infected with HIV. As most cases of syphilis and HIV are seen in Africa it might be anticipated that neurosyphilis was common there. We reviewed all published material on neurosyphilis in Africa since 1990. There were few well designed studies of neurosyphilis. A small number of studies suggested that syphilis remains a cause of meningitis in Africa. Our data suggest that neuosyphilis remains an important disease in Africa but better prospective studies are needed to understand its epidemiology.
