Leptospirosis is an emerging environmental infectious disease caused by corkscrew shaped bacteria called Leptospira. Humans usually get infected during recreational or work-related outdoor activities through contact with urine excreted by animal reservoirs. As a zoonotic disease, leptospirosis is a good example of the One Health concept for it links humans, animals and ecosystems in a web of pathogen maintenance and transmission. This zoonosis is highly prevalent in the tropics and especially in tropical islands. Seychelles archipelago has been reported as the country with highest human incidence worldwide, although figures are based on dated studies and/or poorly specific tests. The presented investigation aimed at providing an updated information on human leptospirosis burden in Seychelles and exploring the transmission chains in their environmental aspects. Presented data confirms that the disease still heavily impacts the country. Genotyping of pathogenic Leptospira in human acute cases reveals that three distinct Sequence Types (STs) are involved in the disease. However, rats typically considered as the main reservoir in Seychelles, harbor only one of these STs, found only in a minority of human cases. Hence, it appears that rats are likely not the main reservoir of leptospirosis in Seychelles, which has important consequences in terms of preventive measures to be implemented for a better control of human leptospirosis.
