Salmonella Typhimurium sequence type (ST) 19 causes self-limiting gastroenteritis throughout the world. In recent years, a new ST of Salmonella Typhimurium, ST313, has been circulating in sub-Saharan Africa and causes fever in infants and immunocompromised individuals in the absence of gastroenteritis. The differences in pathogenesis between Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 and ST19 is not clearly understood in animal models. In our current study, we examined possible differences between ST19 and ST313 strains in different animal models. We found that ST313 strains could replicate in the blood of mice to higher levels than ST19 strains. Furthermore, when rhesus macaques were orally infected with Salmonella Typhimurium ST19 or ST313, we observed increased diarrhea, inflammation and higher bacterial burden in ST19-infected monkeys compared to ST313-infected monkeys. Our data supports the clinical evidence which suggests that Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 do not cause gastroenteritis and instead are more invasive than ST19 strains.
