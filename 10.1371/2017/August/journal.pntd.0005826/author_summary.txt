The human microbiome comprises bacteria (plus viruses, fungi and archeae) inhabiting different sites of the body. They do not specifically cause diseases, but their presence, absence or population influence body functions. We therefore examined such organisms found along the urinary tract, in persons living in a rural community in Nigeria who considered themselves healthy, were infected with the parasite Schistosoma haematobium or had developed bladder complications along with the parasite infection. We found that these groups shared a large portion of the microbiome, but there were microbial species unique to infected persons and those with bladder complication. Some of these were capable of inducing inflammation and could offer less protection to the host. We also predicted pathways that are affected by the difference in the microbiome.
