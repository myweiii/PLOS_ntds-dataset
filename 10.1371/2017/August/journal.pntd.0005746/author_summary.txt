Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a tick-borne viral disease and first reported in the rural areas of China. Pathogenesis of the disease has not been well described yet. Recent studies indicated that SFTSV replicated in endothelial cells. So, we performed a case-control study to explore whether endothelial activation/dysfunction occurred in SFTSV infection and to identify biomarkers reflecting endothelial dysfunction. We found that the occurrence of endothelial activation/dysfunction in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome and the serum levels of ICAM-1 and SAA-1 might be used to predict adverse outcome.
