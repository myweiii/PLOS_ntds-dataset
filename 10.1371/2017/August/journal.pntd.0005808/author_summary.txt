Skin disorders are very common in all geographical locations and especially so in low and middle income countries. In these settings many of the commonest skin disorders are communicable.
Human ectoparasites such as lice and scabies mites live on the skin and Tunga penetrans fleas enter the skin to shed their eggs and complete their lifecycle. All of these ectoparasites cause significant morbidity particularly in poorer communities.
We have shown that the infestations of scabies and tungiasis were the commonest skin disorders in the Ethiopian schoolchildren examined in this study. These conditions are associated with a significant impact on the quality of life of these children as measured by the Childrenâ€™s Dermatology Life Quality Index.
Footwear protects individuals from many conditions both infectious and non-infectious however in this cohort footwear was associated with maceration of the skin and this requires further investigation.
