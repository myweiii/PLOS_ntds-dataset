Chagas disease, a potentially deadly cardiac disease of humans, canines and other mammals is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The parasite is primarily transmitted to dogs by ingestion of infected triatomine ‘kissing bug’ vectors or through contact with the insect’s feces. Previous studies concluded that stray and shelter dogs are at high risk of infection in the southern U.S. We proposed that high-value U.S. government working dogs along the Texas-Mexico border may also be at high risk because of their activities in regions with established, infected vector populations. We sampled 528 working dogs along the Texas-Mexico border, and found that 7.4–18.9% of dogs were positive for T. cruzi antibodies and a small proportion (0.6%) also had parasite circulating in the blood. We collected two species of kissing bugs from the canine environments and used molecular approaches to determine that 45% were positive for T. cruzi and the majority had recently fed on canines. We highlight the need for better diagnostic tools for canine Chagas disease research and diagnosis. The widespread burden of T. cruzi infection in the government working dogs could be associated with far-reaching consequences for both animal and human well-being.
