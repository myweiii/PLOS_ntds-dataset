Members of the Mycobacteriaceae family, which are known to adapt to different environmental niches, comprise bacterial species with varied genome sizes. They are unique in their cell-wall composition, which is remarkably thick and lipid-rich as compared to other bacteria. We performed a comparative analysis at the proteome level for ten mycobacterial species that differ in their pathogenicity, genome size and environmental niches. A total of 1080 orthologous clusters with representation from all ten species were obtained, and these were further examined for their domain annotations, domain architecture similarities and enriched GO terms. These core orthologous clusters are enriched in various biosynthetic pathways. The proteins that are specific to each of the ten species were also investigated for their GO functions. The M. leprae genome has a large number of pseudogenes and we searched for their functional orthologs in other mycobacterial species in order to understand the functions that are lost from the M. leprae genome. The proteins present exclusively in M. leprae genome were studied in more detail, in order to predict putative drug targets and diagnostic markers. These findings, which have implications in understanding evolution of mycobacterial genomes, identify species-specific proteins that have potential for use in developing new diagnostic tools and therapeutics.
