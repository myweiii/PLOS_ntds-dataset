Buruli ulcer is a chronic skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, and the disease is characterized by the painless nature of its lesion. Similar to leprosy, loss of pain often hinders the patients from taking proper medical care, resulting in gross deformities. A toxic lipid mycolactone produced from Mycobacterium ulcerans was thought to block the sensory system of the lesion, either by direct cellular damage (cytotoxicity) to the regional nerve tissue, or by a more sophisticated, non-toxic paralyzing mechanism. In the peripheral nerve, Schwann cells nourish axons and accelerate nerve conduction. In this study, we have compared the cytotoxic potential of mycolactone on cultured Schwann cells and that on fibroblasts, and found that mycolactone A/B induced much higher cell death and apoptosis in Schwann cell line SW10 than in fibroblast line L929. These results support the cytotoxic theory and suggest that mycolactone is a key substance in the production of nerve damage of Buruli ulcer.
