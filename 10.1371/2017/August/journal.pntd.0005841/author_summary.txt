Early predictive factors for a favorable development of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) are important to improve management due to the high mortality of this infection at 5 years. The purpose of this study was to search for early factors that could predict at the first year, the favorable or unfavorable evolution of NTM-PD. This multicenter and retrospective study shows the importance of the duration of use of certain antibiotics (e.g. ethambutol and macrolides) in combination with other drugs in the one-year improvement of patients with NTM-PD. It also confirms the favorable prognosis at one year of NTM-PD patients with HIV-positive status. Identifying predictors of improvement at one year of NTM-PD is expected to optimize prognosis of the disease in its early stages.
