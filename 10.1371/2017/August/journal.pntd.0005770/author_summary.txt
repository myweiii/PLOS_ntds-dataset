Bolivia has the highest prevalence of Chagas disease (CD) in the world (6.1%), with more than 607,186 people with Trypanosoma cruzi infection. In Bolivia, the management of CD has been declared a national priority. In 2009, the Chagas National Program (ChNP) had neither a protocol nor a clear directive for diagnosis and treatment of adults. The Chagas Platform has been built as a model for comprehensive care of adults with CD. From 2010 to 2015, a total of 26,227 patients were attended by the Platform, 69% (18,316) were diagnosed with T. cruzi, 8,567 initiated anti-parasitic treatment, more than 1,616 health professionals were trained. More than ten research projects were developed. The project has also produced evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, and brings about changes in policy that will increase access to comprehensive care among adults with CD. The ChNP is now studying the Platformâ€™s health care model to adapt and implement it nationwide. It is an experience of collaboration and knowledge transfer between endemic and non-endemic countries.
