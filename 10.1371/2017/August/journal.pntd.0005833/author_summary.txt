Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) known as sleeping sickness is a lethal neglected disease in West and Central Africa, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense that is transmitted by tsetse flies Glossina palpalis gambiensis. The disease has long been considered to be invariably fatal, but field studies show that T. b. gambiense infection leads to a wide diversity of clinical outcomes. An acute form progressing rapidly to second stage; spontaneous self-cure and individuals able to control parasitaemia at very low levels (latent infections). In the present study, we test for associations between candidate gene polymorphisms and different HAT phenotypes (HAT confirmed cases, latent infections) and endemic controls, in order to identify relationships between the clinical diversity and host genetic determinants. Our results, based on clinical, serological and parasitological observations, combined with genotypes and association analysis form the most complete study of host genetic determinants and clinical diversity of HAT in Guinea to date. We show that host genes are involved in modulating responses in Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infected individuals. A new association was found between IL6 rs1818879 and a reduced risk of progressing from latent infection to active HAT. These results constitute an important stage toward the identification of the natural human mechanisms involved in T. b. gambiense infection regulation.
