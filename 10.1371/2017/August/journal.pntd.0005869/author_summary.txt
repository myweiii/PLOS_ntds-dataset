Shortly following the introduction of Zika virus (ZIKV), a type of flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes, into Brazil in early 2015, the Brazil Ministry of Health began receiving increased reports of a paralyzing condition known as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS). The areas with the greatest number of GBS cases appeared to correlate geographically and temporally with the areas reporting the highest rate of ZIKV infections. This association had been previously observed during a ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia, however, this had not been systematically examined in a case-control investigation for the ZIKV outbreak in South America. In this investigation, the authors found that the occurrence of GBS in the affected population was nearly four times higher than would be expected, and the risk for GBS was particularly elevated among older adults. GBS was associated with ZIKV-like symptoms and with a combination of ZIKV-like symptoms plus laboratory evidence of a recent flavivirus infection. Taken together, these findings provide strong support for and greater understanding of the link between ZIKV and GBS.
