Schistosomiasis (Bilharzia) is a serious public health problem caused by a parasite of genus Schistosoma. There is an increasing concern about development of parasite resistance to the only drug available for treatment, praziquantel (PZQ). Miltefosine, a repurposed anti-cancer drug for treatment of Leishmania infection, was shown to have activity against Schistosoma in animal models at all the parasite’s life cycle stages. In this work, we examined the potential that miltefosine could act to expose parasite surface antigens that are normally hidden during natural infection as a way to avoid lethal effects of host immunity. We used two immunobinding techniques, immunofluorescence and western immunoblotting, and a protein identification technique, namely mass spectrometry, to identify proteins exposed on the worm surface following incubation with miltefosine. Four S. mansoni proteins were shown to be exposed by miltefosine treatment: fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (SmFBPA), Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase and malate dehydrogenase. Antibodies specific for these antigens recognised and bound to the surface of early-stage schistosome larvae and antibodies specific for SmFBPA induced clumping of the larvae, suggesting a potential role in early parasite killing and protection against infection. These antibodies may be utilised to increase miltefosine’s anti-parasite efficacy and may be involved in resistance to re-infection.
