Snakebite envenoming is a neglected public health problem in many developing countries and antivenom administration constitutes the mainstay in the treatment of such envenomings. Therapeutic antivenoms contain animal-derived antibodies against venom toxins and are produced by immunizing animals with the venom from one or several snake species from a defined geographical area. Defining the geographic boundaries of the efficiency of an antivenom therefore has implications for its rational and efficient use. In Central and South America most accidents are caused by pitvipers of the genus Bothrops, Crotalus and Lachesis. There are four Lachesis species distributed in a variety of habitats ranging from the Caribbean coast of Central America to the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil. Lachesis species cause severe envenomings in humans due to the toxicity of their venoms and also to the large amount of venom they inject into their victims. In this work we investigate the capability of several antivenoms to neutralize the toxic activities of a panel of Lachesis venoms. The results demonstrate that antivenoms raised by immunizing horses with the venoms of different Lachesis species are effective at neutralizing congeneric venoms not used in the immunization, indicating that they could be used equivalently for the clinical treatment of any lachesic envenoming.
