Since it was described in 1935, more than 2800 cases of the disease have reportedly been caused by A. cantonensis worldwide, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite a relevant body of research on pathology, diagnosis and treatment, little is known about the phylogeography of A. cantonensis. Since southern China is one of the endemic regions, we performed this experiment to reveal the distribution pattern of A. cantonensis in southern China based on mitochondrial Cytb data. Our results revealed a unique pattern probably shaped by the biological features of its hosts and geographical barriers, simultaneously reflecting a low gene flow among populations. Nevertheless, the connective consanguinity between some locations (Taiwan and Southeast Asia) provides new evidence of the impact on its dispersal as influenced by human activities, indicating the emerging need of an effective strategy to control this helminth. In addition to the corresponding investigation on its hosts, more attention to the situation in southwest China and Southeast Asia is suggested to facilitate the understanding of the phylogeography of A. cantonensis.
