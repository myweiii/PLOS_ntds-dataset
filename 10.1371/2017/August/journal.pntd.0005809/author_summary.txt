Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a virus closely related to Variola virus, the cause of smallpox, and it causes a similar, though less severe, disease in humans in Central and West Africa. This disease is particularly dangerous for children and people with compromised immune systems and the mortality rate is estimated to be about 10% in the more pathogenic Central African strains. Unlike Variola virus, MPXV is primarily transmitted to humans from animals, but it is not known which species commonly carry and spread this virus. Rope squirrels in the genus Funisciurus have previously been linked to the virus in Central Africa. In this study, rope squirrels were experimentally infected with MPXV and subsequently monitored for signs of disease, as well as the amount of virus they shed in their bodily fluids. The results of this study showed that rope squirrels became moderately ill but not all died. They shed large amounts of virus in oral, nasal, rectal, and ocular secretions. This information helps public health doctors and epidemiologists understand the potential risks of contacting rope squirrels for local populations in Africa and will help disease ecologists understand how MPXV is maintained and transmitted between animals and to humans.
