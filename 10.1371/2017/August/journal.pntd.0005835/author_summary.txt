Determination of association between mosquito larval abundance and physicochemical factors in aquatic habitats in Mazandaran Province was the purpose of this study. In 30 villages of 16 counties in the province, Culex pipiens, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and An. maculipennis s.l. were the most abundant species discovered in larval habitats. The pair of species An. maculipennis s.l/An. pseudopictus has the highest interspecific association in the area. Culex pipiens showed the greatest compatibility compared with other species with a range of densities from the lowest to the highest in different habitats containing varying levels of physicochemical factors. Measuring physicochemical factors of water in larval habitats indicated that values of chloride, electrical conductivity, alkalinity and total hardness were significantly associated with the larval abundance in different larval habitats. The electrical conductivity, alkalinity, total hardness and chloride had significant positive correlation with the density of Cx. pipiens, whereas no negative correlation was obtained between larval density and physicochemical factors. These differences in preferences and association with varying levels of physicochemical factors can have vector-borne diseases control implications, because habitat changes through the manipulation of these factors to the detriment of vector species can ultimately lead to reduced abundance of vector species. The data may also be useful to predict changes in the densities of mosquito larvae or their transition should natural or artificial environmental modifications lead to alteration in the physicochemical factors.
