Schistosoma sp. are parasitic worms that infect at least 218 million people worldwide. Over 90% of these individuals live in Africa, where HIV infection is also endemic. Schistosome worms lay eggs that damage the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, causing extensive morbidity and mortality. Patients who have HIV and Schistosoma mansoni co-infections are at risk for damage to the liver due to both the effects of the schistosome parasite and the side-effects of antiretroviral therapy. However, little is known about the additional liver effects of schistosome infection in patients already taking antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, we conducted a study in northwest Tanzania, where our prior work has shown that approximately one-third of HIV-infected patients also have schistosome infections, to investigate the effect of co-infection with Schistosoma mansoni on liver damage in patients taking antiretroviral therapy. We studied 305 HIV-infected outpatients on medium and long-term antiretroviral therapy and determined both liver damage and S.mansoni infection in those patients. We found that among patients on antiretroviral therapy, those with HIV-schistosome co-infection were 3 times more likely to have liver damage than those with HIV infection alone. Our work shows the importance of screening and treating for Schistosoma mansoni to decrease the risk of liver damage in patients infected with HIV.
