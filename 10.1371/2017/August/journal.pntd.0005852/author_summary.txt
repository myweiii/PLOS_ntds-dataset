Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, presents a variable clinical course, varying from asymptomatic to serious debilitating pathologies with cardiac, digestive or cardio-digestive impairment. It has been suggested that parasite differential tissue tropism is responsible for the development of the distinct clinical forms. Differences in parasite tissue tropism have been shown previously, using mixed infections in mice with two distinct T. cruzi populations, Col1.7G2 (T. cruzi I) and JG (T. cruzi II). In these infections hearts were preferentially colonized by JG. Increased JG adaptation to cardiac muscle was later confirmed in infection studies using isolated cardiomyocytes, where it was shown that selection was dependent on parasite intracellular development. However the mechanisms that determined this differential parasite intracellular growth was not described. Here we investigated whether host cell response upon T. cruzi infection was able to modulate parasite multiplication rate inside cells. We showed that, upon infection, cardiomyocytes increase the production of oxidative species, especially in cultures infected with JG and inhibition of oxidative stress severely interfered with the intracellular multiplication rate of JG. Data obtained suggests that JG and Col1.7G2 may sense extracellular oxidants in a distinct manner, which would enable JG to develop better inside cardiomyocytes.
