Trypanosomiasis, spread by tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), is a disease that is fatal for both humans and livestock if left untreated, and is a serious threat to public health in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. In order to understand the dynamics of the disease it is important also to understand tsetse population dynamics. Tsetse fly mortality estimates are central to this understanding, but are difficult to acquire from wild populations. Previous methods for estimating mortality from age-distribution data assume a stable age structure and age-invariant mortality and capture probability. Based on prior fieldwork, none of these assumptions appears justified. Building on previous mortality estimation techniques, and incorporating what is known about tsetse population dynamics, we develop simulation techniques to estimate mortality for tsetse populations where the age distribution is not necessarily stable. We fit our models to age-distribution data produced in 1991 and 1992 at Rekomitjie Research Station in the Zambezi Valley in Zimbabwe. Our final model produces mortality estimates consistent with those of mark-recapture studies performed in other settings. We find that mortality increases with temperature, a result consistent with field and laboratory findings, and that the temperature effects are much more severe for pupae and newly emerged adults than for mature adults. Our dynamical modelling approach could be used for mortality estimation for any population where substantial age distribution data are available: specifically, it could be used to answer substantive questions about tsetse flies in other settings.
