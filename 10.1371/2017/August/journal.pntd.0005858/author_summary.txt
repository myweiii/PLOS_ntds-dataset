Despite the growing problem of dengue (DEN) and yellow fever (YF) evidenced from recent outbreaks in East Africa, risk assessment for their transmission and establishment through surveys of populations of the Aedes mosquito vectors, remain scarce. By estimating standard indices for the potential vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes bromeliae we partly could deduce the risk of transmission of these diseases in three major cities of Kenya, namely Kilifi (DEN-prone) and Kisumu and Nairobi (without any DEN outbreak reports). When compared to established threshold risk levels by WHO and PAHO, our findings suggest low-to-medium risk of urban YF, and high risk of DEN transmission for Kilifi and Kisumu but not Nairobi (low risk level for YF and low-to-medium risk for DEN). The observed seasonal risk patterns, higher Aedes infestation outdoors than indoors and productive container types (jerricans, drums, discarded containers and tyres), provide insights into the disease epidemiology and are valuable for targeted vector control, respectively.
