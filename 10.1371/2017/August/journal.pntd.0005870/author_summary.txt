Leptospirosis is an emerging neglected zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution that affects nearly all vertebrates and causes infection in ~1 million people on a yearly basis. Effective cross-protective vaccines are not available and antibiotic treatment is only effective if used early in the course of infection. In this study we describe how repeated oral treatment of mice with a commonly used probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum, did not completely prevent colonization of the kidney by Leptospira interrogans but it did reduce signs and symptoms of leptospirosis. We also analyzed a number of immune cell types in spleen, lymph nodes and kidney after treatment and found that complex responses orchestrate the deployment of phagocytes to the kidney in infected mice. Our results suggest that pre-treatment with L. plantarum modulates systemic immune responses in a beneficial way in a mammalian host later exposed to L. interrogans infection.
