Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Although the number of reported cases has declined in recent years, the disease still represents a challenge. During the second, meningoencephalitic, stage of the disease trypanosomes invade the brain. Consequently the infection can only be cured with toxic drugs which enter the brain, and is fatal if left untreated. Identifying the onset of this stage is therefore of crucial importance for therapeutic decisions. Using experimental infection in rats, we investigated the expression of interferon-Î³ and interferon-dependent chemokine genes involved in the disease progression. In parallel, we determined when the characteristic alterations of the sleep/wake cycle emerge in relation to the onset of the encephalitic stage, which was assessed histologically by the detection of parasites in the brain tissue. The results indicate that detection of perturbation of the sleep/wake cycle, especially the intrusion of sleep episodes into wakefulness, followed by an increase in CXCL10 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, could provide combined functional and humoral biomarkers of the early encephalitic stage of African trypanosomiasis.
