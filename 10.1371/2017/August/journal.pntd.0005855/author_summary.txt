Elimination of snail intermediate host of schistosomiasis has been widely advocated as an arm of integrated control for schistosomiasis. This becomes important as reports now abound on development of praziquantel resistance in schistosomes. Nanotechnology has been applied in control of tropical diseases including schistosomiasis. The few available nanomedicines were targeted against the Schistosoma worms without research efforts on the use of the same technology against the molluscan host of the parasite. This study seeks to assess the molluscicidal potential of CurNisNp on Biomphalaria pfeifferi; a snail intermediate host of Schistosoma mansoni. The formulation was tested on the different developmental stages of the snail. The formulation showed decreasing molluscicidal activity with increase in age of the snail. Impairment of the egg laying capacity of the adult snails was related to nanoparticle concentration. The egg was the most resistant stage. It is evident from the study that the formulated nanoparticle had molluscicidal properties and to further harness this potential, optimisation of the formulation to give a narrow range monodispersed polydispersity index for better drug distribution is recommended.
