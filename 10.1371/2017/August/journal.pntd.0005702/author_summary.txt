B. pseudomallei is a bacterium that causes melioidosis, a disease endemic in Southeastern Asia and Northern Australia. It is estimated that melioidosis leads to 89,000 deaths worldwide each year. Nevertheless, melioidosis continues to remain a neglected tropical disease that is not even on the list of neglected tropical diseases of the World Health Organization. Furthermore, the disease has a high mortality and recurrence rate, which can be up to 40% and 13%, respectively. It has also been well documented that B. pseudomallei causes latent/persistent infections for a prolonged period without showing apparent symptoms in the infected individual. The mechanisms that are responsible for bacterial persistence in the host remain unclear. Our results demonstrated that B. pseudomallei were able to upregulate PD-1 expression on B cells, NK cells, and/or monocytes during persistent diseases, which likely diminish optimal host immunity. The weakened host immunity in turns facilitates persistence of the bacterium. Interestingly, the SCV had a higher PD-1 expression on distinct immune cells compared to the WT, which might explain its frequent association with persistent infections. Immunotherapies by targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could serve as a better treatment than the conventional antibiotic regimens, which cause a high rate of recurrence in melioidosis patients.
