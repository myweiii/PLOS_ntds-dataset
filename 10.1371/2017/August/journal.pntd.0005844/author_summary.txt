Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is a human vector-borne disease caused by the parasite Leishmania major and is well spread in rural areas where human resources in public health and infrastructure are limited. The cycle of transmission of the disease is complex because of the impact of climate change. In this study we evaluated the impact of bioclimatic factors on the transmission of the disease in three districts of Sidi Bouzid, central Tunisia. We found that the occurrence of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is mainly related to average temperature with 4 months lags, rodents' density lagged 2 months, relative humidity with 4 months lags and cumulative rainfall lagged 1 month. We also confirmed that our best-fit model predict well the occurrence of the disease.
