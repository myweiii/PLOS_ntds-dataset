Liver fibroproliferative diseases drive a considerable fraction of the overall human mortality. This is closely linked to the absence of efficient control measures against such diseases. Schistosomiasis, a chronic disease that affects humans, preferentially causes liver fibrosis and is responsible for devastating economic losses in developing nations where the disease is still endemic. Using reverse genetics, loss-of-function mouse models have helped uncover a protective role for Interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4Rα) in the host survival to experimental schistosomiasis. However, given the contributing role for this receptor in the etiology of some models of tissue fibrosis, its role during chronic schistosomiasis where the highly fibrotic liver of the infected individuals mediate the morbidity had not been properly addressed hitherto. Taking advantage of a third generation mouse model of inducible loss of a gene, we found a debilitating role for IL-4 receptor during chronic schistosomiasis as signaling via this receptor supported both liver inflammation and fibrosis. These findings demonstrate that although the host requires IL-4Rα to survive the acute phase of schistosomiasis, the more clinically relevant morbid phase of the disease is driven by the excessive utilization of this receptor. A therapeutic potential of blocking IL-4Rα to ameliorate liver fibroproliferative disease is therefore suggested.
