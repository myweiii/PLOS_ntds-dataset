Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus whose principal vectors are the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Though long endemic to Asia and Africa, detection of CHIKV has recently been reported throughout the Western Hemisphere, including much of South America and the Caribbean. In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the epidemiology of CHIKV remains poorly characterized despite recent reports of outbreaks and novel transmission in the Arabian Peninsula. To better understand existing data describing the epidemiology of urban CHIKV in the MENA region, we conducted a systematic review of human prevalence studies and incidence studies; CHIKV detections, prevalence, and infection rates in Aedes; and reported CHIKV outbreaks, case series, and case reports from the region. A total of 29 seroprevalence studies were identified through our search, with anti-CHIKV antibodies and/or outbreaks detected in Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Sudan reported the highest number of studies (n = 11) and the highest seroprevalence among all studies. The epidemiology of urban CHIKV in other MENA countries is less well characterized, suggesting underascertainment of cases and the need for further research.
