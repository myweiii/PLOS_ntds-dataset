European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1) is one of fourteen officially recognized lyssavirus species causing rabies, a zoonosis resulting inevitably in death once clinical signs appear. EBLV-1 is responsible for most bat rabies cases detected in Europe, and spill-over infections in humans highlight its zoonotic potential. In our study, we compared eight genetically diverse EBLV-1 isolates in the mouse model using various routes of inoculation. Although EBLV-1 isolates displayed very high sequence conservation, significant differences in pathogenicity, i.e. in incubation periods and mouse survival, were observed. Furthermore, depending on the inoculation route the clinical picture as well as the virus antigen distribution within the brain varied. Thus, transfer of results obtained with single isolates to the whole lyssavirus species can be misleading, and results indicating reduced pathogenicity obtained with single EBLV-1 isolates in previous studies have to be carefully interpreted.
