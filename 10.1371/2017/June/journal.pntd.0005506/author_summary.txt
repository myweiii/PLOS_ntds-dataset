Despite three decades of effective treatment with multidrug therapy (MDT), leprosy persists as a public health problem in many regions of the world. The recent increase in relapse cases, MDT treatment failures, and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium leprae could undermine existing leprosy control measures. PCR/DNA sequencing is currently the method of choice for drug-resistance surveillance in leprosy; however, this technique is not available to most endemic communities and is not cost-effective for large sampling surveys. Therefore, there is a need for drug-susceptibility tests for M. leprae that could be applicable to large sampling studies, particularly in low-resource areas, where leprosy is endemic, resistance appears to be low, but drug resistance prevalence is likely to be underestimated. Our study demonstrated the utility of qPCR-HRM DST of qPCR-RLEP positive specimens as a reliable screening tool that improves the applicability in endemic regions and reduces cost and time for drug susceptibility screening from a variety of specimen types. To improve the overall reliability we recommend that all mutants be subjected to DNA sequencing, thereby providing valuable information to improve patient treatment outcome and to the global context of leprosy drug resistance monitoring.
