A stochastic model for the spread of R. rickettsii among the Amblyomma sculptum tick vector and the Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, amplifier host, was formulated. We found that the introduction of a single infected capybara, with at least one infected attached tick, is enough to trigger the disease in a non-endemic area. To avoid disease propagation, it is crucial to impede the emigration of capybaras from endemic areas by keeping the population in a stable state. Otherwise, to eliminate the disease from endemic areas, a reduction by more than 58% in the capybara birth rate is necessary. These results allow improving the planning of public actions to prevent Brazilian Spotted fever based on the control of capybara population and provided a basis for planning prevention programs for other neglected vector-borne diseases.
