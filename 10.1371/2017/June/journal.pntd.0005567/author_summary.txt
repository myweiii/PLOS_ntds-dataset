Lymphatic filariasis is a chronic illness that is disabling and often results in disfigurement. Affected people experience rejection, and stigma and discrimination, which can result in significant emotional consequences. Overall functioning and the quality of life of such individuals can be further affected by this exclusion and psychosocial impacts. Little or no attention is presently paid to the emotional impact of this disease in the overall management of people affected. The study, therefore, aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of depression, as well as associated socio-demographic factors, in individuals with physical disfigurement from lymphatic filariasis in Plateau State, Nigeria. Ninety-four consecutive consenting individuals with physically disfiguring lymphatic filariasis at 5 established treatment centers across Plateau State, Nigeria, were recruited and had semi-structured sociodemographic, Patient Health (PHQ-9), the depression module of Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and Rosenberg Self-esteem questionnaires administered using a 2-stage design. Twenty percent of the sample were found to be depressed, while history of mental illness, duration of the illness, being unemployed, and religion were predictive of depression. High self-esteem was negatively correlated. The study underscores the need to go beyond just the physical needs of individuals with lymphatic filariasis. Management must be holistic and attention must be focused on the emotional sequelae of lymphatic filariasis.
