Parasitic nematodes infect humans and livestock worldwide, affecting human fitness and food security. Despite decades of research, the development of vaccines against these pathogens has been largely unsuccessful. Since the initiation and maintenance of anti-nematode immune responses is paramount for the design of effective vaccines, a better understanding of the mechanisms governing such host protective immune responses is essential. The authors herein demonstrate that host signaling via interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) is not only needed for the establishment of protective type 2 immune responses during primary infection of mice with the parasitic nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, but also critical for the maintenance of such responses thereafter. The authors also demonstrate that the host resistance to re-infection with this parasitic nematode in previously infected mice is promoted by an intact IL-4Rα mediated signaling. These data suggest a novel role for IL-4Rα in the maintenance and recall of protective anti-nematode immune responses and imply a need for sustained IL-4Rα mediated signaling to achieve better vaccination efficiency against parasitic nematodes.
