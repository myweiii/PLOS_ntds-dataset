    "Introduction": "Scabies is a worldwide disease that affects millions of humans, other species of primates, and many wild and domestic mammals. It is caused by the itch mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, that burrows in the lower stratum corneum of the epidermis of the skin. Scabies mites are the source of substances that modulate certain aspects of the inflammatory innate and adaptive immune response of the host allowing it to evade detection by the host until it is able to establish a thriving population [1\u201312]. Ordinary scabies is a difficult disease to diagnose and there are no diagnostic blood tests with adequate sensitivity and specificity available to identify patients early in the course of an infection [13].\nThe goal of this project was to identify S. scabiei proteins that (1) may be candidate antigens for use in a diagnostic test or (2) may be among those used by the mite to modulate the host\u2019s protective responses.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nSerum from patients with confirmed ordinary scabies was collected under Human Subjects Protocol (HSP) #0205 as approved by the Wright State University Institutional Review Board (IRB). All patients were adults and all provided written informed consent. Negative control sera were previously provided to us without personal identifiers under protocol SC #2714 approved as EXEMPT under CFR 46.101(b)(4) by the Wright State University IRB.\n\n\nS. scabiei mite extract\nAn aqueous extract of Sarcoptes scabiei var. canis was prepared by homogenizing mites in endotoxin-free water as previously described [14]. Following two 24-hr extractions, the supernatants were collected by centrifugation, sterile-filtered (0.22 \u03bcm) into sterile vials and stored at 4\u00b0C. The protein content of this and all other samples was determined using the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard [15].\n\n\nProtein separation\nUnless otherwise noted, the materials used for protein separation and analysis were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA.\nProteins in the S. scabiei extract (40 mL containing 175 mg protein) were concentrated using preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF) as previously described [16] using a Bio-Rad Rotofor apparatus with ampholytes of pH 3\u201310 (BioLyte 3/10, 2% wt/vol final) and 5% glycerol. Focusing at 5\u00b0C for 5 hr at 12 W yielded 20 fractions with pH 1.6\u201313. Fractions 4\u201315 (pH 4\u20138 containing ~ 120 mg protein) were recombined and subjected to a second IEF separation. Fraction 14 had the highest protein concentration (2.2 mg/mL) and a pH of 5.0 and was selected for further study.\nTwo-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described [14]. An aliquot of Fraction 14 was prepared using the ReadyPrep 2-D Cleanup Kit and the resulting protein sample was extracted into ReadyPrep Rehydration/Sample Buffer. Two identical samples, each containing ~200 \u03bcg of protein, were loaded onto 11 cm ReadyStrip pH 5\u20138 IPG strips using overnight passive rehydration. Second dimension separation was carried out using Criterion TGX Any kD precast gels as before. At the conclusion of the electrophoretic separation, one gel was stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The other gel was prepared for electrophoretic transfer.\n\n\nElectrophoretic transfer and immunoblotting\nFollowing 2D separation, the proteins on the second gel were transferred to an \u201cImmun-Blot PVDF Membrane for Protein Blotting\u201d using condition as previously described [17]. PBST, composed of Dulbecco\u2019s Phosphate Buffered Saline + 1% Tween 20, was used as wash. BPBST (PBST+ 1% BSA + 1% normal goat serum) was used to block the membranes and for antibody dilutions except as noted.\nA pool of serum from patients with confirmed ordinary scabies was prepared by combining equal volumes of 5 individual serum samples [18]. The serum pool was diluted 1/60 and used to probe the blot for 2 hrs. For IgM binding, the blot was probed for 1 hr in biotinylated-Goat anti-Human IgM at 1/5000 and 1hr in streptavidin-Alkaline Phosphatase at 1/5000 (both from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Tris-buffered saline (TBS) replaced PBS in wash and diluent prior to the Alkaline Phosphatase step. The blot was developed using AP Blue Membrane Substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) yielding blue spots where IgM bound. The blot was imaged and subsequently re-probed for IgG binding using biotinylated-Goat anti-Human IgG at 1/5000 and streptavidin-Horseradish Peroxidase at 1/5000 (Southern Biotechnology Associates). IgG binding proteins were stained reddish-brown using the substrate of Young [19]. Proteins that bound both IgM and IgG appeared purplish on the finished blot.\n\n\nStained spot selection and protein identification\nBoth the stained gel and probed immunoblot were imaged and the images were overlaid with a 1,000-cell grid (25 row x 40 cells/row) as described before [14]. This allowed each stained protein spot on the gel and on the corresponding blot to be assigned a unique \u201cspot number\u201d identifier.\nNinety-seven blue-stained spots were excised from the gel using a 1-mm spot picker, collected into labeled LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) and frozen. Samples were shipped to Applied Biomics (Hayward, CA) for trypsin digestion and sequencing by mass spectrometry. Proteins were identified by MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK) search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant database (NCBInr) with taxonomy restricted to \u201cSarcoptes scabiei\u201d. This database contains the complete genome and predicted proteome for S. scabiei var. canis [20].\n\n\nRecombinant protein expression and purification\nGene sequences for selected proteins were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) with the open reading frame being codon-optimized for expression in E. coli. Additional modifications to the open reading frame were made to eliminate any internal BamHI, HindIII, and KpnI restriction sites. The termini of each gene contained in-frame 5' BamHI and 3' HindIII restriction sites for cloning into the pET-45b(+) expression vector. Expression vectors were transformed into E. coli Rosetta(DE3) competent cells (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Transformants were selected on ampicillin-containing solid media plates, and 3-mL overnight liquid cultures were generated from five separate single colonies. The overnight cultures were incubated in liquid LB media that included ampicillin. All five cultures were then combined the following morning and subcultured into 500 mL of LB media without ampicillin for 3 hrs, followed by induction of protein expression by the addition of 1 mM (final concentration) IPTG for three hours. All liquid cultures were maintained in a MaxQ 4000 orbital shaking incubator (Thermo, Waltham, MA) shaking at 250 rpm and held at 32\u00b0C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 20 min. Cell pellets were stored at -80\u00b0C until protein purification. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mL of ice cold 1x Tris Buffered Saline (25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2) containing Pierce Protease Inhibitor without EDTA (Thermo, Waltham, MA). Resuspended cells were disrupted by sonication on ice using 10 pulses of 30 sec on, 30 sec off with a 4710 series ultrasonic homogenizer (Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) set at 40% amplitude. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.4 \u03bcm syringe filter. His-tagged proteins were then purified by column purification on Pierce His Pur Cobalt chromatography columns (Thermo) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and using a final elution volume of 3 mL. Purified proteins were quantified and analyzed as follows.\n\n\nImmunoscreening of recombinant proteins\nAll recombinant proteins were subjected to an initial immunoblot screening. Aliquots of purified proteins (3\u201310 \u03bcg) were loaded onto the single prep-well of Mini-Protean TGX Any kD Gels and electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V as recommended by the manufacturer (BioRad) and as described previously [21, 22]. Separated proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes that were blocked as described above.\nTen pools of serum from patients with confirmed scabies infestations were prepared based on prior assessment [13, 18]. A pool of serum from healthy control subjects was included as a negative control. All proteins were tested with these sera. Eight proteins of interest were also screened with serum from 30 individual patients with ordinary scabies and 10 uninfested controls [13, 18].\nBlots were loaded into a mini-slot blot apparatus (Mini-Protean Multiscreen, BioRad) [21, 22] and probed for 2 hrs with the sera as described above. After removal from the slot blot apparatus, blots were sequentially developed for IgM and IgG binding as described above.\nThe purity of all individual proteins was also determined using electrophoresis on Mini-Protean TGX Any kD Gels run as above and stained with GelCode Blue.",
    "Results": "Our previous analysis revealed that most of the soluble proteins present in an aqueous extract of scabies mites had isoelectric points (pIs) in the range of pH 5\u20138 [14]. In the present analysis, we used preparative IEF to concentrate proteins with pIs in this vicinity and then used IPG strips of pH 5\u20138 for final separation.\nNinety-seven protein-containing spots were excised from the GelCode Coomassie blue stained gel and were submitted for sequence analysis (Fig 1). All 97 spots were identified as containing one or more proteins of S. scabiei var. canis (Table 1). There were a total of 50 different S. scabiei proteins identified and 34 of these had not been previously reported (Fig 1, Table 1). The proteins from an identical gel were transferred to a PVDF membrane that was probed using a pool of sera from 5 patients with confirmed ordinary scabies infections that had previously been determined to have high levels of circulating antibodies that recognized antigens in S. scabiei extracts [13, 18]. Of the 97 protein-containing spots, one bound only IgM, 32 bound only IgG and 29 bound both IgM and IgG (Fig 2, Table 1). No antibody bound to 33 of the spots.\nNumbers in black denote those identified proteins observed only on the stained gel. Numbers in red indicate identified proteins that also bound antibody (immunoblot shown in Fig 2) from the serum of patients with ordinary scabies.\nNumbers in red indicate identified proteins that bound antibody from the serum of patients with ordinary scabies.\nWe previously postulated that a diagnostic test for scabies would require identifying a set of antigens that selectively bind antibody (especially IgM) from the serum of patients suspected of being infected with scabies mites [13]. Based on the antibody-binding profiles of the proteins identified on the 2D gel and blot, we selected 14 proteins for further study as diagnostic antigen candidates (Table 2). We also selected 9 additional proteins from the > 150 previously-identified proteins that could be among the molecules that are responsible for this mite\u2019s ability to modulate its host\u2019s immune responses (Table 2) [12, 14]. The genes coding for these 23 proteins were deduced from the S. scabiei var. canis genome [20], chemically synthesized, and cloned into E. coli. The recombinant proteins were expressed and partially purified before being subjected to immunoblot screening. GelCode Coomassie blue stained gels showed that the purity of the recombinant proteins ranged from 10% to 95%.\nFor the first round of immunoscreening, ten pools of serum from patients with confirmed scabies infections were prepared based on prior screening [13, 18]. Another pool of sera from uninfected subjects was also prepared to serve as a negative control. Each of the 23 proteins was then screened with these 11 serum pools by slot blot. Eight of the 14 proteins that were selected as diagnostic antigen candidates were recognized by antibodies in \u2265 50% of the test serum pools (Table 2). None of the candidate immunomodulatory proteins bound antibodies in more than 20% of the test sera.\nThe 8 most promising diagnostic antigen candidates were subjected to a second round of screening using the serum of 30 individual US patients with ordinary scabies and 10 uninfected controls [13, 18]. One protein (KPM11752), a hypothetical protein that appears unique to scabies mites, was recognized by antibodies present in the serum of all scabies patients and all control subjects (Table 3). Three other proteins (KPM03215, KPM07763 and KPM10468) bound antibodies present in the serum of 40\u201367% of the scabies patients but they were also recognized by 10\u201340% of the control sera. Two of these are homologs of the Group 13 and 25 dust mite allergens. The remaining candidate proteins were recognized by \u2264 30% of the serum from the scabies patients.",
    "Discussion": "This research builds on previous proteomic work by identifying 50 different proteins produced by S. scabiei, 34 of which were not identified previously [14]. We determined that 66% of the protein-containing spots were recognized by IgM and/or IgG that is circulating in the serum of patients with ordinary scabies at the time of initial diagnosis and selected 14 of these for screening as candidates for use in a diagnostic test for scabies. Additionally, we identified 33 protein-containing spots, representing 16 different proteins, that were isolated from a Coomassie blue stained gel that did not bind patient antibody. Included among this set of proteins may be molecules that participate in the parasite\u2019s immune evasion mechanisms and are responsible for modulating the host\u2019s immune responses [1\u201312].\nUnfortunately none of the 14 proteins selected as potential diagnostic antigens shows enough promise to warrant further study. Only two proteins (KPM07763 and KPM11752) had sensitivities of \u2265 67% but neither offered a specificity of > 40% (Table 3). An additional 19 different antibody-binding proteins were identified on the 2D immunoblot and these are also potential candidates for use as diagnostic antigens (Table 1, Fig 2). It is possible that screening of these proteins could yield candidates promising better sensitivity and specificity than those reported here.\nPerhaps more interesting are the data for the 9 proteins selected for the possibility that they may be immunomodulatory. All were identified in a previous study [14] or were predicted from the genome [20] and none were detected on the 2D immunoblot (Fig 2). Among these were calmodulin-, calreticulin- and cystatin-like proteins, all of which have been shown to be produced by other parasites and to possess immunomodulatory properties [23, 24]. For a protein to be effective in assisting the mite to evade the host\u2019s immune response it would likely also be able to escape detection by the adaptive immune system and would not elicit an antibody response. As would be expected, 3 of the 9 proteins tested were recognized by antibodies in the serum of \u2264 20% of the scabietic patients while the other 6 did not bind any antibody. A logical next step would be to test these proteins for their immunomodulatory properties, although this was beyond the scope of the present study.\n\nConclusions\nThirty-three proteins that bound IgM and/or IgG from the serum of patients with ordinary scabies were identified. Although none of the 14 tested are useful for inclusion in a diagnostic test, the identity of 19 other candidates is provided. The identity of 16 proteins that are not recognized as antigens by infected patients was also determined. These could be among the molecules that are responsible for this mite\u2019s ability to modulate its host\u2019s innate and adaptive immune responses."
