Scabies, caused by the mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, infects millions of humans, and many wild and domestic mammals. Scabies mites burrow in the lower stratum corneum of the epidermis of the skin and are the source of substances that are antigenic or modulate aspects of the protective response of the host. Ordinary scabies is a difficult disease to diagnose. We identified 50 different proteins produced by S. scabiei, 33 of which bound IgM and/or IgG from the serum of patients with ordinary scabies. A set of 23 recombinant proteins were produced and screened for use in a diagnostic test but none possessed enough sensitivity and specificity to warrant further consideration although some could be among the molecules that are responsible for this mite’s ability to modulate its host’s innate and adaptive immune responses.
