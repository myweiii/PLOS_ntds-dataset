Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic worms that significantly impacts the lives of approximately 260 million people. During infection, female parasites can release thousands of eggs, a significant number of which become trapped in the liver. Entrapment of eggs triggers immune and inflammatory responses that in turn causes many of the health problems associated with the disease. In this study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of livers from mice infected with the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni over multiple time points, beginning when the parasites start to lay eggs. In mice treated with a lethal dose of the anti-schistosomal drug praziquantel, we identified a number of different genes and pathways central to immune and inflammatory responses that are active even in the absence of egg deposition. Praziquantel is the only drug available to treat schistosomiasis, however, it displays bimodal activity in that it is ineffective against juvenile parasites during the early stages of mammalian infection. We also show that development of drug resistance may be due to the improved efficacy of the juvenile parasite to actively excrete the drug. These results provide insights into the effect of praziquantel on the host response to infection as well as the ability of juvenile parasites to overcome the drugâ€™s lethal effect.
