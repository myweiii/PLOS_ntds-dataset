Contact tracing is one of the key response actions necessary for controlling spread of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Contact tracing is comprised of several different activities: identification of persons who have been in contact with confirmed EVD cases, close monitoring contacts for EVD symptoms, and management of symptomatic persons. Closely monitoring contacts of confirmed EVD cases allows for the rapid identification of symptomatic individuals, which in turn facilitates early testing, medical intervention, and isolation of new cases. This reduces the possibility of the continued spread of the virus within communities. Delayed and ineffective contact tracing contributed to the extensive transmission of EVD during the 2014â€“2015 outbreak in West Africa. Clusters of EVD reemergence are likely to occur, therefore understanding and addressing the challenges of implementing and managing contact tracing remains essential to halting transmission and minimizing morbidity and mortality associated with EVD. This paper assessed the contact tracing activities in response to EVD reemergence to identify best practices for responses to future Ebola clusters. The work is also applicable to contact tracing for other infectious diseases.
