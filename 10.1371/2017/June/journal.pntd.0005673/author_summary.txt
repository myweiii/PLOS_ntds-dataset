Flaviviruses, including Zika and Dengue viruses, and Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, are significant global public health threats. Genetic surveillance of viral isolates provides important insights into the origin of outbreaks, reveals lineage heterogeneity and diversification, and facilitates identification of novel recombinant strains and host cell modified viral genomes. We report the development of EvoPrinter, a web-accessed alignment tool for the rapid comparative analysis of viral genomes. EvoPrinter superimposes alignment data from multiple pairwise comparisons onto a single reference sequence of interest, to reveal both similarities and differences detected in hundreds of selected viral isolates. Evoprinter databases provide easy access to hundreds of non-redundant Flavivirus and Filovirus genomes. allowing the user to distinguish between sublineage identity SNPs and unique strain-specific SNPs, thus facilitating analysis of the history of viral diversification during an epidemic. EvoPrinter also proves useful in identifying recombinant strains and their parental lineages and detecting host-cell genomic editing. EvoPrinter should serve as a useful addition to existing tools for the comparative analysis of these viruses.
