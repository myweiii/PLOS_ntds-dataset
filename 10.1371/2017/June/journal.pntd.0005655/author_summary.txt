Antibody affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation (SHM) is thought to be critical for the development of antibodies with virus-neutralizing activity. Contrary to this notion, we describe novel human anti-Zika virus (ZIKV) antibodies with very low mutation levels, isolated from plasmablasts early after the onset of symptoms. Surprisingly, one IgG monoclonal antibody, P1F12, bound to ZIKV and neutralized the virus, despite having no detectable mutations. This antibody is specific for ZIKV and did not cross-react with DENV. Furthermore, plasma from ZIKV-positive individuals blocked the interaction of P1F12 with ZIKV, whereas plasma from DENV-positive patients did not have this inhibitory ability. P1F12 targets an immunodominant site, as ZIKV-positive samples blocked P1F12-ZIKV binding. Our study shows that isotype-switched virus-specific neutralizing Abs can develop in humans directly from germline sequences.
