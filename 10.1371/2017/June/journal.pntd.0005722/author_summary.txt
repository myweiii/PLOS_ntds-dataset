Some rodents and opossums can transmit zoonotic diseases, thereby causing economic losses and sanitary problems, including damage to livestock production systems worldwide. Identifying the factors affecting pathogen transmission will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved. In this study, the infection of four zoonotic pathogens in small mammals captured on intensive pig and dairy farms in central Argentina and potential environmental drivers of those infections were studied. Seven rodent and two opossum species were trapped on these farms. Murine rodents and opossums were infected with Leptospira spp. and Trichinella spp. and carried anti-Brucella spp. antibodies. Rattus norvegicus was also infected with C. fasciolaris, and some native rodents were infected with some of the studied pathogens. Each pathogen occurred on at least 50% of the farms, and two or more pathogens occurred on 89% of the farms. These results reflect a high circulation of zoonotic pathogens relevant to public health on intensive livestock farms. Moreover, all pathogen infections increased with host abundances. Murine rodents maintain pathogens within farms, whereas other native species are likely dispersing pathogens among farms.
