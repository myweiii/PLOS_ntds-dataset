We thank the staff of CEZD-NICD for logistical support of the SA FEDL operations in Sierra Leone. The operation of the SA FEDL in Sierra Leone was technically and logistically supported by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the SA National Health Laboratory Service, the SL MoHS, the SA National Department of Health and the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. In addition, the SA FEDL was supported by the International Research Division of Intramural Research National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, the International Atomic Energy Agency, Roche and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the provision of laboratory equipment, diagnostic consumables, reagents, and training in the use of equipment and procedures for automated RNA extraction. We also thank UNHAS and UNMEER for air transport of SA FEDL teams and laboratory supplies to Freetown.
In memoriam: Dr Abdul Kamara, who was instrumental in the selection of a site for the deployment of the SA FEDL, contributed greatly to the daily operation of the laboratory and organising transport and submission of specimens from EVD suspected cases, died before publication of this manuscript. We wish to honour his memory.
