Rabies is a viral disease that continues to threaten both human and animal health in endemic countries and almost always results in death of the infected individual. In most areas of Southeast Asia, rabies continues to be a major zoonosis with the main source of human cases being dog bites. In this study, we examined the brains of 415 rabies-suspected dogs from Vientiane Capital and some other provinces of Lao PDR during 2010â€“2016. Overall, rabies was confirmed in 284 cases. We found that there was a significant increase in rabies cases during the dry season (November to April) when monthly rainfall was less than <100mm. The laboratory-based surveillance of rabies in the domestic animal population is an important component of a rabies control program, however it should be used in conjunction with an effective vaccine program.
