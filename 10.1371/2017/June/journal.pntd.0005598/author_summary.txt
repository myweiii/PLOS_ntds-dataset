Leprosy, one of the most ancient human infectious diseases, affects skin and nerves and is caused by Mycobacterium leprae infection. Despite the effective use of multidrug therapy/MDT since the 80Â´s, over 200,000 new cases are reported yearly, indicating active transmission, especially in India and Brazil. Although rare, recurrent clinical manifestations after MDT can occur due to leprosy reactions, relapse by drug resistance, insufficient treatment or reinfection. Relapse and reinfection cannot be differentiated clinically and molecular genotyping of a predefined set of loci have limited resolution due to exceptional M. leprae genome conservation and low sequence diversity between strains from the same geographical area. This is the first report that has compared whole-genome sequences of M. leprae strains from original and recurrent leprosy episodes. M. leprae genome differences were detected between the strains from the first and second episodes in the three patients. In one patient, there was clear evidence for reinfection with an unrelated strain whereas the other two were considered true relapses due to minor strain differences. No known drug resistance mutations were detected, excluding drug resistance as the recurrence cause. Next generation sequencing of M. leprae DNA discriminates relapse from reinfection representing a powerful tool for evaluating different disease outcomes and transmission.
