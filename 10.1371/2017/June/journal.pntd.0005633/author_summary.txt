Lymphatic filariasis (LF) affects more than 120 million people worldwide, and is considered the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability. In response to the important burden of this disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) elaborated a strategic plan to eliminate LF as a public health problem through annual preventive chemotherapy (PC), repeated for at least six years, and reaching at least 65% of the population at risk. To date, about 5.63 billion cumulative treatments have been delivered since 2000, and more than 300 million people no longer require PC thanks to successful implementation of the WHO strategy. In Cameroon, PC for LF has been implemented since 2008. The aim of this study was to assess whether the transmission of LF has been interrupted. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in three evaluation units (EU) in northern Cameroon. The LF prevalence observed in each of these EU was lower than the threshold of infection below which transmission is likely no longer sustainable, suggesting that the transmission of LF has been interrupted in the study area.
