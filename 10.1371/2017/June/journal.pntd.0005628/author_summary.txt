Cryptococcal meningitis is a brain infection caused by a yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, and results in an estimated 600 000 deaths each year. Disease usually only occurs in patients who have some problem with their immune systems—most commonly Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. However, it is increasingly recognized that disease can occur, particularly in southeast and east Asia, in patients with apparently normal immune systems (‘immunocompetent’). We previously showed that almost all infections in immunocompetent patients in Vietnam are due to just one small ‘family’ (or lineage) of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, which we called VNIγ. This is in contrast to disease in HIV infected patients, which can be caused by a number of different families. This suggests that VNIγ strains have an increased ability to cause disease. Here, we define the pattern of disease caused by VNIγ infections compared with other strains in HIV infected patients, and use whole genome sequencing—comparing the entire genetic codes from different strains—to try and understand which genes give the VNIγ family this special ability to cause disease in immunocompetent patients.
