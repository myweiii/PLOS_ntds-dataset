Trachoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world; however, with proper interventions the disease can be controlled. Despite a paucity of experienced trachoma graders, insecurity, and difficulty accessing some villages, population-based impact surveys were conducted in five counties of South Sudan in 2015, with over 10,600 persons examined by trained and certified graders. Results showed that all five counties surveyed in Eastern Equatoria state of South Sudan face considerable trachoma burdens. The presence of water and sanitation were low in all five counties, including two counties which had a complete absence of latrines in all surveyed villages. The global community cannot expect to eliminate trachoma by 2020 if South Sudan is not provided with the human and financial resources it needs to not only understand the full extent of the disease in the country but also to implement programmatic interventions.
