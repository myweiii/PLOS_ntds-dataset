In many African countries, clinical management of children that present with symptoms of bacterial sepsis, such as typhoid fever (TF) caused by Salmonella Typhi, consists of empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. Blood culture remains the gold-standard for diagnosis, but is slow, suffers from poor sensitivity, and often unavailable. Consequently multi-drug resistant bacteria have emerged that are difficult to manage with antibiotics. There is an urgent need to develop rapid, sensitive and affordable tests for patient diagnosis, help curb antibiotic resistance, and inform public health preventive strategies such as the deployment of vaccines. Here, we have assessed antibodies to S. Typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hemolysin E (HylE, t1477) in the sera of Nigerian children with acute TF and compared them with heathy children, children with other febrile infections, and adults from around the world with a variety of other bacterial infections. The key finding concerns LPS. This is a common cell-wall component present in many bacterial species. Yet despite this, S. Typhi LPS-specific IgA and IgM are excellent markers of acute TF in Nigerian children, and insensitive to other non-salmonelloses. This surprising finding suggests a rapid point-of-care test for TF can be developed based on detection of LPS-specific IgA+IgM.
