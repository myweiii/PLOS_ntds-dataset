Melioidosis is a serious, and often fatal community-acquired infection endemic to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is caused by the environmental saprophyte Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium that is intrinsically resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. Its presence in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, has been documented, and recently, a novel gentamicin-susceptible strain discovered. However, there are limited data on the burden and clinical characteristics of melioidosis in Sarawak, both in adults and in children. In this study, we comprehensively investigated all pediatric melioidosis cases in Central Sarawak over a 6-year period. We found that this region has a very high incidence of pediatric melioidosis, and that children frequently presented with disseminated disease and had high fatality rates, despite the absence of any predisposing risk factor. We confirmed that these infections were caused predominantly by gentamicin-susceptible B. pseudomallei strains. We also highlighted other undescribed epidemiological, clinical and microbiological features, which may help in the overall understanding of B. pseudomallei infections. We emphasized the importance of improving the awareness and recognition of melioidosis in children, both in Sarawak and in other endemic regions.
