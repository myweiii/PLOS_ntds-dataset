    "Background": "Better knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics of snakebites could help to take measures to improve their management. The incidence and mortality of snakebites in the Americas are most often estimated from medical and scientific literature, which generally lack precision and representativeness.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Authors used the notifications of snakebites treated in health centers collected by the Ministries of Health of the American countries to estimate their incidence and mortality. Data were obtained from official reports available on-line at government sites, including those of the Ministry of Health in each country and was sustained by recent literature obtained from PubMed. The average annual incidence is about 57,500 snake bites (6.2 per 100,000 population) and mortality is close to 370 deaths (0.04 per 100,000 population), that is, between one third and half of the previous estimates. The incidence of snakebites is influenced by the abundance of snakes, which is related to (i) climate and altitude, (ii) specific preferences of the snake for environments suitable for their development, and (iii) human population density. Recent literature allowed to notice that the severity of the bites depends mainly on (i) the snake responsible for the bite (species and size) and (ii) accessibility of health care, including availability of antivenoms.",
    "Conclusions/Significances": "The main limitation of this study could be the reliability and accuracy of the notifications by national health services. However, the data seemed consistent considering the similarity of the incidences on each side of national boundaries while the sources are distinct. However, snakebite incidence could be underestimated due to the use of traditional medicine by the patients who escaped the reporting of cases. However, gathered data corresponded to the actual use of the health facilities, and therefore to the actual demand for antivenoms, which should make it possible to improve their management."
