Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is caused by the establishment of Taenia solium larvae in the human central nervous system. While NCC diagnosis, treatment, and prevention have clearly improved in the last 40 years, the disease still causes significant morbidity and mortality in endemic regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Herein we described demographic, clinical, radiological, and cerebrospinal fluid features of a large series of NCC patients, and evaluated the relevance of parasite location on disease presentation. 191 patients with parenchymal parasites, 125 patients with extraparenchymal cysts, and 113 patients lodging parasites in both locations were included. Our results clearly demonstrated that differences in parasite location actually determines distinct diseases, with wide variations in severity. This is particularly evident when comparing parenchymal with extraparenchymal patients and ventricular with subarachnoid patients. Gender and age also modulate some characteristics of the disease. In conclusion, parasite location is one of the most important features of the disease, which must be considered when approaching an NCC patient.
