Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes fever, rash, and acute and chronic arthralgia. Currently there are no approved therapies to treat or vaccines to prevent CHIKV infection in humans. In this study, we engineered SVIR001, a recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that eliminated viremia, reduced viral load at the site of infection, and diminished spread to distant target tissues in rhesus macaques when administered after infection. SVIR001 treatment reduced joint inflammation and disease without impairing the induction of the adaptive immune response. These results demonstrate the efficacy of mAb therapy to reduce the severity of CHIKV disease.
