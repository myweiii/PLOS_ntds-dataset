Neglected tropical diseases caused by parasites of the genera Trypanosoma and Leishmania affect millions of people, primarily in the developing world. Due to a historical lack of incentive or interest, few new drugs have been developed to treat these conditions. Numerous efforts have targeted the metabolism of trypanothione, an essential molecule for maintaining the redox homeostasis of these parasites. This study uses freely available structural databases and computational tools to identify new druggable sites on several essential proteins in these organisms by disrupting the protein-protein interactions that allow multimeric enzymes to function. Five of the targets identified in this study are involved in redox homeostasis, while the remainder are involved in other essential metabolic or biosynthetic processes. Nine have been identified in other computational databases, and two have already been experimentally verified, which suggests that protein-protein interaction inhibition of multimeric enzymes may be a general and viable route for the development of new trypanocidal agents.
