The ZIKV was responsible for a large pandemic surge between 2015 and 2016; Brazil was the epicenter with very high numbers of congenital ZIKV syndrome that included microcephaly, myalgia, among other manifestations. We have observed in previous work that muscle progenitor cells (myoblasts) are infected by ZIKV, while differentiated cells (myotubes) do not present viral proteins. In the present study, we confirmed human myoblasts susceptibility to ZIKV infection and myotubes resistance. In fact, we show that myotubes are also susceptible to ZIKV entry but control the productive infection. We also elucidated the transcriptional mechanisms triggered by the ZIKV, which stimulated a more complex intrinsic antiviral response in myotubes than in myoblasts. Such particular gene modulation of the differentiated cells could offer clues to antiviral mechanisms. It would explain susceptibility differences between adults, where muscle progenitor cells are quiescent in the steady-state, and foetuses that have large amounts of these cells proliferating in order to grow muscles.
