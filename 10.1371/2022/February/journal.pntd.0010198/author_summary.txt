Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global public health threat. The non-specific clinical manifestations of dengue overlap with signs and symptoms of other febrile illnesses common to tropical and subtropical zones making differential diagnosis between dengue and bacterial infections difficult, hence, leading to potentially unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. However, our understanding of factors underlying antibiotic prescribing for dengue is rather limited. Taiwan has experienced periodic dengue outbreaks and has a comprehensive national health insurance database including reliable infectious diseases surveillance and prescribing records. The findings in Taiwan show that other than commonly known patient characteristics, provider and contextual factors play a significant role. Physicianâ€™s age and practice setting were significant factors influencing the decision to prescribe antibiotics, particularly in outpatient visits. The likelihood of prescribing an antibiotic to dengue patients was reduced by more than 50% in medical visits occurring after the dengue infection was confirmed. Understanding patient, provider and contextual factors in antibiotics prescription for dengue infections can provide insights for improved antibiotic stewardship and unnecessary antibiotic treatment for dengue.
