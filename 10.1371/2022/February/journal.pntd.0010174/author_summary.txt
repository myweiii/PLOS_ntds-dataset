Novel treatment regimens for the radical cure of P. vivax malaria are more effective than current options but require prior quantitative G6PD testing. The reference method for quantitative G6PD measurement is spectrophotometry but, due to its operational characteristics, is not suitable for routine use. Furthermore, poor inter-laboratory reproducibility of spectrophotometry has prevented quantitative global definitions of G6PD deficiency. SD Biosensor (ROK) have developed a novel handheld “Biosensor” device (G6PD STANDARD), which measures G6PD activity within two minutes and has operational characteristics suited to point of care diagnosis. Reported accuracy of the Biosensor against spectrophotometry is around 90%, but its reproducibility remains unknown. This article reports the reproducibility of the device. Standardized samples were tested in two phases, first by a single user on ten Biosensors and then by ten independent users. All users received a standardized one-hour online training. Measured G6PD activities did not differ significantly across all devices in either phase, demonstrating the capacity to provide user-independent results. If further studies under real life conditions generate comparable results, the Biosensor will allow global cut offs for G6PD deficiency to be defined and will greatly simplify the roll out of novel highly effective radical cure treatment regimens for P. vivax infections.
