Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease characterised by the formation of tumorous swellings and the presence of grains. In fungal mycetoma (eumycetoma), the most common causative agents produce black grains although genetically, these fungi can be very different. Madurella mycetomatis, Madurella pseudomycetomatis and Madurella tropicana belong to the fungal order Sordariales, while Falciformispora senegalensis and Medicopsis romeroi belong to the order Pleosporales. Treatment for eumycetoma is challenging and antifungal therapy with itraconazole or terbinafine is combined with surgery. Unfortunately, cure rates of only 26% are obtained and amputation of the affected area is often needed. Despite the urgent need to find new antifungals for the treatment of eumycetoma, only fosravuconazole is in the pipeline to treat mycetoma. To discover novel compounds with activity against eumycetoma causative agents, the Open Source Mycetoma (MycetOS) initiative was founded. As part of this initiative, we previously tested 800 compounds from the Pathogen Box and Stasis box for their efficacy against M. mycetomatis. In this study, we have tested 400 compounds from the Pandemic Response Box against Madurella mycetomatis, Madurella pseudomycetomatis, Madurella tropicana, Falciformispora senegalensis and Medicopsis romeroi. We have identified four compounds that were able to inhibit all five fungi species in vitro, namely fenbendazole, carbendazim, tafenoquine and MMV1578570. Fenbendazole, MMV1782387, ravuconazole and olorofim were also able to significantly prolong larvae survival in our in vivo Galleria mellonella model. This study showed benzimidazole carbamates as promising candidates to further explore for eumycetoma treatment.
