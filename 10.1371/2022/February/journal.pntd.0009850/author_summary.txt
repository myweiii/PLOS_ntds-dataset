Leprosy is a chronic dermato-neurological disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, an obligate intracellular bacterium. Diagnosis of leprosy often relies on skin examinations for clinical signs, bacilli staining from skin smears and invasive skin biopsies. However, the spectrum of clinical manifestations and, often, low bacilli numbers can hinder accurate diagnosis. Timely detection is a challenge in leprosy diagnosis, relying on clinical examination and requiring trained health professionals. Proper intervention for adequate care and transmission control depends on early and reliable pathogen detection. Quantitative PCR methods for detecting bacterial DNA are more sensitive and could aid in differentially diagnosing leprosy from other dermatological conditions. In this work, we present a new multiplex PCR that was assessed for quality control standards, and the data indicate that the assay is stable and reproducible. The results presented here are the basis of a novel and robust tool with potential to increase the accuracy of leprosy diagnosis in routine or reference laboratories.
