Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, has traditionally been confined to endemic locations in South America (with vectorial transmission), but is nowadays emerging in Europe, mainly in Spain, due to immigration.
A series of characteristics of this disease condition its management. It is usually asymptomatic (especially in early stages), it can be transmitted from mothers to child (vertical transmission) and treatment is more effective at a younger age or during the early stages of infection. For these reasons early diagnosis and treatment of infected children is a priority. To date, there are few publications on pediatric CD series in non-endemic regions. In this paper we describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 51 children diagnosed with pediatric CD in a non-endemic area, as well as the the safety and efficacy of treatment in this patient population.
We found that most patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. The cure percentage was clearly higher when they were treated before one year-old (80% vs 4.3% in children older than one).Adverse events to treatment have occurred especially in older children, being frequent in this age group (median age 11 years).
The high proportion of patients lost to follow-up that occurs in this vulnerable population is also noteworthy (35.3% in our case). We highlight, as a conclusion of our study, the need of carrying out systematic screening for this disease (women of childbearing age, children of mothers with positive serology) to reduce the rate of vertical transmission and to achieve higher cure rates and better tolerance to treatment.
