Anthrax is a bacterial disease that causes rapid death in livestock, particularly cattle. Humans can be infected when they touch or eat animal carcasses or animal products, or when they inhale bacterial spores that have been aerosolized from the environment. Depending on how the bacterium enters the body, it causes cutaneous, gastrointestinal/oropharyngeal or respiratory disease in humans; death is rare for cutaneous anthrax but is more common with ingestion and inhalation forms of the disease. Anthrax has a global distribution but some areas of the world–such as Ethiopia–experience annual outbreaks in animals and humans. In this report, we present the findings from the first PCR-confirmed outbreaks in Ethiopia. In both outbreaks, the lack of farmer awareness and inherent economic value of livestock led farmers to salvage carcasses of animals that died, for meat and hides. Community members who participated in skinning and butchering of carcasses, eating or handling the meat, or processing hides/skins of suspect animal cases developed clinical signs consistent with anthrax (22 humans in Outbreak 1 including two suspected deaths; and 18 in Outbreak 2 including one suspected death). Further, animal parts from index cases (one cow in Outbreak 1; and one cow and one goat from Outbreak 2) were improperly discarded around the environment, leading a further 48 cows to become infected and die in Outbreak 1. Three humans in Outbreak 1 tested positive for anthrax on PCR. In addition, a swab taken from the dried meat of an animal that died in Outbreak 2 was positive by PCR. In both outbreaks, control was enacted through recalling and disposing remaining animal products, vaccination of livestock in surrounding areas and community education.
