The P. pastoris strain (smPP) and pPICZ vectors used to express APRT1 and APRT2 were a generous gift from Dr. Arthur Laganowsky (Texas A&M University, Department of Chemistry). Samantha Schrecke (Texas A&M University, Department of Chemistry) provided assistance with establishing expression conditions for APRT1 and APRT2 in P. pastoris. Zahra Moghadamchargari (Texas A&M University, Department of Chemistry) collected the native mass spectrometry data for recombinant APRT2-Ntag and APRT2-Ctag.
