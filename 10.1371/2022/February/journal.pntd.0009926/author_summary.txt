Neglected Tropical Diseases, including Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), are defined by the World Health Organization as a diverse group of 20 different diseases that disproportionally affect the worldâ€™s poorest populations. HAT is endemic to 36 African countries and approximately 70 million people worldwide are currently at risk for infection. Current therapeutics are suboptimal due to toxicity, adverse side effects, and emerging resistance. The causative agent of HAT is Trypanosoma brucei ssp. Unlike humans, these protozoan parasites rely on purine phosphoribosyltransferases to salvage purine bases from their hosts for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Here we report on the characterization of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) activity in Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Enzymes involved in adenine and adenosine salvage, such as APRTs, are of particular interest for their potential role in the activation of adenine and adenosine-based pro-drugs. Our studies reveal that of the two putative APRTs, only APRT1 is kinetically active under physiological conditions. Accurate genome annotations in combination with the characterization of purine salvage enzymes allows the development of target-specific therapies.
