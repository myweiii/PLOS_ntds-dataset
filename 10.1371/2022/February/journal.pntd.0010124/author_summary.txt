Globally there are approximately 59,000 annual human rabies deaths, with more than 99% of these resulting from dog-mediated rabies. Mass dog vaccination is known to be the cornerstone of effective control of dog rabies. Empirical and theoretical evidence shows that annual vaccination campaigns need to achieve 70% coverage of the susceptible dog population to interrupt transmission and ensure the dog population is protected until the next campaign. Recently, international organizations announced their commitment to reaching the global target of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. Scaling-up of vaccinations is now underway in more than 100 rabies-endemic countries. However, there are operational and logistical challenges associated with scaling-up these operations in different geographical and cultural settings. This study monitored and evaluated the performance large-scale vaccinations in Tanzania. We found that vaccinations were not implemented in all villages, which resulted in coverage gaps. Additionally, vaccinations were not implemented annually and, as a result, coverage dropped below the critical vaccination threshold. We conclude that there is a need to improve the delivery of dog vaccinations for achieving the global target of zero dog-mediated human rabies deaths by 2030.
