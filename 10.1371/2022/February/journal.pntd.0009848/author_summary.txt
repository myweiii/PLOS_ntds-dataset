The occurrence of arboviruses is increasing and causing significant impacts on human health. This is of high concern in small Pacific island nations where fragile health systems are regularly overwhelmed by disease outbreaks. To effectively prevent and control disease transmission there is a need to understand which viruses have been in circulation. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of residents from 5 study sites distributed across the Solomon Islands. The serum samples were tested for antibodies that indicate prior infection for four arboviruses. We found evidence that the residents of the Solomon Islands have been exposed to substantial transmission of dengue and Ross River viruses, with lower levels of Zika and chikungunya transmission. Two large dengue outbreaks have been recently experienced and the outbreak pattern suggests that natural herd immunity may still be a driver of dengue outbreak dynamics in the Solomon Islands. Regarding Ross River virus, transmission is endemic despite being undetected prior to this survey. There is a real need to increase the capacity to accurately diagnose each of these arboviruses to support effective case management and to provide timely information to inform vector control efforts.
