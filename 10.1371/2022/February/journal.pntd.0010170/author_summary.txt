Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) represent a serious threat to humans, especially for those living in poor or developing countries. Leishmanianiosis is considered a zoonotic NTD transmitted by the bite of female phlebotomine sandflies, and is manifested mainly as a visceral form (caused by L. infantum and L. donovani) and a cutaneous form (caused by many species including L. major, L. tropica and L. braziliensis). Although it is now known that sexual reproduction occurs in these parasites, more studies are necessary to characterize the ability of Leishmania to generate hybrids, which may represent an important mechanism for virulence, drug resistance or adaptation to the host immune system. Therefore, several experiments were conducted to generate either intraclonal or interspecies hybrids in vitro. Results demonstrated that hybrids can be formed even with outcrosses between parasites causing visceral and cutaneous forms of the disease. Characterization of hybrids in terms of ploidy, kDNA content, growth rate and infection capacity provide important information about sexual reproduction in these parasites.
