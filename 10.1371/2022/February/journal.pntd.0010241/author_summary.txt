Leptospirosis is a potential fatal zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution caused by a bacterium found in contaminated sources of water and soil. Diagnosis of leptospirosis is tentatively based on evaluation of fever and myalgia in patients presenting at the hospital in areas of endemicity, and it is rarely confirmed in most parts of the world due to lack of affordable diagnostic tests. We developed a highly sensitive and specific serologic test for leptospirosis using ubiquitous enzyme immunoassay technology. In areas where circulating serovars of pathogenic Leptospira are well defined, versatile enzyme immunoassays can be adapted and operated at a fraction of the cost of the cumbersome gold standard Microscopic Agglutination Test and should be explored as accurate serodiagnostic tools for leptospirosis. Addition of specific immunoglobulin G isotyping (IgG3/IgG1) can further inform diagnosis of acute leptospirosis.
