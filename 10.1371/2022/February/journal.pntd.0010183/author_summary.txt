More than 58,000 people die of snakebites each year in India. Russell’s viper, saw scaled viper and pit vipers are widely distributed and medically important venomous snakes in India responsible for significant deaths and disabilities. Clinicians need easy-to-use bedside tools to make decisions on which patients are at a higher risk of dying after viper bites. In this study, conducted in Southern India, where Russell’s viper is the commonest viper causing bites, we have evolved and validated a simple risk prediction score. This uses seven clinical and laboratory features to estimate a patient’s risk of dying in the hospital due to the bite. The study showed that the score has good predictive ability when tested in a similar population of patients. We expect that the score is the first step in developing a tool that is likely to help health workers and doctors assess a patient’s risk in primary-care peripheral or rural settings to help decide on early referral of high-risk patients who are likely to worsen.
