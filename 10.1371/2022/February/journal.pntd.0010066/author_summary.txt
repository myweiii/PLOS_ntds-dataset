N. atra bites cause extensive wound necrosis and/or NSTI instead of neuroparalytic effect. We retrospectively evaluated 161 patients envenomed by N. atra, 80 of whom underwent surgeries because of wound necrosis and secondary infection. We found five variables—lower limb as the bite site, a ≥3 swelling grade, bullae or blister formation, GI effects, and fever that occurred rapidly after the bites—that were significant associated with surgery in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The risk scores for these variables when integer the regression coefficients were 1, 1, 2, 1, and 2, respectively. The predictive value of these factors for surgery is acceptable, with a ≥3-point score. The common laboratory parameters did not always predict the outcomes of N. atra bites in the absence of proper wound evaluation. Deep tissue cultures and histopathological examinations supported the diagnosis of snakebite-induced NSTI. The bacterial species obtained during initial surgery differs from those obtained in subsequent surgeries, suggesting secondary colonization or nosocomial infections. These findings may be helpful for clinicians in better management and disposition of patients with N. atra bites.
