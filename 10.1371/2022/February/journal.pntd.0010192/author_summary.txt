Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Shigella spp (Shigella) causes significant global morbidity and mortality, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Since culture methods to detect Shigella are not sensitive, and the methods used to detect ETEC have not been feasible outside of specialized, well-equipped laboratories, the true burden of these pathogens at national and sub-national levels are mostly not available. Morbidity and mortality estimates, for these two pathogens are crucial to assess their relative public health importance in LMICs. We developed a simple and rapid diagnostic assay called the RLDT (Rapid Loop-mediated isothermal amplification based Diagnostic Test) for detection of ETEC and Shigella. In this study we evaluated RLDT compared to other currently available assays using previously collected stool samples. Our data showed that the RLDT assay exhibited high sensitivity and specificity for detection of ETEC and Shigella, with its result available within 50 minutes. The sensitivity of RLDT was higher than culture for these pathogens. We conclude that RLDT could be used as a rapid and simple diagnostic test to determine the burden of ETEC and Shigella in LMICs as well as in clinical vaccine trials of these pathogens.
