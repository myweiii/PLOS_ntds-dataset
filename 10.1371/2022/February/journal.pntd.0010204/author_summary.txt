The transcriptomic gene expression of the olfactory tissues of Cx. quinquefasciatusthe and Cx. molestus differ significantly. The majority of ORs and OBPs are expressed in both subspecies but are clearly differentiated in expression level. OR5 and OR65 may be species-specific olfactory genes expressed in Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. molestus, respectively. After the microinjection of OR5-dsRNA and OR78-dsRNA into female Cx. quinquefasciatus adults, the blood-feeding rate was significantly lower than that of the control group, suggesting that OR5 and OR78 are associated with the blood-feeding behavior of Cx. quinquefasciatus.
