Epidemics are among the most costly and destructive natural hazards occurring globally; currently, the response to epidemics is still focused on reaction rather than prevention or preparedness. The development of an epidemic risk index can support identifying high-risk areas and can guide prioritization of preventive action and humanitarian response. While several frameworks for epidemic risk assessment exist, they suffer from several limitations, which resulted in limited uptake by local health actors—such as governments and humanitarian relief workers—in their decision-making processes. In this study, we present a methodology to develop epidemic risk indices, which overcomes the major limitations of previous work: strict data requirements, insufficient geographical granularity, validation against epidemiological data. We take as a case study dengue in the Philippines and develop an epidemic risk index; we correct dengue incidence for underreporting based on accessibility to healthcare and show that it correlates well with the risk index (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.69, p-value 0.002). Our methodology enables the development of disease-specific epidemic risk indices at a sub-national level, even in countries with limited data availability; these indices can guide local actors in programming prevention and response activities. Our findings on the case study show that the epidemic risk index is a strong indicator of sub-national dengue disease patterns and is therefore suitable for disease risk assessments in the absence of timely and complete epidemiological data.
