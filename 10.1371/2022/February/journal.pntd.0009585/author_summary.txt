Trypanosomes are protozoan parasites causing Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) in sub Saharan Africa. Millions of people are at risk while millions of animals die from infection causing tremendous economic losses. This has aggravated poverty on African continent. So far, there is no vaccine available against the disease. Therefore, other strategies must be developed to combat the menace. Trans-sialidases (TS), a group of structurally similar enzymes with varying enzyme activities have been implicated in the pathogenicity of the disease. We developed a strategy to modify TS to shed light towards a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these enzymes. Here we report a so far unidentified function of TSâ€™s lectin-like domain (TS-LD) and the involvement of glycans in that process. This will impact on the possible development of new strategies against the virulent factors of trypanosomiasis.
