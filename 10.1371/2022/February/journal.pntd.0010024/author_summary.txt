An outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF)–a zoonotic mosquito-borne viral infection widespread in Africa, was reported in 2013–14 in Senegal. After its end in late 2014, its spatial distribution and drivers were assessed using a national serological survey in small ruminants, thus highlighting the high exposition of humans to RVF virus in urban areas.
