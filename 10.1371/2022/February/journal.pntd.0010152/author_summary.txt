Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes non-specific symptoms such as fever, and the infection is sometimes misinterpreted as other viral infections, such as dengue and Zika. Although serological tests are commonly used to diagnose CHIKV infection, the reliability of these tests is questionable due to their highly variable performance. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of these serological tests. As the analytes (antigen and antibodies) are present in the patientâ€™s sample at different time points of CHIKV infection, we analysed the diagnostic performance of serological tests detecting CHIKV antigen, IgM, and IgG antibodies. Our meta-analysis showed that antigen or antibody-based serological tests could reliably be used to diagnose CHIKV, depending on the time of sample collection. Antigen detection test serves as a good diagnostic test for samples collected within the acute phase (1 to 7 days) of CHIKV infections. On the other hand, the IgM and IgG tests can be used for convalescent-phase (>7 days of symptom onset) samples, differentiating recent and past CHIKV infections. Although IgM antibodies start to develop as early as 2 to 4 days of CHIKV infection, our result showed that the IgM detection tests for acute-phase samples exhibited low accuracy. Thus, the IgM detection test is not recommended for samples collected <7 days of symptoms onset.
