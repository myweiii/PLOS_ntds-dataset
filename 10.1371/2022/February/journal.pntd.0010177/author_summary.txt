Diarrheal diseases remain a major health threat around the world. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) are a group of bacteria that are among the leading causes of diarrheal disease in travelers and children under five. One characteristic of ETEC are the diverse surface proteins used to colonize the gut of mammals. We have developed a single protein vaccine candidate called a multi-epitope fusion antigen (MEFA) that elicits antibody production in mice and pigs against seven diverse colonization factors. Here, we took advantage of a rabbit model of ETEC colonization to determine if immunization with this MEFA can provide direct protection against colonization of the small intestine. Our results indicate that immunization of rabbits with the candidate vaccine elicits antibodies that bind to seven colonization factors included in its construction and protects against colonization of a challenge strain that consistently colonized unvaccinated rabbits. This study provides additional evidence to support the MEFA strategy for generating a broadly protective vaccine for ETEC and other diverse enteric pathogens.
