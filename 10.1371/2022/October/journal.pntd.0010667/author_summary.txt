Schistosomiasis is one of the major parasitic diseases with socio-economic and health importance in the developing world. Control of snail intermediate hosts of human schistosomes is an essential part of the program on fighting schistosomiasis. This study evaluated the effect of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) on the snail intermediate hosts of Schistosoma mansoni, i.e. Biomphalaria alexandrina, B. glabrata, and the intermediate host of S. japonicum, i.e. Oncomelania hupensis. The results revealed that LC50 values of Ag-NPs against B. alexandrina, B. glabrata and O. hupensis were 7.91, 16.55 and 46.5 ppm, respectively, after 24 hrs of exposure. The results also revealed that O. hupensis snails tolerate better the toxic effect of Ag-NPs than B. alexandrina and B. glabrata snails. We also demonstrated that the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna tolerate even higher concentration of Ag-NPs compared to the three species of snail intermediate hosts of schistosomes. Experiments on exposure of B. alexandrina to the sub-lethal concentration (LC25) of Ag-NPs obviously altered the antioxidant enzymes in the snailâ€™s hemolymph. From the aforementioned results, Ag-NPs exhibited a promising molluscicidal activity against the snail intermediate hosts of human schistosomes, could eventually be used in the national schistosomiasis control program.
