    "Abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a notifiable disease in Sri Lanka with increasing case numbers reported from every part of the country. In addition to disease treatment and vector control measures, knowledge and perceptions in a community are key contributors to a successful intervention program. An island-wide survey was carried out to assess the knowledge and perceptions regarding CL across the island, with 252 confirmed CL cases and 2,608 controls. Data was collected by trained personnel, using a pre-tested Case Reporting Form (CRF). Although the percentage who referred to CL by its correct name was low (1.4%), majority stated that it is a fly induced skin disease (79.1%). Knowledge on the symptoms, curability and the name of the vector was high in these communities, but specific knowledge on vector breeding places, biting times and preventive methods were poor. The patients were more knowledgeable when compared to the controls. Differences in the level of knowledge could be identified according to the level of education of the participants as well as across the different areas of the country. The main source of information was through the healthcare system, but the involvement of media in educating the communities on the disease was minimal. While this study population was unaccustomed to the use of repellants or sprays, the use of bed nets was high (77.7% of the participants) in this study population. Although misconceptions and incorrect practices are rare in Sri Lankan communities, promoting health education programs which may improve disease awareness and knowledge on vector and its control will further strengthen the control and prevention strategies."
