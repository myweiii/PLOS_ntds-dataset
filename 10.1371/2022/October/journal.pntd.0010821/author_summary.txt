Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a disease which causes skin ulcers and spread by the sand fly. In recent years, the number of CL patients reported from all parts Sri Lanka increased notably, indicating that the spread of the disease should be controlled. The general publicsâ€™ knowledge on the disease and its control methods, is very important to implement a successful control program. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the level of knowledge of the local community on CL, its vector and control methods. The required information was collected by interviewing CL patients as well as healthy persons. More than 50% of both groups gave correct answers to more general questions about the disease such as the disease name, symptoms and spread, indicating that the awareness of CL among the public is satisfactory. However, the study also indicated that the patients were more knowledgeable when compared to the healthy persons. Furthermore, it was evident that knowledge on more detailed information such as vector breeding places, vector biting times is poor in both groups and the healthcare system has been the primary source of information.
