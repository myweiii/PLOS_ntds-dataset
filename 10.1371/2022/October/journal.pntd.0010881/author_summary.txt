Pyruvate kinases belong to transferases and can transfer the high-energy phosphate bond of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to produce pyruvic acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate kinases play a significant biological role in the parasite survival in hosts. Our results revealed that TsPKM was expressed at various T. spiralis developmental stages, and principally located in the cuticle, stichosome, intestine and the intrauterine embryos of female adults. rTsPKM catalyzed the reaction of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to produce pyruvic acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). TsPKM played an important role in the metabolism and energy production of T. spiralis. Protein expression and enzyme activity of TsPKM were decreased by 50.91 and 26.06% respectively through silencing of TsPKM gene using specific dsRNA-TsPKM2. After treatment with RNAi and inhibitor tannin, natural TsPKM activity, larval molting, sugar metabolism, growth and development of T. spiralis were obviously inhibited. Our results showed that TsPKM participates in T. spiralis molting, sugar metabolism and development, and it might be a candidate target for anti-Trichinella drugs.
