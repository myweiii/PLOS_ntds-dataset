Aedes aegypti is a major threat to public health. Ae. aegypti is the primary vector of dengue virus types 1–4 (DENV 1–4), zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). Ae. aegypti acquires arboviruses from a vertebrate host during blood feeding. Blood feeding introduces vertebrate-specific factors into the mosquito that may be important for both mosquito and virus. This study reveals that Ae. aegypti adapts to depletion of vertebrate lipids by inhibiting lipolysis and promoting de novo synthesis of invertebrate lipids, and that DENV can replicate equally well without high concentrations of cholesterol and other vertebrate lipid species. Understanding how disease vectors adapt to nutritional changes will identify novel strategies for vector control and disease mitigation.
