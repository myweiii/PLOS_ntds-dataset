Communication is often seen as a central tool in NTD elimination strategies. However, the disciplinary framework of communication research is rarely considered in interventionsâ€™ design. To understand how communication action is conceived and practiced, we conducted a scoping review with a focus on two diseases currently targeted for elimination: lymphatic filariasis and Chagas disease. We examined 43 studies published between 2012 and 2020 to identify communication practices, theoretical frameworks informing communication action and levels of intended influence. Community participation was the goal most commonly pursued through communication action, both in LF and CD strategies; important attempts at expanding the scope and reach of this practice were identified. However, our results indicate that while the field of health communication has gained complexity in the understanding of the nature of communication ecologies in public health interventions, NTD research has maintained a superficial involvement with health communication theory and science. This article is a call to action to consider the resources offered by the health communication field when researching, designing, or implementing NTD interventions to enhance the possibilities of communication action in implementation settings.
