We analyzed data obtained from the Colombian Ministry of Health and the national meteorology center to determine the effect of precipitation on the new cases of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT). The number of interpolated daily cases was estimated and compared with the exposure (precipitation) by a quasi-Poisson regression, combined with a distributed lag non-linear model to estimate the lag, non-linear response curve, and a Pearson correlation test. In the 5-year study period, 1,741 new cases of OT were reported. We found significant differences in the trends among all departments, with most departments showing decreasing cumulative exposure-response curves. However, in Chocó, Bogotá, Cesar, Cauca, and Guajira, when a certain amount of precipitation accumulates, the relative risk (RR) increases, contrary to the pattern observed in the rest of the country. The response curves at one-day lag showed that precipitation influences the RR; however, trends vary by department. We found a positive correlation between the number of cases and precipitation (β = 0.03; P< 0.05), indicating that precipitation affects the RR of new cases of OT. However, inconsistent trends exist across geographical regions, leading us to hypothesize that other sociodemographic, behavioral, and environmental variables, such as wind and water contamination, might influence the RR.
