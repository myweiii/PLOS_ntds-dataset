Rift Valley fever outbreaks are reported in Tanzania every 10 to 15 years. Human and animal cases are not typically reported in the period between outbreaks, but the RVF virus (RVFV) is known to circulate among livestock during these periods. The last officially reported outbreak of RVF in Tanzania was in 2008. The incidence of RVFV infection among livestock in the period since this large epidemic in the country is not known. We used a general force of infection model to quantify the annual incidence of RVFV infection among livestock in northern Tanzania between 2009 and 2015, a period without reported RVF cases in people or animals. Using a sample of over 9,000 animals from 43 villages across northern Tanzania, we estimated a moderately low average annual incidence of 96, 39, and 79 RVFV infections per 10,000 cattle, goats, and sheep, respectively. There was considerable heterogeneity in the intensity of transmission between villages, highlighting important spatial differences in inter-epidemic RVFV transmission among livestock in this region. We also found that human seropositivity was strongly positively associated with the village-level force of RVFV infection among livestock. All people with seropositive results in this study were born before 2008. We therefore cannot be certain that these people were infected in the period since the last outbreak. However, the very strong positive association we find between inter-epidemic circulation of RVFV among livestock and human seropositivity provides support to the hypothesis that zoonotic RVFV spillover may be occuring during the period between large-scale outbreaks in northern Tanzania. Further studies are required to confirm this. We also found a strong positive association between a history of raw milk consumption and human RVFV seropositivity, providing further evidence for the importance of milk as a likely route for zoonotic RVFV transmission.
