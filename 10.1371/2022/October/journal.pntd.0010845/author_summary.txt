Prostaglandin F2α synthase (PGFS) has been associated with T. cruzi resistance to benznidazole (BZ), but the real involvement of this enzyme in the resistance phenotype is still uncertain since different studies in the literature point in different directions. Here we demonstrated that the deletion of all copies of the PGFS gene in T. cruzi does not affect the parasite’s resistance to BZ or nifurtimox (NFX), but results in reduced tolerance to oxidative stress caused by menadione. The PGFS knockout mutants are less infective, and, at the stationary phase, the parasites have fewer lipid bodies than the control parasites. Thus, our results suggest that this enzyme appears to have a regulatory role in defence against oxidative stress and parasite infectivity.
