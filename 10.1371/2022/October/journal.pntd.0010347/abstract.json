    "Abstract": "Leishmaniasis on the Indian subcontinent is thought to have an anthroponotic transmission cycle. There is no direct evidence that a mammalian host other than humans can be infected with Leishmania donovani and transmit infection to the sand fly vector. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of sand fly feeding on other domestic species and provide clinical evidence regarding possible non-human reservoirs through experimental sand fly feeding on cows, water buffalo goats and rodents. We performed xenodiagnosis using colonized Phlebotomus argentipes sand flies to feed on animals residing in villages with active Leishmania transmission based on current human cases. Xenodiagnoses on mammals within the endemic area were performed and blood-fed flies were analyzed for the presence of Leishmania via qPCR 48hrs after feeding. Blood samples were also collected from these mammals for qPCR and serology. Although we found evidence of Leishmania infection within some domestic mammals, they were not infectious to vector sand flies. Monitoring infection in sand flies and non-human blood meal sources in endemic villages leads to scientific proof of exposure and parasitemia in resident mammals. Lack of infectiousness of these domestic mammals to vector sand flies indicates that they likely play no role, or a very limited role in Leishmania donovani transmission to people in Bihar. Therefore, a surveillance system in the peri-/post-elimination phase of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) must monitor absence of transmission. Continued surveillance of domestic mammals in outbreak villages is necessary to ensure that a non-human reservoir is not established, including domestic mammals not present in this study, specifically dogs."
