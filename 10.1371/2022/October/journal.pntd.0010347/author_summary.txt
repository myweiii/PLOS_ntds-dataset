Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), has unique enzootic, zoonotic and anthroponotic life cycles dependent on geographic region. Most Leishmania spp. are zoonotic, transmitted between humans and non-human mammals. Leishmaniasis is endemic in over 98 countries and the estimated population at risk on the Indian sub-continent (ISC) is around 0.2â€“0.4 million people. Herein, we assess knowledge gaps in disease transmission that challenge dogma regarding the reservoir(s) of visceral leishmaniasis and control efforts on the Indian sub-continent. Better understanding of L. donovani infection in domestic animals and its transmission to sand flies will provide answers to fundamental questions in VL epidemiology and ecology. Blood samples were collected from livestock and rodents in endemic villages and colonized sand flies were fed on these animals and analyzed post feeding to see if they could pick up parasites via bloodmeal. We found that livestock and to a smaller extent rodents could be infected with or exposed to Leishmania infection. However, these mammals were not infectious to Phlebotomus argentipes, the predominant vector species incriminated as transmitting L. donovani in India. The inability of these domestic mammals to transmit L. donovani to sand flies in Bihar suggests that they play a limited role in the spread of infection. A key component in reducing and preventing the re-emergence of VL in the context of the elimination program is to understand the role of vector feeding on non-human animals in the transmission cycle. Better estimation of the proportion of the livestock and rodent population exposed to sand flies during different seasons and ensuring that there are not reservoir species that contribute to transmission will help implement appropriate control strategies for sustainable elimination.
