Human hookworm infections are primarily caused by two parasitic worm species, namely Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. Already moderate infection intensities can impair cognitive and physical development of children, and reduce fertility in women of reproductive age. The World Health Organization set the global target to eliminate morbidity due to hookworm infections in preschool-age and school-age children by 2030. To reach this goal, different public health interventions are carried out. The most widely used strategy is mass drug administration. To assess the efficacy of treatments, epidemiologic studies and clinical trials usually employ the Kato-Katz thick smear technique to microscopically examine stool samples of individuals before and after treatment. Of note, this diagnostic test is not 100% accurate such that not all positive individuals are detected. We developed a mathematical model, which takes into account the diagnostic error to compare the ‘true’ efficacy of different drugs and treatment regimens against hookworm infection. Furthermore, we computed how well the test detects infected individuals in relation to infection intensity. We found that the diagnostic sensitivity of the Kato-Katz thick smear technique increases considerably if two stool specimens from different days are collected and multiple Kato-Katz thick smears are analyzed instead of one.
