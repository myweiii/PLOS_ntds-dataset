Mosquito biting is a necessary and critical part of arbovirus transmission. The mosquito must bite once to acquire a virus and again to transmit, and these two bites must be separated by sufficient time for the virus to reach the salivary glands of the mosquito. Thus, both the number and timing of bites is important. We experimentally investigated how these bite characteristics might be different among individuals and further explored how temperature affected the overall heterogeneity of biting in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which carry many arboviruses like dengue virus (DENV). We found that the biting profiles–including number and timing thereof–did vary within temperature groups among individuals and compared outcomes associated with each individual in an individual–based model of household DENV transmission. Our results further confirmed that temperatures around 28°C are optimal for mosquito biting (and transmission), that correlations between biting characteristics and transmission were not uniform across temperature, which represents another layer of heterogeneity, and that–at least at 28°C–the null assumption of an exponential or an exponential–like (geometric) distribution of biting in mathematical models of transmission is not the best and offer an alternative.
