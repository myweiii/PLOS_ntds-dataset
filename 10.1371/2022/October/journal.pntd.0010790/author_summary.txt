Acute illness with fever is common but can be challenging for clinicians to manage, particularly in resource-limited settings. In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria is a major cause of fever, but other causes of fever are poorly documented or monitored, which impairs optimal medical care to patients and implementation of public health interventions to control leading causes of disease. Viruses transmitted by mosquitoes are a prevalent and expanding problem throughout the tropics and beyond; however, there is concern that these infections frequently go undetected in sub-Saharan Africa. We discovered a previously unrecognized outbreak of dengue virus in western Cameroon by testing remnant samples from over 400 patients that presented with fever. Our results indicate that dengue has circulated in this region for decades with little recognition. This study adds important information about causes of fever in sub-Saharan Africa and advocates for increasing investment in surveillance systems and prevention strategies for mosquito-borne viruses.
