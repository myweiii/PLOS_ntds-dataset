A potentially new species of Campylobacter, “Candidatus Campylobacter infans” has been recently identified using culture independent diagnostic techniques. This study determined its prevalence using qPCR in diarrhea and non-diarrheal samples of children under the age of two, and confirmed results using shotgun metagenomics. The presence of “Candidatus Campylobacter infans” was not associated with diarrhea in this population.
