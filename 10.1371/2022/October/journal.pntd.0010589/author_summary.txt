Leptospirosis, a life-threatening disease in humans and animals, is one of the most widespread global zoonosis. Contaminated soil and water are major sources of transmission in humans and animals. For this reason, clusters of disease outbreaks are common during the rainy season. In this study, Leptospira enrichment cultures followed by PCR and sequencing detected pathogenic and nonpathogenic Leptospira in soil and water samples. However, pathogenic and intermediate groups of Leptospira were more prevalent in soil samples tested. Metagenomic sequencing on enrichment culture was effective in detecting the abundance and diversity of various Leptospira spp. in environmental samples. Soil samples in proximity to water may be an ideal niche for Leptospira growth and survival and may be an appropriate sample of choice for testing.
