We injected West Nile virus into seronegative individuals of two bird species, American Robin and Common Grackle, and then fed Culex pipiens mosquitoes on these birds during the viremic period. We found that, despite having equivalent or lower levels of viremia, robins infected significantly more mosquitoes than did grackles. The reasons for this are not known, but our results indicate that the relationship between host viremia and infectiousness is not always straight forward and may vary among different host species. To gain precise information for a mosquito-borne arbovirus system, it is best to conduct mosquito feedings on live viremic hosts rather than extrapolate the infectiousness of a host species based solely on its viremia profile.
