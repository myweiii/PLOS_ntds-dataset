Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic medication widely used in the treatment of a variety of parasitic worm infections. Previous studies have demonstrated marked variation in the pharmacokinetics of albendazole (and its pharmacologically active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide), leading to substantial inter-individual variability in blood plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide following an oral dose of albendazole. This variation is thought to have consequences for treatment success but our understanding of the factors driving this variation remains incomplete. In this study, we carried out a systematic review to identify references with data on albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in plasma following a single oral dose. We then fitted a mathematical model of albendazole sulfoxide pharmacokinetics to these data to infer key pharmacokinetic parameters and relate them to characteristics of the groups being treated. We found that: 1) receipt of a fatty meal prior to treatment was associated with increased albendazole sulfoxide systemic availability; 2) the half-life of albendazole sulfoxide varied significantly with age, and 3) both echinococcosis and neurocysticercosis were associated with altered albendazole sulfoxide pharmacokinetic profiles compared to healthy individuals. Our work provides insight into some of the factors systematically associated with variation in albendazole sulfoxide pharmacokinetics.
