Data on the burden and clinical epidemiology of skin wounds in rural sub-Saharan Africa is scant. The scale of the problem including preventable progression to chronic wounds, disability and systemic complications is largely unaddressed.
We conducted a cross-sectional study combining active (household-based survey) and passive case finding (health services-based survey) to determine the burden and clinical epidemiology of wounds within the Taabo Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in rural Côte d’Ivoire. Patients identified were invited to participate in the wound management study simultaneously carried out in the survey area.
We surveyed approximately 4000 HDSS-registered persons and found a high overall wound prevalence (13.0%), predominately in children. Mechanical trauma was the leading cause, followed by furuncles, burns and Buruli ulcer. Most wounds were acute and had a size of less than 5 cm2, but a substantial proportion was large, complicated, or chronic, some of the latter persisting neglected for years.
The HDSS-based survey with combined active and passive case finding adopted in this study provides a better estimate than school- and health institution-based surveys which underestimate the frequency of skin wounds and, particularly, of neglected tropical diseases of the skin, such as Buruli ulcer and yaws. A comparison with country-specific WHO data suggests underreporting of Buruli ulcer cases.
