This study describes the presentation of individuals with leprosy in a non-endemic setting. They came from 34 leprosy endemic countries to the United Kingdom where they were diagnosed with leprosy. Most patients were young adults and male. The number of individuals from a leprosy endemic country reflect both the leprosy prevalence and the migration rates to the United Kingdom. The highest numbers of affected individuals in our cohort were from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Brazil, and Nigeria. The diagnosis was delayed in many patients and needed to be made by specialists. Patients were treated with World Health Organization recommended multi-drug regimens of rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine and/or rifampicin, ofloxacin and minocycline. Clinicians in non-endemic settings need to develop and maintain skills in suspecting and diagnosing leprosy. Dedicated services are needed to provide the specialist care individuals affected by leprosy require.
