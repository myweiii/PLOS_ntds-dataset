Wounds are a neglected health problem in rural communities of low-income countries, mostly caused by trauma and ulcerative skin diseases including Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) and associated with systemic complications and disability. Rural communities have limited access to high quality health services-based wound care.
We conducted a prospective observational study on WHO recommendation-based wound management at three levels–community, health centre, district hospital—in a rural community of Côte d’Ivoire. The healthcare personnel were trained in wound identification and treatment. Patients with skin wounds of all causes identified actively in a house-to-house survey and passively in the health services in a defined area of a Health and Demographic Surveillance System were included in the study and followed-up longitudinally.
Most wounds could be treated with basic wound care in the community or at the health centre by local healthcare personnel and closed within 2 to 3 weeks. Few wounds required referral to the district hospital or specific treatment. The results of our study indicate that a community-centred wound management model based on WHO recommendations and focusing on early identification and treatment of all wounds independent of the cause has potential for broad implementation in low-income countries.
