Spiders of the genus Loxosceles are widely distributed around the world, and their bite may evolve to skin necrosis, a condition known as cutaneous loxoscelism. There is no consensus about the best treatment to avoid necrosis and ulceration. However, experimental studies suggest that the extent of the necrosis can be reduced by approximately 30% if antivenom is administered within the first 48 h after the venom injection. Therefore, we designed a study to follow patients diagnosed with loxoscelism, treated or not treated with antivenom, in order to assess the evolution of the cutaneous lesion. We observed that patients admitted earlier and receiving antivenom ≤ 48 h after the bite were less likely to develop necrosis, suggesting that antivenom administration has a protective effect, especially when administered promptly. Even the patients who received antivenom ≤ 60 h after the bite were less likely to develop a cutaneous ulcer.
