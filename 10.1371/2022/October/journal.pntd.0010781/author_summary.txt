Spotted fever group Rickettsia (SFGR) are Gram-negative intracellular bacteria that during early onset localize in blood vessel endothelium before disseminating in the bloodstream and lymph via lymphocytes and other non-endothelial cells. Morbidity and mortality vary by species, with fatality rates up to 37% of PCR-positive cases in Mexico (Rickettsia rickettsii), with outcomes dependent on patient access to healthcare. SFGR disproportionately affects those in impoverished communities worldwide, and presentation is often with nonspecific symptoms, making early diagnosis difficult. Advances in acute laboratory diagnostics are critical to improve timely confirmatory diagnosis and our understanding of disease progression. Clinical culture and isolation methodologies for SFGR are largely unchanged since the development of the shell vial technique in 1989. We validated an isolation method that utilizes small volumes of acute clinical sample and minimal culture manipulation by first determining best practices for sample preparation, sampling methodology, and timing of sampling. This optimization resulted in detection of low copy number inoculums as early as 2 days in both cellular monolayer and culture supernatant samples. Initial testing was done across multiple SFGRs to demonstrate that species with varying virulence can be isolated using similar parameters. This simplified, efficient method for SFGR isolation from clinical samples has the potential to compliment and improve diagnostic testing, reflex testing, isolate characterization, and research studies.
