Schistosomiasis affects millions of people living in low- and middle-income countries lacking safe access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Infection occurs through skin-contact with water containing schistosome cercariae which are released from the snail intermediate hosts. The disease is mainly controlled through drug treatment with praziquantel in humans, but reinfection is possible if contact with cercaria-contaminated water continues. Despite all the efforts that have been made, this disease remains a major public health problem in disease-endemic regions. The use of soap during water contact, as part of good hygiene practice, may be an effective complementary control method as it might reduce the penetration of schistosome cercariae into the skin, thereby reducing the likelihood of reinfection. We conducted a systematic review to summarise previous research into the efficacy of soap against schistosome cercariae, and to identify current knowledge gaps to inform future studies. The information gathered from this review can provide policymakers with preliminary scientific evidence (e.g. the soap types, soap amounts, exposure times that are needed) to further emphasise the importance of effective soap usage in reducing the spread of schistosomiasis.
