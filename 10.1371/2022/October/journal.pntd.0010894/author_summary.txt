CRISPR gene drives can propagate engineered traits in vectors, like mosquitoes, to curb transmission of infectious diseases. Here we explore whether gene drive technology can also be used in molluscs to control schistosomiasis, a debilitating neglected tropical disease requiring freshwater snails as intermediate hosts. Unlike mosquitoes, these snail species can reproduce by self-fertilization, which could disable gene drive inheritance. Despite this limitation, our mathematical model identifies conditions in which drive immunity in snails can spread and, when complemented with mass Praziquantel treatment, achieves sustained disease reduction. Modeling that integrates genetic designs with ecological conditions and public health interventions is critical to safely leverage a powerful technology like gene drive.
