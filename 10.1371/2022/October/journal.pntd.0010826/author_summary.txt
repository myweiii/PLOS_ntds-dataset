SARS-CoV-2 has spread fast worldwide, yet the first pandemic waves in LMICs looked weaker than mathematical models had predicted. Suggestions for this observed disparity include socio-demographic and geographic factors and immunological modulation caused by exposure to endemic parasite infections. In countries where parasitic diseases are widespread, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), residents may have been coinfected with COVID-19 and pre-existing parasitic diseases due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we performed a nation-level ecological analysis to describe trends in primary SARS-CoV-2 outcomes by country and investigate potential correlations between these outcomes and pre-existing parasitic diseases. Our results suggest that malaria prevalence is a crucial factor to explain variation in COVID-19 incidence at the national scale, with a substantial relationship persisting even when putative confounders were adjusted. While we note that causal inference cannot be proved owing to insufficient data and hidden confounders, this will aid in generating new hypotheses and identifying intervention strategies to reduce NTDs and malaria in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.
