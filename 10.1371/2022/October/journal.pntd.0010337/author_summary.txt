The pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by multiple surges of infection with a variety of outcomes. By December 2021, about 75.3% of the population of the state of Rio Grande do Norte in northeastern Brazil, had been fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and a decrease in case detection from a mean of 32% of positives to about 8% of cases tested. Nevertheless, with the introduction of the Omicron variant at the end of 2021, the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections reached its highest peak, with 75% of the suspected cases testing positive. Among the positive cases diagnosed in the Institute of Tropical Medicine between March 2020 to mid-February 2022 a total of 444 reinfections were identified; of which 62.3% (n = 277) occurred during the Omicron outbreak. Of the reinfection cases, nine were sequenced as part of genomic surveillance. Analysis showed that the reinfectionsâ€™ lineages belonged to BA.1 introduced multiple times into the region; whereas, the isolates from the first infection belonged to different lineages. Thus, our data suggest that the Omicron variant evades immunity from natural infection from any other SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as from the available vaccines, indicating the need for development of effective blocking vaccines.
