Dengue, a viral disease transmitted by infected Aedes mosquitoes, is a major public health concern globally. In addition to its increased incidence in recent years, dengue is also spreading to new geographical regions. Local environmental factors are known to modify the mosquito vector density that directly impacts dengue virus transmission. Understanding the influence of environmental factors (meteorological conditions and landscape features) on dengue epidemiology in local settings is important for focused dengue intervention. Here, by utilizing dengue incidence and remotely sensed environmental data from 2012â€“2019, we have assessed the role of environmental factors in driving dengue virus transmission in the city of Bhopal in Central India. During the study period, a 14.5 fold increase in dengue incidence was observed in Bhopal city, which is way higher than the 2.3 fold increase reported at the national level. The risk of dengue virus transmission was higher with higher temperature and absolute humidity. An increase in built-up area, a proxy for urbanization, was found to be another predictor of increased dengue incidence in Bhopal. These findings can provide a stepping-stone for the development of dengue prediction models and the identification of dengue hotspots in order to improve vector control of this disease in cities with similar environmental conditions.
