Diarrhoea accounts for over half a million deaths in children under five annually. It additionally contributes to childhood malnutrition as well as growth and development deficiencies, particularly in low-income countries. Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) causes diarrhoea that is often persistent and can also contribute to growth deficiencies in young children. EAEC is a neglected pathogen that is often resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Small molecules that block EAEC colonization may hold the key to interfering with EAEC disease without promoting antimicrobial resistance. We screened the Medicines for Malaria Ventures Pathogen Box for chemicals that can interfere with EAEC biofilm formation, a key colonization indicator. Our screen identified five biofilm-inhibiting molecules that did not interfere with bacterial viability and therefore are unlikely to exert strong pressure for resistance. Molecular biology and computational investigations point to the EAEC anti-aggregative protein, also known as dispersin, as a possible target for one of these hit molecules. Optimizing EAEC antibiofilm hits will create templates that can be employed for resolving EAEC diarrhoea and related infections.
