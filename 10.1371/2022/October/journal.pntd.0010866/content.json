    "Introduction": "Salmonella belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae and is a medically important pathogen for both humans and animals. Based on its surface antigenic composition, Salmonella is currently divided into more than 2600 serotypes [1]. However, 99% of human and animal infections are caused solely by one subspecies, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (S. enterica). S. enterica is estimated to cause more than 300,000 deaths annually [2,3], mostly in developing countries. According to their clinical manifestations and presentations, S. enterica has traditionally been divided into \u2018typhoidal serovars\u2019 and \u2018non-typhoidal serovars\u2019 [4,5]. For example, human host-restricted S. enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A) are the leading causes of systemic infections known as typhoid and paratyphoid fever [2], respectively. In contrast, broad host-ranged S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) generally induce self-limiting gastroenteritis in healthy individuals [6]. However, non-typhoidal serovars may become invasive when the host are infants, young children or immunocompromised adults, causing a life-threatening infection involving the bloodstream, meninges, and other normally sterile sites [7]. Invasive Non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease is a severe illness with a case fatality ratio of approximately 15%. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the iNTS is observed to be a particular threat [8\u201310], S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis were the most frequently isolated iNTS pathogens [8], accounting for more than 80%. Unfortunately, widespread antimicrobial resistance among iNTS isolates is threatening the effectiveness of amenable antibiotic treatments [11]. To date, vaccines are regarded as one of the most economical and effective ways to prevent salmonellosis.\nImmunity to Salmonella, induced by natural infection or vaccination, is serotype-specific [12]. In S. enterica serovar, this serotype specificity is largely determined by the O-antigen polysaccharide [13] or Vi capsule [14]. The Vi capsule is produced by S. Typhi, while the O-antigen is widely found in other S. enterica serovars. The O-antigen polysaccharide is the outermost part of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which is a structurally diverse polymer and repeats in a diverse range of numbers. The LPS is found exclusively in the outer leaflet of the Salmonella membrane [15]. Approximately 2\u00d7106 LPS molecules cover \u223c75% of the cell surface, thus resulting in a formidable barrier limiting the antibodies from accessing the bacterial surface [16]. Nowadays, the only licensed single antigen vaccine against Salmonella infections is rationally based on their surface polysaccharides, i.e., the Vi capsule [17] or Vi capsule glycoconjugate vaccines [18]. However, multi-valent strategies are being explored in clinical development. For example, a bivalent outer membrane vesicle approach, also referred to as Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA) [19], targets S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, and a trivalent glycoconjugate approach targets S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, and S. Typhi [20,21]. Both of them involve in O-antigens formulation. Consequently, an OAg-based vaccine covering the other frequently isolated strains (i.e., S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis) is predictably desirable.\nThanks to the research work of monoclonal antibodies against S. enterica serogroups A to E, the immunogenic properties of Salmonella O-antigen are now clear [22]. The non-specific O-epitopes 1 and 12 are mainly attributed to the O-antigen common trisaccharide backbone 2)-\u03b1-Man(1\u21924)-\u03b1-Rha-(1\u21923)-\u03b1-Gal-(1\u2192, which is shared by S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis [23]. However, the immunodominant serovar-specific O-epitopes are largely confined to the paratose (Par), abequose (Abe) and tyvelose (Tyv) side-branch sugars (Fig 1A), namely, O2 (S. Paratyphi A, serogroup A1, \u03b1-Par(1\u21923)Man), O4 (S. Typhimurium, serogroup B1, \u03b1-Abe(1\u21923)Man) and O9 (S. Enteritidis or S. Typhi, serogroup D1, \u03b1-Tyv(1\u21923)Man). Passive protection studies demonstrated that IgG or IgM directed against the O2, O4 or O9 O-epitopes played an important role in disease prevention [24]. Consequently, the O-antigenic characteristics of S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are hereafter referred to as O2, O4 and O9, rather than their full O-antigenic formulae.\n(A) Square brackets denoted a single O-unit repeat. The arrows represented the linkages with the linkage types and the glycosyltransferase (GT) indicated. Note that the S. Paratyphi A, S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium all share a common trisaccharide backbone. The side-branch sugar of group A1, B1 and D1 was Par, Abe and Tyv, respectively, creating epitopes O2, O4 and O9. Note that the O-antigen galactose can be variably glucosylated, creating epitopes O:12 and O:1. Further, S. Typhimurium can variably O-acetylate its abequose in the C-2 position, creating epitope O:5. (B) Gene responsible for each glycosidic linkage synthesis was indicated adjacent to each arrow. The CDP-Sugars synthesis pathways are all initiated from glucose-1-phosphate. The genes involved in each reaction step of pathways were shown alongside the arrows. Abbreviations: Abe, abequose; Tyv, tyvelose; D-Man, D-mannose; D-Gal, D-galactose; L-Rha, L-rhamnose.\nThe O-antigen gene cluster of S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are all located between the galF and gnd gene in the chromosome [25,26] (S1 Fig). The main differences among these gene clusters are the regions responsible for synthesizing the 3,6-dideoxyhexosyl side-branch sugars, and the side-branch sugars are transferred from CDP-sugar precursors by glycosyltransferase WbaV [27,28]. The CDP-sugars synthesis pathways are all initiated from glucose-1-phosphate but diverge after DdhD. CDP-abequose synthase (Abe) and CDP-paratose synthase (Prt) reduce the keto group at C-4 to give either the galactose stereochemistry for CDP-Abe or the glucose stereochemistry for CDP-Par. CDP-Par 2-epimerase (Tyv) is responsible for the synthesis of CDP-tyvelose [27] (Fig 1B). Meanwhile, the Wzx is a multi-transmembrane protein with enormous sequence diversity that flips oligosaccharide substrates with varying degrees of preference [29,30].\nPreviously, we and others have shown that the immunodominant O-epitope of one S. enterica strain could be converted to another via chromosomally genetic manipulation [31\u201333]. For example, the O4 O-serotype in S. Typhimurium could be converted into O9 of S. Enteritidis by replacing the gene abe with prt-tyvD1 without sacrificing its immunogenic properties [31,33]. Similarly, S. Typhimurium with abe-wzxB1-wbaVB1 gene replaced by prt-tyvA1-wzxA1-wbaVA1 from S. Paratyphi A could convert its original O4 O-serotype into O2 and still retained an excellent immunogenic property [32]. So, we later come up with an interesting question. Could it be possible to simultaneously express immunodominant O2, O4 and O9 O-epitopes in one strain?\nIn this study, we explored the possibility of exhibiting O2, O4 and O9 immunodominant O-serotypes simultaneously in S. enterica serovars. The O2 & O4 double O-serotypes phenotype could be easily achieved in either S. Paratyphi A or S. Typhimurium background. So did the O4 & O9 double O-serotypes phenotype in S. Enteritidis or S. Typhimurium background. However, we encountered difficulties in chromosomally co-expressing O2 & O4 & O9 triple O-epitopes, which suggested S. enterica serovars exhibited different preferences over CDP-Par, CDP-Abe and CDP-Tyv precursors. Unexpectedly, increasing the pool of CDP-Par precursor and the synthesis of WbaV glycosyltransferase and Wzx flippase in S. Typhimurium by plasmids overexpression system could result in an O2 & O4 & O9 triple O-serotypes phenotype. A series of live attenuated S. enterica vaccine candidates were designed and constructed to evaluate their potential cross-immune responses and cross-protections against wild-type S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. Our research highlights the strategy of manipulating bacteria surface polysaccharide epitopes to generate live attenuated vaccines offering multi-serotype protections.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nAll animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and regulations stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, which was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Southwest University (IACUC-20210525-02).\n\n\nBacteria, plasmids, and culture conditions\nThe bacteria and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. E. coli, S. enterica serovars and their derivatives were aerobically grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar. Allelic exchange in S. enterica serovars was achieved by sacB gene-based counter selection on LB agar plates that contained 10% sucrose with no sodium chloride added and incubated at 30\u00b0C [34]. When necessary, chloramphenicol was added at 25 \u03bcg/ml to select transconjugants. D-Alanine (D-Ala) (50 \u03bcg/ml) was added for the growth of \u0394alr \u0394dadB strains [35]. Diaminopimelic acid (DAP) was added at 50 \u03bcg/ml for the growth of \u0394asd mutant \u03c77213 [36]. In vitro growth rates of Salmonella strains were determined by optical density measurements.\n\n\nMolecular and genetic procedures\nMolecular biology techniques were performed following standard methods [37], and details regarding the primers used in this study are listed in the S1 Table. DNA concentration and purity were measured using a Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and DNA fragments were cyclized by Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) method [38].\nInsertion or deletion mutant strains construction. As antibiotic resistance is not permitted in live vaccine strains, sacB gene-based sucrose counter-selectable suicide vectors were used to construct unmarked insertion or deletion mutations in S. enterica serovars [34]. Take the construction of L001 (SA-ddhc::abe) as an example; the upstream and downstream homologous regions were amplified from S. Paratyphi A using primer pairs P11/P12 and P15/P16. The abe gene was amplified from S. Typhimurium using primer pairs P13/P14 and the suicide vector backbone was amplified from pRE112 using primer pairs P1/P2. After purification, these three fragments were cyclized by CPEC method, resulting in a new suicide plasmid pHY005 (112-ddhc::prtA1). The conjugational transfer of pHY005 to S. Paratyphi A was performed using the suicide vector donor strain \u03c77213 [39]. Transconjugants with the first homologous recombination event were selected on chloramphenicol agar without supplemental DAP. The positive clones were inoculated in fresh LB media without chloramphenicol addition. The second homologous recombination event, resulting in excision of the suicide vector from the S. Paratyphi A chromosome, was selected on 10% sucrose LB plates without sodium chloride and grown at 30\u00b0C. Successful gene insertion mutations were confirmed by PCR screening and DNA sequencing. Other insertion mutations are constructed following the same procedures. The insertion mutations constructed for this study are illustrated in S2 Fig, and the primer pairs used for each DNA fragment amplification were labeled accordingly. As for the crp and cya gene deletion mutations, the suicide plasmids 112-Dcrp and 112-Dcya were constructed previously [33]. The subsequent deletion mutation processes were similar to those described above for the insertion mutations. All successful gene deletion or insertion mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.\nRecombinant plasmids construction. Briefly, prt, tyv, wzx and wbaV genes were cloned from S. Paratyphi A or S. Enteritidis using the same primer pairs P19/P20. To distinguish them from each other, we added an \"A1\" suffix subscript after each gene cloned from S. Paratyphi A, as S. Paratyphi A belongs to S. enterica serogroup A1. Similarly, a \u201cD1\u201d suffix subscript was added to each gene cloned from S. Enteritidis, as S. Enteritidis belongs to S. enterica serogroup D1. Next, the vector backbone was cloned from pSC101-asd and p15a-dadB using the same primer pairs P17/P18, as these two plasmids all contained a Ptrc promoter-multiple cloning site (MCS)-5ST1T2 terminator cassette. After purification, the DNA fragment prtA1-tyvA1-wzxA1-wbaVA1 and the linearized pSC101-asd vector were cyclized by CPEC method, resulting in pSC101-asd-O2. Similarly, the DNA fragment prtD1-tyvD1-wzxD1-wbaVD1 and the linearized p15a-dadB vector were cyclized by CPEC method, resulting in p15a-dadB-O9.\n\n\nPhenotype characterization of mutant strains\nMutant strains phenotype evaluations included the LPS silver stain and western blot, slide agglutination test, P22 transduction studies, growth rates, motility test, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test of deoxycholate (DOC) and polymyxin B. These methods were all reported previously, and a complete description of all methods employed for these phenotype evaluations is provided in S1 Text.\n\n\nVirulence determination and colonization in mice\nSix-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Dashuo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). To determine the 50% lethality dose (LD50), bacteria were grown to OD600 of 0.8 to 0.9 and harvested by centrifugation at 3,452 \u00d7 g at room temperature. The centrifuged S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis or their derivatives were resuspended and adjusted to the appropriate OD600 value by buffered saline with gelatin (BSG) [40]. In contrast, the centrifuged S. Paratyphi A or its derivatives were resuspended and adjusted to the appropriate OD600 value by 10% hog gastric mucin (Sigma). Six mice per group were infected orally with 20 \u03bcl of BSG or intraperitoneally injected with 500 \u03bcl 10% hog gastric mucin containing various doses of bacteria, ranging from 1 \u00d7 104 CFU to 1 \u00d7 108 CFU. Mice were monitored for mortality or signs of significant morbidity daily. The LD50 was calculated using the method of Reed and Muench. To evaluate colonization, three mice per group were orally inoculated with 20 \u03bcl of BSG containing 1 \u00d7 109 CFU bacteria. On days 4 and 8 post-inoculation, Peyer\u2019s patches, spleen and liver samples were collected. Samples were homogenized, dilutions were plated onto MacConkey and LB agar to determine viable counts.\n\n\nVaccination and immune response measurement\nThirty mice per group were vaccinated orally on day 0 with 20 \u03bcl BSG containing approximately 1 \u00d7 109 CFU vaccine strains and boosted on day 14 with the same dose. Blood samples and vaginal secretions were collected from randomly selected twelve mice in each group on day 28 after the booster immunization. On day 35, mice in each group were randomly subdivided into three small subgroups; mice in each subgroup were challenged orally with 5 \u00d7 107 CFU of S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis or injected intraperitoneally with 1 \u00d7 104 CFU of S. Paratyphi A (~100 times the LD50) [40,41]. S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis LPS were purified as described previously [42] and used as coating antigens to measure the immune responses. IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies specific to S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis LPS in the serum or vaginal secretions were measured using the quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously [43]. Antibody concentrations were calculated based on absorbance values and the standard curve.\n\n\nSerum bactericidal activity assay\nThe serum bactericidal assay (SBA) was performed as previously described with a few modifications [44]. Briefly, log-phase cultures of S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 in LB broth. After centrifugation and resuspension, the log-phase cultures were diluted in PBS to a concentration of approximately 1\u00d7 104 CFU/ml. Sera samples from vaccinated mice were serially diluted from 1:100 to 128,000, and nonimmune sera were serially diluted from 1: 10 to 1,280. Optimal SBA results were achieved by combining 25 \u03bcl of active baby rabbit complement (BRC) (25% final concentration) with 15 \u03bcl of PBS, 50 \u03bcl of diluted mice pooled sera, and 10 \u03bcl of diluted bacteria (~350 CFU). In total, 10 \u03bcl of the mixture from each well was spread on LB agar plates after 60 min to assess the bactericidal activity. The spread LB agar plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, and the viable CFU were counted the next day. The negative control contained only bacteria and complement. The serum bactericidal antibody titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that produced >50% killing in relation to the killing observed for the control wells. The titers were determined from the mean bacterial count from triplicate wells.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (Graph Software, San Diego, CA) by one-way or two-way ANOVA of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparison post-test. Kaplan-Meier survival curve comparisons were calculated by comparing two groups at each time point through the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. The data were expressed as the means \u00b1 SD. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
    "Results": "S. enterica mutants exhibiting double or triple immunodominant O-serotypes\nThe primary goal of this study is to try to exhibit O2, O4 and O9 O-serotypes simultaneously in one S. enterica serovar. To begin with, we explore the possibility of co-expressing O2 & O4 or O4 & O9 O-epitopes first. According to the O-antigen gene cluster analysis (S1 Fig), the major difference among S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis lie in the genes responsible for the synthesis of the side-branch sugar (Fig 1B), i.e., the abe, prt and tyv genes for CD-Abe, CD-Par and CDP-Tyv biosynthesis respectively. Consequently, we inserted the abe gene from S. Typhimurium between the ddhc and prt gene of S. Paratyphi A to test the potential of co-expressing O2 and O4 O-epitopes (S2A Fig). The results of bacterial agglutination (Table 2) and western blot (Fig 2A) showed that the SA-ddhc::abe mutant could react positively to O2 and O4 antisera, respectively, indicating the co-existence of O2 and O4 O-epitopes in the outer membrane of SA-ddhc::abe mutant. To be more persuasive, we inserted the prtA1 gene from S. Paratyphi A similarly between the ddhc and abe gene of S. Typhimurium (S2B Fig) to see if these co-expressing phenomena still existed. Consistently, the bacterial agglutination (Table 2) and western blot results (Fig 2A) all indicated that the ST-ddhc::prtA1 mutant exhibited O2 and O4 O-epitopes simultaneously. At the same time, the abe gene was inserted between the ddhc and prtD1 gene of S. Enteritidis (S2C Fig) and the prtD1-tvyD1 gene was inserted between the ddhc and abe gene of S. Typhimurium (S2D Fig). Unsurprisingly, either SE-ddhc::abe or ST-ddhc::prtD1-tyvD1 could independently agglutinate with O4 and O9 antisera obviously (Table 2). However, we did not observe clear anti-O9 positive bands of SE-ddhc::abe or clear anti-O4 positive bands of ST-ddhc::prtD1-tyvD1 in western blot results (Fig 2B). Unfortunately, we failed to obtain a S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis mutant that could express O2, O4 and O9 O-epitopes simultaneously through chromosomally genetic modifications.\nLPS was extracted from the S. enterica mutants exhibiting O2&O4 (A), O4&O9 (B) and O2&O4&O9 (C) O-serotypes and separated on a 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel by tricine-SDS-PAGE. Samples were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting with anti-Par O2, anti-Abe O4 or anti-Tyv O9 antisera. The detected bands corresponded to LPS with different side-branch O-unit repeats.\nWe have noticed that S. Enteritidis possess both functional prt and tyv genes and it turns out to be a dominant O9 O-serotype, while the tyv gene in S. Paratyphi A is frameshift and yet it turns out be a dominant O2 O-serotype. So, we speculate that when prt and tyv are co-expressed at a similar level, the CDP-Par will be mostly converted into CDP-Tyv, resulting in an O9 dominant O-serotype. Therefore, we hypothesize that it might be possible to express O2, O4 and O9 O-epitopes simultaneously by improving the CDP-Par substrate pool. Based on that assumption, we have built a dual-plasmid expression system. The ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd mutant was constructed deliberately to harbor pSC101-asd and p15a-dadB plasmids without antibiotic selection pressure [35]. The prtA1-tyvA1-wbaVA1-wzxA1 genes from S. Paratyphi A were cloned into pSC101-asd, resulting in pSC101-asd-O2, and the prtD1-tyvD1-wbaVD1-wzxD1 genes from S. Enteritidis were cloned into p15a-dadB, resulting in p15a-dadB-O9. As tyvA1 possesses a loss-of-function mutation, when pSC101-asd-O2 and p15a-dadB-O9 were transferred into ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd, the prt gene were comparatively overexpressed. Except for anti-O9, we did not observe anti-O2 or anti-O4 positive bands of ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB-O9) in western blot results (Fig 2C). However, the bacterial agglutination assays had clearly shown that, in addition to O4 antiserum, ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd harboring pSC101-asd-O2 or p15a-dadB-O9 could agglutinate with O2 or O9 antiserum, respectively (Table 2). Most importantly, ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB-O9) could agglutinate with O2, O4 and O9 antisera independently, which indicated that we had successfully exhibited O2, O4 and O9 O-serotypes simultaneously in S. Typhimurium outer membrane.\n\n\nPhenotype characterizations of S. enterica mutants\nAs we have achieved double or triple immunodominant O-epitopes co-expression in S. enterica mutants, we would like to know whether or not these O-serotypes\u2019 co-existence would influence their phenotype characterizations. Firstly, the LPS profiles of these mutant strains were visualized by silver staining. Most mutants can synthesize a full length of LPS when compared with their wild-type parent strains, except for ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB), which exhibited a decrease in LPS synthesis (Fig 3). Next, the accessibilities of mutants\u2019 O-antigen structure for Phage P22 were examined. The number of transductions obtained from double or triple O-serotypes exhibiting mutants was similar to that of their wild-type parent strains (Table 3), indicating that their O-antigen backbones were unaffected. Secondly, the growth rate of these mutant strains and their wild-type parent strains were all evaluated, and there was no significant difference between them (Fig 4).\nS. enterica mutants exhibiting double or triple immunodominant O-serotypes were constructed by chromosomally gene insertion mutations (A) or plasmid overexpressing systems (B). The LPS extracted from these mutant strains was separated on a 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel by tricine-SDS-PAGE and visualized by the silver staining. Bands represented the LPS with different numbers of O-unit repeats.\nIn vitro growth rates of S. enterica and its derivatives were measured by optical density measurements as an OD600 value at multiple time points.\nMeanwhile, their sensitivity to the bile salt DOC and the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B were tested. The DOC MICs had no difference among these strains, whereas the polymyxin B MICs for double or triple O-epitopes co-expressing mutant strains were twofold lower than their wild-type parent strains. All mutants retained similar swimming motility as their wild type parent strains (Table 3). Taken together, all these results indicated that double or triple O-epitopes co-expressing had a minor influence on the phenotype changes of our constructed S. enterica mutants.\n\n\nVirulence and colonization of the S. enterica mutants in BALB/c mice\nThe LD50 values of wild-type S. Typhimurium S100 and S. Enteritidis S246 were approximately 105 CFU, whereas the LD50 values of double or triple O-epitopes co-expressing mutant strains were approximately 106 or 107 CFU, showing around 10 times or 100 times attenuation (Table 3). Since S. Paratyphi A is a human host-restricted pathogen, its virulence attribute was evaluated in a lethal murine model that requires suspending the bacteria in 5\u201310% hog gastric mucin and then injecting the suspension intraperitoneally [45]. In this model, the LD50 value of wild-type S. Paratyphi A was approximately 100 CFU, showing a highly virulent attribute.\nConsidering the phenotype characterizations and broad host adaption abilities, we select ST-ddhc::prtA1, SE-ddhc::abe and ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB-O9) for further potential live attenuated vaccine candidates development. To guarantee their safety in the murine model, we further deleted the cya and crp global regulators of these mutant strains [46], resulting in L008 (ST-ddhc::prtA1 \u0394cya \u0394crp), L009 (SE-ddhc::abe \u0394cya \u0394crp) and L083 [ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394cya \u0394crp \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB-O9)], respectively. Again, their O-serotype phenotypes have been reconfirmed, and the deletion mutations of cya and crp genes did not affect the O-epitopes expression (S3 Fig) but could attenuate these candidates more than 1000 times (LD50 > 5 \u00d7108 CFU). To be more briefly, these mutant strains will be hereafter referred to as L008 (O2&O4), L009 (O4&O9) and L083 (O2&O4&O9). The colonization of L008 (O2&O4), L009 (O4&O9) and L083 (O2&O4&O9) in murine Peyer\u2019s patches, spleens, and livers was determined on days 4 and 8 after oral inoculation. All candidates displayed good colonization in Peyer\u2019s patches, livers, and spleens. No deaths occurred during this period (Fig 5).\nColonization of mouse Peyer\u2019s patches (A), livers (B) and spleens (C) 4 and 8 days post-inoculation were shown. The horizontal lines represent the means, and the error bars represent the standard deviation of the means.\n\n\nImmune responses induced by live attenuated S. enterica vaccines\nTo assess the immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates, mice were inoculated orally with approximately 109 CFU of each strain on day 0 and boosted on day 14 with the same doses. Anti-S. Paratyphi A, anti-S. Enteritidis and anti-S. Typhimurium LPS serum antibodies were measured on day 28.\nThe IgG immune response are depicted in Fig 6. Mice vaccinated with L008 (O2&O4) and L083 (O2&O4&O9) mounted a significantly higher anti-S. Paratyphi A LPS immune responses than those of ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya or SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya. Similarly, mice vaccinated with SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya, L009 (O4&O9) and L083 (O2&O4&O9) mounted a significantly higher anti-S. Enteritidis LPS immune responses than those of ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya. Except for SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya, mice vaccinated with other vaccine candidates could all mount a significantly higher anti-S. Typhimurium LPS responses. We did observe some cross-immunogenicity between ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya and SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya, but it had long been proved to be the common trisaccharide backbone and the conserved core oligosaccharide. So far, we did not obtain valid evidence showing that there were detectable cross-immune responses among immunodominant O2, O4 and O9 O-epitopes unless they were co-expressed simultaneously. L008 (O2&O4) could mount a significantly higher anti-S. Paratyphi A LPS immune response than those vaccinated with ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O4), showing an improved cross-immune response against S. Paratyphi A. Consistently, L009 (O4&O9) could mount a significantly higher anti-S. Typhimurium LPS immune response than those vaccinated with SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O9), showing an improved cross-immune response against S. Typhimurium. Most importantly, L083 (O2&O4&O9) could simultaneously mount a significantly higher anti-S. Paratyphi A and anti-S. Enteritidis LPS immune response than those vaccinated with ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O4), showing a good sign of eliciting cross-protections against S. Paratyphi A and S. Enteritidis. Meanwhile, all vaccine candidates induced a significantly higher IgG2a response than IgG1 (S4 Fig), indicating a predominantly Th1-type response.\n(A) Anti-S. Paratyphi A LPS serum IgG levels.

Responses that differed from the results in the SE-\u0394cya \u0394crp group are noted by asterisks (**, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001). Antibody concentrations were calculated using a standard curve and all the measured sample concentrations were within the standard curve range. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the means calculated by GraphPad Prism software. These data are representative of at least two independent experiments.\nWe also evaluated the serum IgM (S5 Fig) and vaginal washes IgA antibodies immune responses (S6 Fig). A similar trend of IgM and IgA immune responses has been observed compared to IgG antibodies. Unsurprisingly, L008 (O2&O4), L009 (O4&O9) and L083 (O2&O4&O9) could induce a significantly higher amount of cross-reactive IgM antibodies than their parent strains. However, the elicited IgM antibodies were even higher than their IgG counterpart, which is unexpected. A significantly higher level of secreted IgA antibodies against S. Paratyphi A and S. Enteritidis were observed in mice vaccinated by L083 (O2&O4&O9) when compared to its parent strain ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya. However, L009 (O4&O9) could elicit a higher level of anti-S. Enteritidis LPS IgA compared to L083 (O2&O4&O9) and the level of anti-S. Paratyphi A LPS IgA was similar between L008 (O2&O4) and L083 (O2&O4&O9). Negative control groups did not mount a detectable immune response. All these ELISA results had shown that our vaccine candidates could induce promising cross-immune responses.\n\n\nAntibody-dependent complement-mediated S. enterica killing\nTo evaluate the functional capacities of antibodies induced by our vaccine candidates, we performed the serum bactericidal assays (SBAs) using pooled serum from immunized mice or BSG control. Baby rabbit complement titration with serum samples from immunized mice had a significantly higher complement-mediated killing activity versus those from nonimmunized mice (Fig 7). The serum antibodies induced by ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O4) or SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O9) exhibited a high level of SBA activity against its homologous serotype strains. However, they had a limited SBA activity against heterologous serotype strains. On the contrary, the serum antibodies induced by L008 (O2&O4) and L009 (O4&O9) significantly improved SBA activity against heterologous serotype strains S. Paratyphi A and S. Typhimurium, respectively. More importantly, the bactericidal abilities induced by L083 (O2&O4&O9) covered all tested heterologous serotype strains, significantly improving SBA activity against S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Typhimurium, simultaneously.\nSerum bactericidal assays (SBA) were performed with vaccinated mouse serum from the indicated groups against wild-type S. Paratyphi A (A), S. Enteritidis (B) and S. Typhimurium (C). Strains were grown in LB to log phase (OD600, 0.4). The error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean titers calculated by GraphPad Prism software. The dashed lines indicate the detection limit of the assay. **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001.\n\n\nProtective efficacy of live attenuated S. enterica vaccines against wild-type S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis\nThe immune protection against wild-type S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis were evaluated in the murine model (Fig 8). Unfortunately, most of the vaccinated mice succumbed to the 100 times LD50 challenge from S. Paratyphi A. Only three mice, one out of twelve in L008 (O2&O4) and two out of twelve in L083 (O2&O4&O9) vaccinated group, survived in the end. However, mice vaccinated by L008 (O2&O4) and L083 (O2&O4&O9) could generally survive as long as 4 days, while the other vaccinated groups could barely survive a single day, showing a positive correlation of cross-protection. Meanwhile, mice vaccinated by ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O4) or SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O9) could survive a 100 times LD50 challenge from S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis, respectively, indicating a high level of homologous protection. However, these mice succumbed to the heterogenous challenge. Intriguingly, mice vaccinated by L009 (O4&O9) could independently survive a 100 times LD50 challenge from S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis, indicating a good cross-protection against heterogenous challenge. Similar results were also observed in mice vaccinated by L083 (O2&O4&O9). These mice could independently survive a 100 times LD50 challenge from S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. Taken together, our vaccine confidants possessed good abilities to elicit cross-immune responses and cross-protections.\nFive weeks after primary immunization, nine to twelve mice from each group were challenged orally or intraperitoneally with approximately 100 times the LD50 of the wild-type virulent S. Typhimurium (A), S. Enteritidis (B) and S. Paratyphi A (C). Curve comparisons were calculated using GraphPad Prism by comparing two groups by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test for all the marked groups versus the PBS group. ***, P<0.001. The numbers in brackets represented the number of mice alive at the end of the experiment/number of mice challenged.",
    "Discussion": "Traditionally, Salmonella vaccine developments followed the strategies of targeting one particular serovar or serotype, leaving the cross-protection largely unexplored. However, recently, a bivalent outer membrane vesicle (GMMAs) approach targeting S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium [19] and a trivalent glycoconjugate approach targeting S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, and S. Typhi [21] are showing the light of multi-valent strategies. In this study, we explored another way of improving the cross-protections against S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis by O-antigen O-epitopes rational design.\nThe antisera of patients who recovered from paratyphoid fever or iNTS diseases mainly target the O-antigen polysaccharides of S. enterica serovars, indicating the importance of anti-OAg antibodies in patients\u2019 adaptive immune responses. The O-serotype specificity of S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis is determined by the 3,6-dideoxyhexosyl side-branch residues of the trisaccharide backbone (Figs 1 and S1) [22]. Therefore, our strategy was to exhibit double or triple immunodominant O-serotypes in one S. enterica serovar. In order to achieve that goal, we first explored the possibility of co-expression of two O-epitopes. As the results had shown, either inserting the abe gene in front of the prtA1 gene in S. Paratyphi A (SA-ddhc::abe) or the prtA1 gene in front of the abe gene in S. Typhimurium (ST-ddhc::prtA1) (S2 Fig), we all get an obviously bacterial agglutination with O2 and O4 antisera (Table 2). Consistently, positive bands were observed in the western blot assays when using O2 and O4 antisera as the primary antibody (Fig 2A). These data all indicated that O2 and O4 could be simultaneously expressed in either S. Paratyphi A or S. Typhimurium background. Similarly, we inserted the abe gene in front of the prtD1 gene in S. Enteritidis (SE-ddhc::abe), and the prtD1 gene in front of the abe gene in S. Typhimurium (ST-ddhc::prtD1-tyvD1) to testify the possibility of O4 and O9 O-serotypes exhibition (S2 Fig). We observed a clear bacterial agglutination with O4 and O9 antisera in both SE-ddhc::abe and ST-ddhc::prtD1-tyvD1 (Table 2). However, the western blot assay did not show anti-O9 positive bands in SE-ddhc::abe sample or anti-O4 positive bands in ST-ddhc::prtD1-tyvD1 sample (Fig 2B). The possible explanation for this might be the unbalanced expression of O4 and O9 O-epitopes, as this phenomenon has already existed naturally in wild-type S. Enteritidis. In wild-type S. Enteritidis or S. Typhi, the CDP-Par and CDP-Tyv synthesize at a similar level. However, the immunodominant O-serotype of S. Enteritidis or S. Typhi is exclusively O9, with even undetectable bacterial agglutination to O2 antiserum. On the other hand, S. Paratyphi A exhibiting O2 O-serotype is due to the frameshift mutation in tyv gene [47], interrupting the synthesis of CDP-Tyv from CDP-Par, leaving the S. Paratyphi A with no choice but utilizing the CDP-Par as its substrate for side-branch sugar attachment. Lastly, we failed to express O2, O4 and O9 O-serotypes in either S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis strain by chromosomally genetic modification.\nIt seems that S. enterica serovars have a different preference for the CDP-Abe, CDP-Par and CDP-Tyv substrates when they are synthesized at a similarly level. At least, it is evident that S. enterica prefers CDP-Tyv rather than CDP-Par [28]. Therefore, we hypothesized that achieving an O2, O4 and O9 O-serotype phenotype might be possible by increasing the synthesis of CDP-Par. So, we built a dual-plasmid expression system in a S. Typhimurium mutant, i.e., ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd or p15a-dadB). As the WbaV glycosyltransferase and Wzx flippase might have influenced synthesizing and transferring of different side-branch O-units, we amplified the whole prtA1-tyvA1-wbaVA1-wzxA1 genes from S. Paratyphi A and inserted them into pSC101-asd vector, resulting in pSC101-asd-O2 in brief (S2 Fig). At the same time, we amplified the whole prtD1-tyvD1-wbaVD1-wzxD1 genes from S. Enteritidis and inserted them into p15a-dadB vector, resulting in p15a-dadB-O9 in brief. Predictably, ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd harboring both pSC101-asd-O2 and p15a-dadB-O9 would increase CDP-Par synthesis, as there are at least two copies of prt gene transcribing but with only one normal tyv gene. Meanwhile, the synthesis of CDP-Abe was unaffected. The bacterial agglutination assays demonstrated that ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB-O9) could agglutinate with O2, O4 and O9 antiserum individually, indicating that we had successfully achieved a triple immunodominant O-serotypes phenotype in S. Typhimurium background (Table 2). However, we did not receive a consistent result from western blot assays, which showed a predominantly anti-O9 positive band (Fig 2C). This inconsistency between the bacterial agglutination and western blot assay might indicate the amount or distribution of O2, O4 and O9 O-epitopes in ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB-O9) is most likely unequal or unbalanced. We could not explain clearly how these O-epitopes are arranged in the outer membrane, either homogeneously or heterogeneously attached to each of the O-antigen polysaccharides (S7 Fig), or merely mixed irregularity. It is also possible that new irrelevant epitopes are created and, in this case, a portion of the antibody response may not be functional.\nLiu etc. had shown that the glycosyltransferase WbaV of S. enterica is in fact more effective in attaching the Tyv to the O-antigen common trisaccharide backbone than Par, and this inefficiency of low Par utilization could be primarily improved by overexpressing the wbaV gene [28]. Their findings were reconfirmed in this study. Meanwhile, Hong etc. had also shown that the Wzx flippases have a strong preference for their cognate substrate [29,30]. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the absence of the side-branch resides would dramatically decrease the efficiency of Wzx flippases [29]. However, no direct evidence had been put forward to illustrate the influence of different side-branch resides upon Wzx translocation efficiency. Our previous report demonstrated that the S. Typhimurium could tolerate well Tyv side-branch O-units but reject Par side-branch O-units [32], indicating that nonnative substrate does influence Wzx translocation efficiency. However, in this study, we further developed these theories by showing that S. Typhimurium did not exhibit severe rejection against CDP-Par if accompanied by CDP-Abe. Moreover, S. Typhimurium could utilize CDP-Par as its side-branch building block even in the presence of CDP-Tyv.\nAfter successfully constructing a series of double or triple immunodominant O-serotype mutant strains, we would like to know their phenotype characterizations. The phage P22 tailspike protein recognizes and hydrolyzes the repetitive O-antigen polysaccharides of S. enterica serogroup A, B and D at the Rha-Gal (1\u21923)-glycosidic linkages during infections [48]. So, we first performed a P22 phage transduction assay to check the O-antigen integrality of our mutant strains. The transduction numbers of our constructed mutants were similar to their wild-type parent strains (Table 3), which indicated that our insertion mutations did not change the essential common trisaccharide backbone of O-antigen polysaccharides. Next, the LPS profile of each mutant strain was examined. It is obvious that ST-ddhc::prtA1 and SE-ddhc::abe mutants could exhibit a full length of LPS (Fig 3A), while ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB) or ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd, p15a-dadB-O9) showed a decreased synthesis of LPS length (Fig 3B). Surprisingly, ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB-O9) exhibited a full length of LPS synthesis, indicating a higher level of CDP-Par synthesis might be the critical factor in achieving a triple O-serotype phenotype in a S. enterica strain. However, this assumption is not strictly demonstrated in this study. Meanwhile, we also conducted other phenotype evaluation assays (Table 3), such as the DOC and polymyxin B MICs, to roughly mimic the intestinal environment of the natural oral infection route and swimming abilities, an indicator of bacteria surface \u201cwettability\u201d [49]. After all these tests, we selected ST-ddhc::prtA1, SE-ddhc::abe and ST-\u0394alr \u0394dadB \u0394recF \u0394asd (pSC101-asd-O2, p15a-dadB-O9) for further cross-immunogenicity evaluation. To guarantee their safety in the murine model, the global regulator cya and crp were deleted in these mutant strains [50], resulting in a series of potential vaccine candidates. The vaccine candidates showed good colonization in Peyer\u2019s patches, livers, and spleens (Fig 5).\nWe are primarily interested in whether or not our live attenuated vaccine candidates could elicit effective cross-immune responses. To evaluate that, we applied ELISA assays to detect the antibodies raised against the O-antigen polysaccharides of wild-type S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis (Fig 6). Consistent with the bacterial agglutination assays, L008 (O2&O4) could induce a significantly higher anti-O2 antibody response than ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O4). Meanwhile, L009 (O4&O9) could induce a significantly higher anti-O4 antibody response than SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O9). Most importantly, L083 (O2&O4&O9) could simultaneously induce significantly higher anti-O2, anti-O4 and anti-O9 antibody responses in mice when compared to the negative control, SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O9) and ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O4), respectively. These data showed that our vaccine candidates could elicit effective cross-immune responses. Although a high level of anti-S. Typhimurium, anti-S. Enteritidis and anti-S. Paratyphi A LPS serum antibodies were obtained, we would like to know whether or not these raised antibodies are indeed functional. The in vitro bactericidal data indicated that serum complement-mediated S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis killing depended upon anti-O2, anti-O4 and anti-O9 antibodies (Fig 7). Moreover, we challenged all vaccinated mice with wild-type virulent S. Paratyphi A, S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis strain (Fig 8). Compared with the negative control, ST-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O4) and SE-\u0394crp \u0394cya (O9) vaccinated mice could receive good homologous protection but failed to heterologous challenge. However, mice vaccinated by double or triple O-epitopes vaccine strains received a significantly higher protection rate even when challenged with heterologous wild-type virulent strains, showing adequate cross-immunity protection.\nHowever, there are some limitations to this study. The S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis used in SBA assay are all animal isolates, which could not simply be equal to the human blood isolates. Other reports have shown that anti-LPS antibodies stimulate low complement-dependent killing against S. Enteritidis human blood isolates [51]. Furthermore, S. Typhimurium ST313, which dominates in sub-Saharan Africa, is highly serum resistant and expresses distinct transcriptional patterns that may aid in escaping this killing mechanism [52]. It is a good future research direction to illustrate how they escape this complement-dependent killing mechanism.\nIn summary, we expressed double or triple immunodominant O-epitopes in a S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis background strain and proved they are effective in inducing cross-immunity and cross-protection. Significantly, the strategies we present in this study are not limited to S. enterica O-antigen polysaccharides but have applicability for generating cross-protection for many other important human and animal pathogens. Notable examples include Shigella flexneri and many pathogenic Escherichia coli."
