Soil-transmitted helminths include hookworms, threadworms, whipworms and roundworms. These worms may infect different hosts including humans and dogs, and some species are zoonotic, meaning that they are able to transmit between animals and humans. In many Australian Indigenous communities, people remain infected with these worms at high rates compared to other parts of the country despite various control strategies. Resource and health literacy inequalities are primary drivers for these differences. However, the potential for dogs to act as reservoirs for zoonotic worm infections in humans must also be considered. For this reason, itâ€™s important to create a clear picture of the level of infection by location and host. Given that tests used to establish prevalence can produce false positive or negative results, we performed a meta-analysis allowing comparison of true prevalence estimates by location and host, regardless of the test used. This review suggests that threadworm and dog hookworm remain endemic in Australian Indigenous communities, though a gap exists to accurately inform the prevalence of the other worms. It also highlights the need for One Health strategies in research, policy and control where humans, all animal hosts and the environment are considered in a culturally relevant way.
