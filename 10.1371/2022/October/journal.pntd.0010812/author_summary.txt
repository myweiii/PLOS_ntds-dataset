Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a mosquito-borne illness and has potential result in severe birth effects. Currently, ZIKV is still causing an unprecedented ongoing epidemic in Latin America and threatening North America and potentially the rest of the world. This is the first study to assess the global landscape, long-term trends and regional differences in the incidence of ZIKV infection using the data from Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019, including the description of ZIKV infection episodes by different sex and by different year group, as well as the relationship between international travellers and imported ZIKV cases. Our study can not only serve as complement to previous studies, but also provide a more comprehensive perspective of global ZIKV infection prevention strategies.
