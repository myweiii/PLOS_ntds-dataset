The larva of the tapeworm E. multilocularis grows tumor-like within the host liver, thus causing the lethal disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE). Anti-parasitic treatment relies on chemotherapy with benzimidazoles, which do not kill the parasite and must be applied for years. As druggable enzymes with key functions in growth control, protein kinases are promising drug targets and many kinase inhibitors have been identified during cancer research. Optimized for binding to human kinases, however, repurposing of such drugs for parasitic disease treatment is associated with adverse side effects. Herein, the authors applied an in silico approach to identify small molecule compounds that show higher specificity for a parasite kinase, EmPim, over its mammalian homologs. The authors demonstrate expression of EmPim in Echinococcus stem cells, which are the drivers of parasite growth, and show that mammalian PIM kinase inhibitors SGI-1776 and CX-6258 also affect parasite development in vitro. Finally, they show that one of the in silico screened compounds is equally effective against the parasite as SGI-1776 and CX-6258, but significantly less toxic to human cells. These results demonstrate the utility of in silico approaches to identify parasite-specific kinase inhibitors.
