    "Abstract": "Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by the metacestodes of Echinococcus spp. The disease has a long latent period and is largely underdiagnosed, partially because of the lack of effective early diagnostic approaches. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we profiled the serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) of E. multilocularis-infected mice and identified three parasite-origin proteins, thioredoxin peroxidase 1 (TPx-1), transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (TER ATPase), and 14-3-3, being continuously released by the parasites into the sera during the infection via EVs. Using ELISA, both TPx-1 and TER ATPase were shown to have a good performance in diagnosis of experimental murine echinococcosis as early as 10 days post infection and of human echinococcosis compared with that of control. Moreover, TER ATPase and TPx-1 were further demonstrated to be suitable for evaluation of the prognosis of patients with treatment. The present study discovers the potential of TER ATPase and TPx-1 as promising diagnostic candidates for echinococcosis."
