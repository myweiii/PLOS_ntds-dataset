Arboviruses are transmitted to humans by infected arthropods mostly mosquitoes, many of which lay their eggs in containers with standing water in our homes. Dengue and Zika are some of the examples of these viruses that are responsible for affecting many people in big cities every year. The illnesses can cause fever, malaise, and red patches on the skin that may or may not itch. This study aimed to investigate whether people with red patches on their skin had these diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, in Manaus, Brazil. In addition, we investigated whether they were ill from other causes, as several other illnesses can also cause red patches on the skin. The exams were carried out on 340 people, men and women over 18 years of age. It was identified that 231 people were sick from arboviruses, 227 of which were sick from Zika, 3 from dengue and 1 from chikungunya. Other causes of red spots were also identified, as was the case of sexually transmitted infections syphilis and HIV, with two and three positive cases for each disease, respectively. In addition, some cases of diseases such and measles, which are transmitted by sneezing or coughing, have been identified.
