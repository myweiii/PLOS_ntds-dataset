Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with blood flukes, which leads to acute and chronic pathology in millions of infected individuals, particularly those within the poorest tropical and subtropical regions. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) set the ambitious goals to achieve Elimination of Schistosomiasis as a Public Health Problem (i.e., EPHP, prevalence of heavy infection intensity less than 1% in all sentinel sites) and complete Interruption of Transmission (i.e., IoT reduction of incidence of infection to zero) in selected African regions by 2025. More recently, the revised WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD)-Roadmap and Schistosomiasis Control and Elimination Guidelines aim to achieve EPHP in all regions by 2030. Here we analysed population genetic data associated with a recent 5-year cluster-randomized trial across Zanzibar (Pemba and Unguja islands) aimed to assess the impact of contrasting interventions to achieve urogenital schistosomiasis elimination. Whilst, consistent with the main trial study, no significant differential impact of interventions on parasite prevalence or intensity was detected, our data suggested that the greatest impact on genetic diversity was within the mass drug administration plus concurrent mollusciding arm. Moreover, analyses revealed significant differences in both the genetic sub-structuring and notably the fecundity of parasites between Pemba and Unguja islands, and within island in relation to some (but not all) persistent hotspots, potentially indicative of genetic and biological factors driving persistence. These findings highlight the important contribution of population genetic analyses to reveal high levels of genetic diversity, biological drivers and potential gene-environmental interactions, in determining infection dynamics and persistence, all of which may serve to limit the impact of differential disease control activities.
