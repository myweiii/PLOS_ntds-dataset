Zoonoses impact humans and animals in several ways. Unfortunately, the burden of zoonoses is usually not characterized and quantified through integrated human and animal metrics. Our study is the first systematic review to assess the dual burden of zoonotic diseases in humans and animals globally. In the considered set of human and animal burden of zoonoses, the zDALY due to animal disease varied from 0.005% to 91%. Therefore, metrics encompassing both burdens are likely to change decision-making regarding the prevention and control of zoonoses. Implementing a “One Health” approach will require the application of such metrics. We believe that quantification of the dual burden of the diseases is a key to improving zoonosis prioritization decision-making, and resource allocation. This study outlines the need for integrated studies on zoonoses and reporting of data with a comparable metric.
