Mass drug administration using praziquantel against Schistosoma haematobium, the causative agent of urogenital schistosomiasis, is the main intervention measure in Tanzania and single annual rounds of MDA has been implemented consecutively for 15 years in north-western part of the country. Therefore, it is highly recommended to assess the current status of S. haematobium infection in these areas. Re-assessment will help to identify remaining pockets of the disease and geographical location of at-risk population. This will allow data-driven improvements of MDA strategies in areas remaining with high prevalence, distribution of the limited available drugs and funds to support preventive mass chemotherapy. This study determined the prevalence and S. haematobium intensity of infections after 15 years of mass preventive chemotherapy. Furthermore, the study assessed the performance of urine reagent strip at this time when the infection prevalence and intensities have declined following mass treatment. Overall, comparing with the baseline prevalence prior to initiation of countrywide mass preventive chemotherapy in 2005/06, though not uniformly, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection have significantly declined in all the four-study district. However, some pockets of infections remain in some of the districts. In addition, even after 15 years of intensive preventive mass chemotherapy, the performance of urine reagent strips is acceptable and can continue to be used for rapid assessment and monitoring the impact of mass preventive chemotherapy on S. haematobium infection.
