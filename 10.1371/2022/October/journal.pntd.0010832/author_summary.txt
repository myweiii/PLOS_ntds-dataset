The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) was developed for the identification and treatment of major childhood illnesses based on a syndromic approach that can be applied by local health care workers in rural health facilities. Dengue represents an important differential diagnosis for children and adolescents with acute febrile illness in Southeast Asia but is not officially included in the fever module of IMCI. Local adaptations in different countries, however, have integrated dengue into their guidelines. We analysed the available local IMCI guidelines in Southeast Asia, conducted an expert survey, and investigated out findings using data from a large multicentric prospective study on acute febrile illness. Our findings support the extension of the age range for IMCI and the inclusion of dengue relevant content. When children presented with fever, the likelihood of dengue increased with consecutive fever days. We were able to quantify how likely dengue is as a cause of fever in children living in endemic areas, stratified by duration of fever. This evidence is useful for policy makers to consider the effect of more specific diagnostic tools for the monitoring of early dengue.
