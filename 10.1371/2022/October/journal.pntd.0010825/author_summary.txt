The AMBIsome Therapy Induction OptimisatioN (AMBITION-cm) clinical trial found that a single, high-dose, intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) based regimen for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis was non-inferior to the WHO recommended first-line treatment which includes seven daily doses of intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate. The AmBisome regimen was also associated with fewer adverse events. In addition to the clinical efficacy data it is important to consider how acceptable the AmBisome regimen was from the perspectives of those who received the regimen as well as the healthcare workers administering it. To do this we conducted a qualitative methods study of in-depth interviews with AMBITION-cm trial participants, surrogate decision makers, and researchers working on the trial. These interviews were combined with direct observations of the research process and analysed thematically. The trial participants were often severely unwell and therefore the understanding of the trial was limited; however, the AmBisome regimen was generally preferred due to the single intravenous dose and fewer side effects. Researchers strongly preferred the AmBisome regimen which took less time to administer overall and was also associated with fewer side effects. We conclude that these findings complement the efficacy data from the clinical trial to support widespread implementation of the regimen.
