Schistosomiasis is a zoonotic parasitic disease that seriously affects human health. Many adults and children with schistosomiasis develop lung symptoms such as coughing, chest pain and bloody sputum. In addition to their respiratory and metabolic functions, the lungs also play a role in the immune system. MDSCs play an important role in Schistosoma infection-induced diseases. TLR7 is an intracellular member of the innate immune receptor. The role of TLR7 on MDSCs mediated immune response in the lung is still unclear. Here, our data showed that the percentage and numbers of MDSCs increased in the lung of infected mice, and the expression of TLR7 in pulmonary MDSCs was increased after infection. When TLR7 gene was knockout, the percentage of pulmonary MDSCs was increased after infection and the expression of PD-L1/2 and IL-10 were increased in S. japonicum infection-induced pulmonary MDSCs. Additionally, the effects of TLR7 on pulmonary MDSCs are dependent on the activation of NF-ÎºB p65. Finally, we found TLR7 deficiency aggravates S. japonicum infection-induced damage in the lung, with more interstitial dilatation, thickened alveolar cavity and granuloma. In this study, the characteristic of MDSCs in the lung of S. japonicum infected C57BL/6 mice was explored, and the role of TLR7 on the progress of MDSCs activation and differentiation was investigated.
