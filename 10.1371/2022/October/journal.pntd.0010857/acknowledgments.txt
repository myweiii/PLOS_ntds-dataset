We are grateful to the patients who attended the Leprosy Clinic over many years. It was a privilege to be part of the team looking after these patients with their disease that required looking after them medically and managing their disease and their reactions. They often needed support to manage the stigma that they experienced. Many healthcare professionals have helped and supported the Leprosy Clinic team at The Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London Hospitals. The nursing care was provided Miriam Henman, Anna Burnley and other members of the nursing team. The pharmacy services were provided by June Minton. Many trainee medical staff worked in the clinic. Expert Histopathology services were provided by Professor Sebastian Lucas and Dr Ula Mahadeva, St. Thomasâ€™ Hospital. Neuropathic pain services were provided by Professor Andrew Rice, Department of Pain Management, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.
Valentina de Sario helped with extracting data from case notes and data entry.
