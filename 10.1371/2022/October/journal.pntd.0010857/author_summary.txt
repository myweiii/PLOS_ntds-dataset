Malaria is caused by the bite of Anopheles mosquitoes infected with the protozoan genus Plasmodium species. Filariasis is caused by the infections of filarial nematode diseases, including lymphatic filariasis, mansonellosis, and loiasis through the bite of Anopheles and other vectors. We searched and synthesized the literatures reporting the co-occurrence of malaria and filariasis. We found that the overall prevalence of malaria and filariasis co-infections among participants of 11%. The prevalence of co-infections was 2.3% in Africa, 0.2% in Asia, and 1.6% in South America. The overall prevalences of malaria and lymphatic filariasis, malaria and loiasis, malaria and mansonellosis co-infections were 0.7%, 1.2%, and 1.0%, respectively. The co-infections between two parasites occurred by probability. Patients with co-infections of both diseases were at increased risk of having an enlarged spleen, a lower rate of severe anemia, lower parasite density, and more asymptomatic clinical status. In addition, patients with co-infections showed alterations of cytokine and chemokine levels such as C-X-C motif chemokine 5, tumor necrosis factor–α, interleukin-4, c4 complement, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10.
