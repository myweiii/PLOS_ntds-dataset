Worldwide, children are treated with deworming drugs to control the morbidity caused by intestinal worms. These drugs are provided at school through large-scale deworming programs. The frequency of deworming in a certain administrative area (e.g. a district) is based on the prevalence (proportion of children testing positive for worm infections) in that particular area. The current diagnostic standard is the microscopic detection of worm eggs in a stool smear. However, this technique has a lot of drawbacks (e.g. time-consuming, need for skilled microscopists), and makes it impossible to integrate in control programs targeting different neglected tropical diseases. A potential alternative method is serology, the detection of antibodies against worms in the blood of children. We analysed blood and stool samples for more than 6,700 children from 33 districts in Ethiopia. On district level, the seroprevalence (proportion of children having antibodies) was generally higher than the coproprevalence (proportion of children shedding worm eggs). Decisions about the frequency of deworming based on both tests showed a moderate agreement. The study is a proof-of-concept that serology holds promise as an alternative tool to monitor deworming programs. Further research should focus on the optimization of the serological assay and the refinement of serology-specific thresholds for determining deworming frequencies.
