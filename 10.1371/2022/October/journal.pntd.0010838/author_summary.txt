Head and neck mycetoma is the rarest form of mycetoma. It has devastating impacts on patients, communities, and the health system. The study concludes that: Head and neck Mycetoma -like all mycetoma- mainly affects young adult males in rural areas of Sudan. The disease is diagnosed using numerous radiological methods and investigations alongside clinical examination. Despite the CT scan being the most accurate tool, most patients are diagnosed by clinical tests only; due to the high cost of investigations and financial issues. In this study, all patients with the recurrence of head and neck mycetoma underwent surgical excision of the lesion. The worst thing about the head and neck Mycetoma is that the treatment outcome was poor and characterized by a low cure rate. More attention in is needed regarding mycetoma globally and in Sudan, especially in Gezira and Sinnar states. Therefore, screening by history and clinical examination of Mycetomataâ€™s lesions is mandatory for persons living in an endemic regions.
