Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis) is a parasitic nematode that causes debilitating disease in humans. The Guinea Worm Eradication Program would benefit from having a rapid molecular test that can confirm species identification without time-consuming DNA sequencing. We developed a qPCR protocol targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene of Guinea worm. The assay was validated analytically over 12 experiments using a standard serial dilution as well as diagnostically on DNA samples from non-target host species and other parasites (n = 180) and Guinea worm samples (n = 200) from a diversity of hosts and geographic regions. This assay could reliably detect 10 copies of the target DNA sequence and had a mean efficiency of 93.4% with 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
