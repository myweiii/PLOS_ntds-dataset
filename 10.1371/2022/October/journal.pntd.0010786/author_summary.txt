Epidemics of arthopod-borne viral (arboviral) diseases affect millions of people and are becoming more frequent and widespread. A successful strategy for their control is the infection of mosquito populations with benign Wolbachia bacteria that render mosquitoes refractory to arbovirus infection. Here we show that a strain of the major disease vector Ae. aegypti, infected with Wolbachia following a simple back-cross mating procedure, is refractory to infection with dengue and Zika viruses. Importantly, the genetic background of the strain is equivalent to the native population, which is important for its persistence and competitive fitness, and for the regulatory approval of field releases.
