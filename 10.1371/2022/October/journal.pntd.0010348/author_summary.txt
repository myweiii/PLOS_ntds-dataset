Many typhoid endemic countries have evident transmission contributions from widely distributed contaminated water supplies and/or asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers who intermittently cause sporadic outbreaks. However, these patterns have not yet been examined in the island nation of Samoa, where typhoid has remained endemic for decades. In this study, we incorporated the discerning powers of spatial-temporal cluster analyses as well as phylogenetics of whole genome sequences (WGS) of S. Typhi isolates to examine detailed epidemiologic data collected through household investigations of culture-confirmed cases of typhoid fever occurring in Samoa from April 2018 through June 2020. We detected patterns consistent with both modes of transmission, varying between urban and rural regions, and we provided evidence of intra-household transmission of genetically similar isolates, thereby supporting a majority of putative epidemiologic linkages made during household investigations, and identifying important roles for asymptomatic shedders of S. Typhi. These findings advance our understanding of persistently endemic typhoid fever in Samoa and directly support the efforts of the Samoa Typhoid Fever Control Program of the Ministry of Health of Samoa.
