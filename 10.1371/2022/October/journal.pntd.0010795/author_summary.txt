Mycetoma is a chronic infection that is recently been labelled as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) by the World Health Organization (WHO). The epidemiological features of mycetoma are not well described. The prevalence of the disease are globally underestimated. In Sudan, there are few studies reporting prevalence. In order to estimate mycetoma burden, we combined a large dataset of mycetoma cases recorded by the Mycetoma Research Centre (MRC) in Sudan with a collection of environmental and water and hygiene-related datasets in a geostatistical framework to produce estimates of the disease burden across the country. Our geostatistical models fitted based on the eumycetoma and actinomycetoma cases recorded by the MRC in Sudan between 1991 and 2018, have shown a spatially heterogeneous and distinct distribution of both mycetoma forms across this endemic country. According to our predictions, most of the eumycetoma cases would have occurred around the Khartoum area and Al Jazirah state and most of the actinomycetoma cases would have concentrated in the rural North and West Kurdufan states. Our findings here have several implications for clinical and public health practices. Both prevention and treatment services are required to address the burden. Such work provides a guide for future control and prevention programs for mycetoma, highly endemic areas are clearly targeted, and resources are directed to areas with high demand. Moreover, medical personnel will have high levels of suspicion for mycetoma in areas with high burden and cases will be adequately diagnosed and managed within their communities without the need to seek medical treatment in centralized medical facilities, in turn reducing the financial burden for mycetoma patients.
