Spliced leader trans splicing is the addition of a short sequence to the 5’ end of mRNAs. It is widespread in eukaryotic evolution, but factors that influence the splicing position have been little investigated. In trypanosomes, all protein-coding mRNAs are 5’ trans spliced. Moreover, splicing dictates polyadenylation of the preceding mRNA, which is a validated drug target. We here describe a new reporter system, which we used for a screen to define sequences needed for trans splicing. We also artificially bound a variety of proteins just upstream of the splicing signal and found that some stimulated splicing, some inhibited it, and some moved mRNA processing to a new position.
