Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, circulates extensively in the southern U.S. and working dog populations in south-central Texas are at very high risk of infection, and morbidity and early mortality due to this infection. In this study, we used low level administration of an FDA-approved drug during the transmission season to attempt to prevent new infections in these dogs. Although that effort failed, the study revealed new information about the transmission dynamics and generation of antibody responses and immune control of infection in this high-transmission setting.
