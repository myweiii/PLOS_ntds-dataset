Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus is a potentially deadly human pathogen that is transmitted by an understudied group of tropical mosquitoes (Spissipes section of the Culex subgenus Melanoconion). These mosquitoes reside in swamps and jungles, and are challenging to identify, so studying their biology and importance in transmitting VEEV has been neglected. To further our understanding of VEEV, we compared six novel and commercially available traps to determine which traps are best for capturing these species in Panama and Florida. We found that several different types of traps are effective for collecting blood-engorged females of different species of VEEV vectors, and that traps utilized for collecting unfed specimens are not necessarily the same traps one should use for collecting blood-engorged females of the same species. Results of this study will enable researchers to better capture these important disease vectors, particularly those that are blood-engorged, which will allow researchers to determine host associations necessary for understanding VEEV transmission. This information can be used to make decisions on controlling vector species.
