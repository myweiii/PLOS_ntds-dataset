Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease and a major public health problem in the tropical and subtropical world. It is caused by any of the four dengue virus serotypes. In a previously published randomised clinical trial, called the AWED trial, we demonstrated that releases of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the insect bacterium Wolbachia can reduce the case incidence of dengue by 77%. In this current study, we compared the abundance of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in the neighbourhoods where Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were released versus the untreated neighbourhoods. This was important to do so that scientists could understand the mechanism for how Wolbachia releases reduced dengue incidence. Between March 2015 and March 2020, we did not observe any differences in Ae. aegypti abundance before or after Wolbachia-deployments in the AWED trial area. There was also no difference in the abundance of the related mosquito, Ae. albopictus, before, during or after wMel-deployment. We also compared insecticide resistance characteristics amongst Ae. aegypti in the first and second years after Wolbachia -deployments and found no difference between mosquitoes from Wolbachia-treated and untreated neighbourhoods. These data suggest neither Aedes abundance, nor insecticide resistance, were confounding sources to the epidemiological outcomes of the AWED trial.
