We describe the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Q fever from a tertiary hospital in Shenzhen, a Southern Chinese metropolitan city in China. A total of 14 patients were confirmed to have Q fever during this study period. Notably, five of them were retrospectively diagnosed during case review or incidentally picked up because of another research project on patients with unexplained fever. Interestingly, some patients had rare manifestations of Q fever, such as heart failure and diffuse intracapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One patient had concomitant Q fever and brucellosis. Half of the patients were diagnosed by traditional serological test, while the other half by PCR or next-generation sequencing. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of Q fever because of its diverse and atypical manifestations. The incidence of Q fever is likely to be underestimated. Next-generation sequencing is becoming increasingly important for diagnosis of culture-negative infections.
