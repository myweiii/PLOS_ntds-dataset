As of January 2018, nearly 4000 cases of children with congenital birth defects associated with Zika virus infection, included microcephaly, had been reported in the Americas. In 2019, we interviewed eleven mothers of children with microcephaly in Colombia, a country heavily affected by the Zika epidemic. Most women were young, lived in peri-urban areas were of low socioeconomic status, according to official government classification in Colombia. They reported knowing that the virus was transmitted by mosquitoes, and how to prevent mosquito bites, yet they were not aware of Zika infection being transmitted by sexual contact. Most women had been tested for Zika during pregnancy but did not receive their laboratory results. Also, they complained that they had not received enough information from healthcare providers. When fetal anomalies were detected prenatally, only a few of them were offered the possibility to terminate the pregnancy. Women reported a lack of both economic and psychosocial support to deal with the special health care needs their children required. The results of this study highlight the struggles and challenges of families of children severely affected by the Zika virus and provide valuable information for health policy making as part of the next epidemic preparedness and response.
