    "Background": "The epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) was associated with a sudden and unprecedented increase in infants born with microcephaly. Colombia was the second most affected country by the epidemic in the Americas. Primary caregivers of children with ZIKV-associated microcephaly, their mothers mainly, were at higher risk of suffering anxiety and depression. Often, these women were stigmatized and abandoned by their partners, relatives, and communities.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This study aimed to understand the perceptions about ZIKV infection among mothers of children born with microcephaly during the ZIKV epidemic in Caribbean Colombia, and the barriers and facilitators affecting child health follow-up. An exploratory qualitative study, based on Phenomenology and Grounded Theory, was conducted in Caribbean Colombia. Data were collected through In-Depth Interviews (IDI) from women who delivered a baby with microcephaly during the ZIKV epidemic at Cl\u00ednica Salud Social, Sincelejo, Sucre District (N = 11). The themes that emerged during the interviews included experiences from their lives before pregnancy; knowledge about ZIKV; experiences and perceptions when diagnosed; considering a possible termination of pregnancy, and children\u2019s clinical follow-up. In some cases, women reported having been told they were having a baby with microcephaly but decided not to terminate the pregnancy; while in other cases, women found out about their newborn\u2019s microcephaly condition only at birth. The main barriers encountered by participants during children\u2019s follow-up included the lack of psychosocial and economic support, the stigmatization and abandonment by some partners and relatives, and the frustration of seeing the impaired development of their children.",
    "Conclusions": "This study contributed to identifying the social, medical, psychological, and economic needs of families with children affected by the ZIKV epidemic. Commitment and action by local and national governments, and international bodies, is required to ensure sustained and quality health services by affected children and their families."
