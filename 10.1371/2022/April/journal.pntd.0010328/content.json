    "Introduction": "In 2015\u201317, the epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas caused a sudden increase in children born with microcephaly and other neurological manifestations associated with severe brain lesions such as brain disruption, microcalcification, eye damage, hypertonia, and arthrogryposis [1,2]. This spectrum of signs and symptoms was described under the term Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) [1,2]. CZS includes a diverse pattern of structural brain anomalies and functional disabilities in affected children, secondary to central nervous system damage [3]. Microcephaly is its most common sign, observed in 80% of CZS cases [3]. ZIKV infection, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy, was associated with severe outcomes in fetuses and children [4]. The consequences of CZS not only involve affected children, but their environment, including their community, relatives, and their primary caregivers, usually their mothers, who are more prone to suffer anxiety and depression due to difficulties in providing the specialized care their children require [5\u201310]. Mothers of children affected by microcephaly experience significant emotional and psychological distress; as most of them are stigmatized, abandoned by their partners, relatives, and communities [5]. Additionally, it has been reported that their mental health worsens over the years [6,11]. Families were also affected by changes produced in the daily routine, which in turn, impacts the couple\u2019s relationship, the possibility to work, as sometimes one parent needs to leave the job for child care, leading to economic difficulties [12]. Most affected families are from low socioeconomic status according to official government classification in Colombia, where ZIKV cases are more prevalent, then, experiencing more restrictions to provide specialized care [5]. Repercussions of having a baby with CZS have been reported to exacerbate social inequalities and poverty [9]. Even when specialized assistance for children was received, women did not have psychosocial support to cope with this stressful situation [13].\nAccording to WHO reports, Colombia was the second country with the highest prevalence of ZIKV cases, and CZS babies in the American region, after Brazil [14]. In Colombia, the epidemic led to three to four times as many infants born with microcephaly in 2015\u20132017 compared to estimates expected in the absence of the virus [15]. Among all ZIKV cases in Colombia, 66% of them were women [16]; and its burden fell on the poorest populations [17]. However, a study performed in Colombia found a lower prevalence of ZIKV cases in poorer areas, but authors hypothesize that it could be due to the limited access of healthcare centres in poor areas to report cases, decreased inter-municipal connectivity in those places, and lower access to education, reducing medical attendance and case detection [18]. The real costs to cover the specialized care that microcephalic children require are unknown, and might be life-long. Though it is very difficult to estimate the annual cost of having a ZIKV-associated microcephalic child, a study in Brazil estimated that the healthcare treatment was 5,937 USD per child, per year [19]. ZIKV infection was most prevalent in young women that lived in the outskirts of the cities, and in low-socioeconomic statuses [20]. In Colombia, the average monthly income is 441$, and the poverty rate (population living on less than 5.5$/day) for 2018 was 27% [21]. According to official government classification in Colombia, districts are rated from 1 to 6 for its affluence. Populations living in districts of Status 1 and 2 are considered poor, and are eligible for an insurance financed by the government, entitled \u2018Subsidized health Regimen\u2019 (r\u00e9gimen subsidiado) [22,23]. However, being affiliated to this regimen has been associated with poorer health outcomes, due to social determinants of these populations, and barriers in access to healthcare services [24].\nIn 2016, the national Government implemented the ZIKV Fever Response Plan to strengthen public health surveillance systems, health education, vector control strategies and encouraged research and close monitoring of pregnant women and children\u2019s health [16]. On the 7th of January 2016, the Ministry of Health published a notice in which they recommended: \u201cAll couples living in the country, don\u2019t get pregnant during the epidemic phase, until July 2016 [\u2026] and pregnant women who do not live in an area below 2.000 msnm, not to travel to those areas for the high risk of acquiring the infection, until July 2016\u201d [25]. Regarding sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR), ten years before, in 2006, advocacy efforts contributed to the partial decriminalization of abortion in Colombia in three instances: when pregnancy constitutes a threat to the woman\u2019s health or life, if the fetus presents anomalies incompatible with life, or if pregnancy is caused by rape or incest [26,27]. Still, lack of access, makes abortion the fifth leading cause of maternal mortality in the country [26,27]. A qualitative study performed with key informants from the Colombian national and local governments, healthcare providers, community members, and affected women, concluded that a multidimensional approach that considers healthcare services, gender issues, and people\u2019s environment is crucial for the success of ZIKV campaigns; and that the effects on women\u2019s rights are related to inequalities in SRHR (increased risk of sexually transmitted infections by the poorest and most vulnerable women) [16].\nStructural gender inequities in Central and South America are well documented, and women often are not in control of their reproductive decisions [17]. Populations most affected by ZIKV often had limited access to reproductive health services, such as antenatal care, contraception counselling, and services -including emergency contraception-, safe abortion, and post-abortion care [28,29]. Many countries affected by ZIKV still have restrictive abortion laws, making safe abortion completely illegal or very difficult to access [29]. Furthermore, the epidemic did not change the voluntary abortion landscape in any relevant way. In fact, in Brazil, a law was introduced to increase jail sentences for women seeking abortion \u201cdue to microcephaly or other foetal anomaly\u201d [30]. In some countries, such as El Salvador and Colombia, authorities recommended sexual abstinence as a preventive measure against ZIKV infection [27,31]. As policies left women solely with the responsibility to avoid pregnancy, in countries where abortion is criminalized, unsafe abortions could have led to rises in maternal morbidity and mortality [5].\nZIKV was the most recent infection disproportionately affecting women in different aspects of health and wellbeing, including their emotional state and mental health. Yet, the social, economic, cultural, and personal consequences of the epidemic remain unknown; and its magnitude represents a challenge. Furthermore, the effects and ravages that Zika caused in Colombian families, are unknown. The Ebola, Cholera, Zika, and COVID-19 outbreaks raised the need to understand the social pathways of disease transmission and barriers affecting populations at risk [32,33]. The role of Anthropology in emerging outbreaks has raised global awareness for the integration of sociocultural approaches in response to international health crises [32,33]. The present study aimed to explore the views, perceptions, and attitudes, towards ZIKV, and challenges, including barriers and facilitators to medical follow-up of children born with microcephaly in the ZIKV epidemic in Caribbean Colombia, faced by their primary caregivers: their mothers.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nEthical approval for the study was granted by the Committee of the Universidad de C\u00f3rdoba, Monter\u00eda [Reg. No. FMVZ-001-2016] and by the study Cl\u00ednica Salud Social in Sincelejo Ethics Committee [Reg. No. F-GI-IV-001]. The study was conducted following the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and under the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and local rules and regulations. Participants gave written consent for the interviews to take place and be audio-recorded. All names in the transcripts were deleted to guarantee subject anonymity. All names appearing in the manuscript have been created.\n\n\nStudy design\nThis exploratory qualitative study used a phenomenological approach to understanding first-hand experiences of affected populations [34]. Grounded theory was used as a methodological and analytical approach to inductively create theoretical generalizations that emerge from the data [35].\n\n\nStudy site and population\nThe study was performed between April and July 2019. Participants were identified from a study conducted in rural and peri-urban areas in C\u00f3rdoba and Sucre departments, Caribbean Colombia. That study included a clinical follow-up of microcephalic children born at the study hospital \u201cCl\u00ednica Salud Social\u201d in Sincelejo (Sucre) during the first semester of 2016 [11,36]. Mothers of followed-up children were contacted by phone calls to participate in the current study. Inclusion criteria for study participants was defined as: having a newborn diagnosed with microcephaly during the ZIKV epidemic in Colombia, and being willing to be interviewed and audio-recorded as part of study procedures. Interviews took place in the departments of C\u00f3rdoba, Sucre, Bol\u00edvar, and Cartagena, according to women\u2019s place of residence and preference.\n\n\nData collection\nData collection took place from April to July 2019. Data were collected through In-Depth Interviews (IDI) with primary caregivers (mothers) of children born with microcephaly in 2016. When interviews occurred, children had two or three years of age, and in most of the cases, they were present during the interview. The duration of IDIs was around 45\u201360 minutes. Interviews were conducted at participants\u2019 place of preference, including health facilities (Cl\u00ednica Salud Social in Sincelejo), participant\u00b4s places of residence, or public spaces. All interviews were digitally recorded and notes were taken.\n\n\nData analysis\nInterviews were transcribed and data were coded using Dedoose software (SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC, Manhattan Beach, CA, USA). Consensus on codes and emerging themes were reached in meetings within the investigators\u00b4 team. Research began with no pre-existing hypothesis, allowing theories to inductively emerge from the data, following a systematic and circular data collection and analysis, according to Grounded Theory [35]. The theory generation was based on comparative analyses among data collected from different participants, and pre-existing conceptualizations were not used [34,37]. Overlapping themes and subthemes emerging from the participants\u2019 narratives are summarized in S1 Table.",
    "Results": "Participants\u2019 profiles\nA total of eleven women whose children were born with microcephaly born during the first semester of 2016 were enrolled in the study. The average age of participants was of 26 years. All female caregivers were the biological mothers of the microcephalic children, except for one who was the grandmother of the child whose biological parents refused to take care of the baby. All women gave birth by a C-section. Table 1 describes the sociodemographic characteristics of study participants.\n\n\nKnowledge of ZIKV and sources of information\nKnowledge of ZIKV was very diverse and related to the educational background of the women interviewed. Some women had a very basic knowledge of the virus, with gaps in knowledge in the understanding of Zika being a virus, transmission and consequences of the disease, expressed by short sentences such as \u201cZika is a disease that\u2026 is what is happening to my child, is like a bacteria that affects children, is the only thing that I know\u201d (Jenny, 20 years old), or \u201cwith the fever you have, the rash in the body, with that it is transmitted\u201d (Nadia, 21 years old). Others had very good knowledge and understanding of the virus and the disease, even including technical terms in their narratives such as \u201cbrain anomalies, microcephaly, eye defects\u201d as a consequence of infection during pregnancy, or mentioned, \u201chemorrhagic Dengue infection\u201d i.e. \u201cIt\u2019s a mild disease [Zika], generally, temporary, as happened to me. It causes pain, and once one is pregnant, it affects very much the brain and well, the normal system of the baby\u201d (Paola, 23 years old). Knowledge was generally acquired by the TV, the Internet, public health campaigns, knowledge from people inside the community, and their own experience. While some women changed their behaviour with mass media (i.e. stop watching TV) to protect themselves from seeing images about babies with microcephaly during pregnancy; others expressed the importance of news on TV or the Internet to get informed about Zika, as quoting \u201cAs far as you are, the information does not spread the same manner\u2026 what helps people more, is always TV\u201d (Judith, 29 years old). Some women expressed the importance of disseminating information about ZIKV to the general public to learn about the disease and how to prevent it, and to stakeholders to help affected families, as illustrated here:\n\u201cI think that it [information] should not remain here like a research study, but it should be information that impacts, that arrives\u2026 arrives at other settings, mainly to the areas most at risk, for people to get to know this information. The fact that not knowing the information that is affecting us, indeed affects us, whether we are infected or not. But the fact of not knowing the information affects us. In general terms, first, because we are prone to\u2026 to live it, second, once we live it, we don\u2019t know how to handle it, thirdly, for all the children, let\u2019s say, it\u2019ll affect them because if you don\u2019t know how to handle it, you cannot take decisions, right? and the correct support\u201d (Judith, 29 years old).\n\nRegarding preventive measures, many women felt resignation, and rage.The majority of them were already pregnant when recommendations of \u201cpostponing pregnancies\u201d were done, leaving them hopeless:\u201cThey started hanging postes in healthcare centers saying \u2018These are the symptoms. And then, \u2018Please, don\u2019t get pregnant!\u2019, but there were so many pregnant women already [\u2026] Those who are pregnant cannot become \u201cun-pregnant\u201d (Judith, 29 years old).\n\n\nWomen\u2019s experiences and perceptions regarding their diagnosis of ZIKV infection and or the diagnosis of microcephaly in their babies\nMost women declared that they were not ZIKV screened during pregnancy, even though they presented compatible symptoms. Those who were screened never received their results. In both cases, confirmation of maternal ZIKV infection was not possible. They expressed their concerns and feelings of \u201crage\u201d about not having their results, to know the cause of their babies\u2019 congenital anomalies and severe manifestations such as microcephaly, seizures, arthrogryposis, eye and hearing problems. ZIKV diagnosis was based on clinical and epidemiological data. Women described common symptoms of ZIKV that they experienced during pregnancy (i.e. rash, fever, body pain). One participant suggested that women who had ZIKV infection in the third month of gestation (first trimester), had the most affected children, those suffering the worst consequences, including spastic paralysis, like her baby. One woman also explained that ZIKV infection caused spontaneous abortions in her community as illustrated here:\u201cIn most of the pregnancies\u2026 where I live\u2026 babies always died in the womb. They did not achieve to progress the pregnancy\u201d (Paola, 23 years old).\nEach woman experienced a very different situation in regards to the diagnosis of anomalies in their children. Some women declared they were told about fetal anomalies during pregnancy \u201cone was informed about everything that was going to happen, and then one decided whether that was wanted or not\u201d (Paola, 23 years old). One participant declared that she was told that her baby had \u201cmicrocephaly\u201d, but she did not know what that term meant. She went home, told it to mother-in-law and she looked for the term on the Internet. Then, she felt fear when reading \u201cChildren with microcephaly are those that have a small head, problems, and seizures\u201d (Jenny, 20 years old).\nOther interviewees learned from it only once the baby was born \u201cZika was a word I learned when [name of the child] was born\u201d (Judith, 29 years old). One participant explained that she was still on the operating table when the healthcare provider asked her if she had ZIKV as quoted:\u201cThey did me a C-section. They took the baby when the doctor said \u2018Did you have Zika during pregnancy?\u2019 and my world turned upside down\u201d (Mar\u00eda, 32 years old).\nSome participants expressed the stigma and discomfort felt caused by some messages on how the idea of children born with CZS is drawn, as expressed in this quote:\u201cBasically, what was heard by society is that those children needed to be taken out from the womb [\u2026] because they were going to be born like monsters! That was what they said\u2026 and sounded horrible [\u2026] or that they would not live more than some months\u2026 that they were going to die\u201d (Adelaida, 27 years old).\n\n\nDiscussions about a possible abortion\nRegarding a possible termination of pregnancy, answers and opinions were very diverse; but all women would have appreciated more information about the course of their pregnancies\u2019, potential consequences of maternal ZIKV infection on their children, and to have been approached by healthcare professionals more skillfully to talk about such a sensitive topic. Some women were told that the baby had microcephaly while in the uterus, and could discuss a possible termination of pregnancy. Reasons for refusing it were based on their own decision, their families\u2019 decision, or religious beliefs. Sometimes, they felt \u201calmost forced to terminate the pregnancy\u201d or judged by healthcare staff and society if they decided to continue their pregnancy.\n\u201cWhat one hears from people [\u2026] Why are you going to have a baby like this? Why?\u2019 They are so cruel\u2026 After I had her\u2026 \u2018Why did you have her? You\u2019re so selfish, you had the opportunity to avoid [your baby] having such a limited life\u2019\u2026 and \u2018what makes you feel happy to have brought a baby who could never walk?\u2019 And lots of attacks\u2026\u201d (Paola, 23 years old).\n\nIn other cases, women were not given the possibility to terminate their pregnancy. Some women hesitated about the fact that healthcare providers could have known in advance information about the health status of their fetuses, so they could have discussed different options. But most of the time, the diagnosis of anomalies came too late in pregnancy or after delivery. Misinformation and absence of options regarding SRHR were noted in participants interviews:\nInterviewee: \u201cAt any time, did they tell you that there was a possibility to terminate the pregnancy?\u201d\nConsuelo: \u201cThey told me it was too late [\u2026] It was 6 months of pregnancy and that was not an option then. [\u2026] We would indeed have interrupted the pregnancy because we were not prepared for this. So, if we would have known it on time\u2026 we would have interrupted the pregnancy\u201d (Consuelo, 22 years old).\n\nOne woman explained that, even though she decided to continue her pregnancy, she would support other women and respect their personal decision of having, or not, having the baby. She said that this is a very difficult decision but needs to be addressed by each woman and her family, according to the circumstances in which they live, as these children would need special care throughout their lives. When prompted about what she would say about a woman whose fetus has been diagnosed with microcephaly, she stated \u201cWell, first\u2026 I would respect her decision, because this is something personal, because if she says she cannot have it, well, in my case, I would say I support her, I would say\u2026 I would comment on my situation with the child and so\u2026 (Carmen, 23 years old).\n\n\nDirect and indirect effects of carrying a child with microcephaly\nDuring the interviews, women expressed the feelings they experienced while being diagnosed with ZIKV, and during childcare. Common feelings and emotions expressed were fear, rage, and sadness. Women talked about fear when they knew they were ZIKV infected, but also for the future, as most of them fear that they, or any other family member, could have another child with microcephaly. Rage was expressed mainly when revealing that they did not receive their ZIKV screening results, and the lack of support they received from local and national authorities. Sadness and suffering are mentioned when talking about their child\u2019s development, either because he/she is not able to walk, or if able, suffering not to hurt other mothers. One woman mentioned that her child is the only one capable of walking in this group of children, and when the other mothers see her child in the clinic, they start walking. This mum felt pity and worried about them, so she asked the doctor to attend to them first to avoid being in the waiting room with the other families with affected children. Happiness, and gratitude are also mentioned while talking about their children\u2019s development, religious beliefs, and hope to be heard and supported. Stigma was felt in certain ways throughout the interviews. Some families disappeared, as they did not want to have a relationship with the baby (sometimes, it was thought to be due to avoid future borrowing of money); even biological parents left one of these children with his grandmother. These aspects change behaviours. Some women expressed that during pregnancy they avoided watching TV because they received terrible images of babies with microcephaly. Once they were born, mothers had to change their daily routines to take care of their babies and monitor them all day and night, and they had to learn how to do specific care procedures at home, as almost all of them explained that they are not happy with the quality of the therapies provided by the health centre. These cross-cutting issues identified within all the themes discussed are detailed in Fig 1.\nMost women, while talking about the difficulties faced raising a child with special needs, also mentioned how \u201clovely and happy\u201d they and their children are; and that their existence is the main driver in their life. But also, a participant declared that they \u201cwere not ready\u201d for assuming the challenges of caregiving a child with so many special needs. Some direct and indirect effects of caregiving a child with microcephaly in an endemic area for ZIKV, and a resource-constraint setting are detailed in Table 2.\n\n\nMain barriers and facilitators affecting adherence to medical follow-up of children with microcephaly\nMothers of children with microcephaly explained the huge range of defects their children present: neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, cerebral palsy, etc.; and, that they require specific drugs, vaccines, and therapies, to calm them, and eventually stand up and/or walk. Women explained that they need to attend daily or weekly therapies in specific clinics, and try to do daily therapies at home. While the majority of women complained that those weekly visits are far from the ideal treatment their children needed, they also expressed the barriers they had to overcome to take them to the clinic.\nOne woman explained that microcephalic children\u2019s neurodevelopment highly depends on mothers\u2019 support, by all means (economic, educational, familiar\u2026). To note, this family lives in the most socio-economically advanced household compared to the rest of the group; and they are aware that her child is the one who has developed the most (she can walk, attends school, and says a few words), quoted here:\u201cChildren\u2019s improvement from all this process of therapy highly depends on mothers\u2019 support. For example, the fact that my husband supported me from day one is very important for me. He worried because if he had to look for a ticket for going to the city [where clinical exams are being performed], he would do it\u201d (Judith, 29 years old).\nAdditionally, one woman explained the great responsibility that is having to raise a baby with so many several anomalies, in a moment when still there are no specific treatments for children exposed to ZIKV while in the uterus, and their development is uncertain:\u201cWe do not have the knowledge to carry out this huge responsibility, that sometimes, we don\u2019t know how to handle it\u201d (Adelaida, 27 years old).\nThe main barriers and facilitators detected affecting children\u2019s follow-up are described in Table 3.\nAfter the interviews, all women appreciated the space for having had the possibility to talk about their processes of pregnancy, their children\u2019s health, and their family needs; as they did not perceive to have received psychosocial support or a time to talk to anybody about their experiences and feelings during these tough years:\u201dThere is not any interest here [home country]\u2026 to say \u201clet \u2019s help these children, let\u2019s see how mothers are feeling, let\u2019s support them\u2026 with a company, talk to them to see how they feel\u201d. Thank you for this\u2026 keep in mind these children, don\u2019t leave us alone because it\u2019s tough\u201d (Carla, undefined age).",
    "Discussion": "The relevance of this study is vested in the rich in-depth information obtained on several topics raised by mothers of microcephalic children, who are still facing the consequences of the ZIKV epidemic. In Colombia, the National Healthcare Institute (INS) was in charge of analyzing all ZIKV samples, and updating epidemiological cases; but most results were not given back to patients. In Colombia, ZIKV definition relied on malformations found in fetal ultrasound and maternal clinical and/or epidemiological data. In our study, ZIKV maternal infection was not confirmed to be the cause of microcephaly due to lack of laboratory results. However, clinical and epidemiological data during pregnancy, and children clinical follow-up highly suggest it. All children in the study were born in 2016 when the ZIKV epidemic was at its peak, and laboratory resources and capacities were limited in endemic regions. Interviewees will never know if ZIKV was the cause of microcephaly, and this fact has an impact on their daily lives. These women carry the sorrow to remain forgotten by the healthcare system, public health agencies, and local, national, and international institutions. Interviewed women were very young, poor, and with different educational backgrounds. All of them were the biological mothers of children born with microcephaly in Caribbean Colombia in 2016, but one (grandmother but primary caregiver). Some women realized that the baby had microcephaly after delivery. Other women knew it, very late in pregnancy, and were offered a termination of pregnancy, but they refused it for different reasons. These children require special needs, which limits primary caregiver time and economic resources to study, work outside the home, take care of themselves, or other family members. Having a child with microcephaly changed women\u2019s trajectories, as most of them reported to be just caregivers due to difficulties in providing special needs and working outside the home.\nMost women count on their partner\u2019s and relatives\u2019 support, and some found shelter in faith, sports, and their motivation to cope with difficulties. Women felt stigmatization, and a lack of support (rejection, incomprehension, judgment) in their external social environment, and sometimes even in the most intimate one, within their families. Stigma is related to those feelings experienced, as women felt judged on many occasions. A woman explained that even though she knew about fetal anomalies, she decided to continue her pregnancy, and her friends judged her and told her she was being \u201cselfish\u201d for bringing a child with such special needs. However, a feeling of sorority could be extracted from the interviews, as women talked to the others to get advice (i.e. to apply for specific therapies, monetary compensation, etc.), support each other, and see other children\u2019s progress. Local, national, and international support to cope with the negative economic, health, and psychosocial effects of the ZIKV pandemic in affected families is almost nonexistent.\nOur results show different knowledge levels of ZIKV infection, disease, transmission, and prevention. Mostly, women with low levels of education were those with poor knowledge of the virus. Knowledge was also acquired by observations, as one participant correctly mentioned that ZIKV infections in the first trimester caused the most severe outcomes in children, after seeing other mothers in the study clinic. In line with other studies, women were not aware of the sexual transmission of the virus, thus, hampering the use of preventing measures [38\u201342]. Sexual and reproductive health education should address counselling on ZIKV, preventive methods, diagnosis, and management of the disease [42]. In our study, we noted a lack of SRHR campaigns that should have gone together with recommendations to avoid getting pregnant, along with assured access to contraceptive methods for women among all socio-economic strata. The low socio-economic status of women in this study could have influenced them for having a higher risk of ZIKV infection, and lower opportunities for being laboratory diagnosed on time, and to have had an ultrasonographic assessment to diagnose fetal microcephaly, as well as the possibilities to provide the special needs these children require. The fact that women declared that messages were prompted to women of reproductive age to avoid getting pregnant, highlighted that ZIKV was conceived as a problem of and for women. Some participants declared their incapacity to do anything as they were already pregnant. It was in line with mass media messages, that the responsibility was put on women to avoid ZIKV infection, without mentioning the role of men in the sexual transmission of the virus, and men\u2019s reproductive capacities and decisions [9,27,43,44]. Responses to public health crisis affecting SRHR, that ask women to postpone their pregnancies, are only feasible if decisions are made by women having complete information, and accessing comprehensive healthcare services within a human rights framework (modern contraception, avoid unplanned pregnancies, legal abortion services, etc.) [17]. According to a qualitative study performed with pregnant women in Puerto Rico, authors concluded that public health recommendations to avoid pregnancies must consider how these messages were perceived within specific communities [45]. The prioritization of preventive measures that people could do, such as maintaining basic breeding hygiene and removing standing water, is essential for trust-building [45]. These findings are also applicable to our context in which trust in the information received was scarce.\nWomen in our study who were offered a termination of pregnancy refused to do it based on moral values, either personal or familiar ones and religious beliefs. On the contrary, also some women declared to have preferred to terminate the pregnancy in time if they would have known the anomalies their baby presented; but this was a hypothetical situation. Our results are in line with a recent study conducted in Colombia with 21 mothers of children with ZIKV-associated microcephaly, which found that abortion was not acceptable due to ethical concerns based on religiosity, the idea of maternity, and the patriarchal culture [46]. In our study, some healthcare providers imposed their social-conservative moral values around abortion saying to women that it was \u201ctoo late\u201d to terminate a pregnancy when the woman was still in the second trimester of pregnancy; and the legal regulations allow an interruption of pregnancy. There were several barriers to overcome to obtain a safe abortion in Colombia [26]. While legal at any gestational age, abortion remains highly stigmatized in the country, and only 11% of facilities eligible to offer it, actually do so [26]. Even though abortion is not criminalized in Colombia, social decriminalization has not happened yet. For abortions to become socially accepted, there is a great need for educational work, so that women could be informed about different options to choose from during pregnancy; and have the access to perform it. Efforts are needed to provide sufficient training to healthcare providers to sensitively approach women and not to impose healthcare staff moral values on women\u2019s reproductive health decisions. Educational work directed to women, men, and healthcare staff would have beneficial effects for people to freely decide about their reproductive decisions without feeling judged. Unfortunately, the ZIKV epidemic did not have an impact on the social acceptance of abortion, nor on policies to improve SRHR in countries where those were most needed. Unsafe abortions still affect the same women for whom access to sexual and reproductive health services was restricted [17]. Women were forced to face the challenges of giving birth to children with severe neurological malformations, increasing the already existing burden they faced before the epidemic, by their precarious and vulnerable living conditions [17].\nAccording to a study that estimated the incidence of global unintended pregnancies, more than half of all pregnancies in Central and South America are unplanned, due to lack of access to good quality sexual and reproductive health education and services [41]. Differences in women\u2019s SRH access are related to intersectional inequalities; including increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, barriers to access quality primary healthcare, lack of adherence to protocols, stigma, and discrimination experienced by the poorest and most vulnerable women [16]. ZIKV amplified hierarchical structures and created inequalities. Stigmatization was not only present when women were infected by ZIKV, but they were judged because of their decisions, whether they continued, or not, their pregnancies, as seen in different interviews.\nBesides, healthcare professionals need to provide coping strategies and social support for stress reduction, especially for those families living in low-resource settings [11]. Recent epidemics, such as ZIKV, have spread in poor countries, characterized by structural inequalities, high unemployment rates, poor sanitation, lower healthcare awareness, lack of healthcare access, mental health, etc., factors that contribute to viral spread and barriers that hinder adherence to treatment [47]. Commitments to improve mental health assessments and follow-up is especially important in women pregnant in a context of great uncertainty, and mothers of already affected children [17]. The plan to address the ZIKV epidemic should go beyond health-related interventions or vector control measures and should incorporate actions to address SRHR [16]. The recognition that the effects of the epidemic affect women and men differently is necessary, along with recognition of ZIKV as a sexually transmitted disease, warrantee ZIKV screening diagnosis to pregnant women, access to contraception, and safe abortion [17]. An ethnographic study conducted in Colombia with mothers of microcephalic children highlighted the multiple negative changes that occur in the lives of their mothers, due to self-abandonment, mental and physical health outcomes [48].\nAll interviewees declared to have given birth by a C-section. This finding is in line with recent reports of increases in cesarean deliveries worldwide [49,50]. However, caesarean sections should not be routinely performed for the increased risks of maternal morbidity and mortality [50,51]. According to the WHO, these procedures should only represent 10\u201315% of all deliveries [50,51]. Studies performed in the USA, Italy, and Colombia have reported an increase in unjustified cesarean procedures in private clinics, a worrying concern due to the high costs and morbidity associated [22]. This malpractice is considered obstetric violence [52].\nChildren born with CZS have a broad range of long-term intellectual, physical, and sensory impairments [53], representing a wide-ranging impact on affected children, their families and society as a whole [54]. Microcephaly does not have a specific treatment because therapies vary depending on the degree of damage [19]. Ideal follow-up is done by a multidisciplinary team involving neurologists, neuropediatrician, speech therapy, physiotherapists, psychologist, occupational therapist, psychopedagoge, and other medical specialists [19]. Our study shows that families need to attend weekly visits to psychiatric therapies, and monthly/yearly visits to different medical services far from home and in different appointments, posing additional challenges for already poor families. Some barriers experienced by women are mainly related to lack of economic support to attend those visits, stipends for food, for somebody to accompany them, loss of productivity/work day, etc. Main facilitators for a correct follow-up of these children include monetary support for the visits, support from their couple, relatives, and the community.\nAll these barriers affect directly not only to mother and child but to the family system [55]. Duttine et al. conducted a meta-analysis about the needs of families of children with CZS and found that the caregivers of children with ZIKV-associated microcephaly experience challenges in mental health, health care access, and quality of life [55]. This is in line with the results found in the current study, within which the main barriers of families for achieving treatment adherence are healthcare access and quality of life. Duttine and colleagues found that financial hardships, difficulties with transport and services, and stigma, were other barriers faces by families [55]. Caregivers must pay transports to go to different specialists, to go to the hospital, to go to school -if children assist to school-; and, in some cases, caregivers must face stigma [55]. In the current study, one mother pointed out that she felt abandoned by the government, society, and even, by the family members. In the study of Romero-Acosta, et al, some mothers in Colombia also felt stigmatized by their own families [11]. This stigma could be perceived as abandonment from family members, above all, extended family.\nSometimes, religion acted as a coping mechanism for women to follow-up with their lives, but also healthy habits such as sport, and inner strength; as in line with other studies [11,38]. Support is also needed for concrete actions and material work for caring for these children [17]. Extensive evidence highlights that children with disabilities suffer from different exclusions related to poverty, malnutrition, vulnerability to violence, poor health, and school exclusion [54]. Difficulties will grow as adults with disabilities are less likely to be employed, and will face again poverty and social exclusion [54].\nThe main limitations of the study are that the sample size may not be big, although it does not represent a concern because of the richness of the information obtained. Regarding researchers\u2019 positionality, the interviewer was a Spanish white young woman, thus participants\u2019 responses might have been influenced by the interviewer characteristics and status (nationality, employment, economic status, etc). Additionally, a feminist interpretation of Grounded Theory was used by the researcher to give special attention to issues related to oppression and gender inequality, such as daily caregiving of these children, impact in their lives, discussions about a possible termination of pregnancy, or other issues related to sexual and reproductive health. The way these positionings might have framed social desirability in participants\u2019 responses should not be disregarded. The main strengths of the study lie in the feedback and insight provided directly by affected populations; women who faced the challenges of ZIKV during the 2015\u20132017 epidemic. Qualitative results need to be interpreted with caution, as generalization cannot be performed. The benefits of speaking the same language (interviewees and interviewers) and being a female interviewer might have increased cooperation from participants who seemed comfortable, willing to share their experiences, and participate in-depth in the discussions. Further studies are needed to explore experiences in childcare, health access and decisions about sexual and reproductive health among other affected populations, including mothers (from diverse ethnic groups, rural-urban locations, migration and socio-economic statuses), fathers, siblings, other relatives of microcephalic children, and residents of the most affected communities.",
    "Conclusions": "The ZIKV epidemic had devastating consequences on women of reproductive age. This study contributes to the understanding of the health inequities that ZIKV infection posed on women living in ZIKV affected areas, particularly among those living in areas of low socio-economic statuses, with structural inequalities, such as increased exposure to arboviruses, and lesser access to the healthcare system. Mothers of children born with microcephaly faced barriers that hindered them from accessing the specialized health care required for their children and the adequate psycho-social support for themselves. Most women had a high level of knowledge about ZIKV infection and preventive methods, though they were unaware of the sexual transmission of the virus. Their knowledge about ZIKV was acquired primarily through the mass media, the Internet, and the community, while the information provided by healthcare providers on ZIKV and its consequences was scarce or inexistent; including consideration of the possibility of pregnancy termination. It is of high importance to raise awareness of relevant stakeholders locally and globally to respond to all the public health problems including inequalities in access to the healthcare system, gender disparities, and violation of women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights. Addressing social, medical, psychological, and economic needs faced by families with children heavily affected by ZIKV is essential to ensure access to the best possible health care, so that their children may achieve their greatest potential."
