Giardia lamblia is a leading parasitic cause of diarrheal disease worldwide. Symptomatic infection is associated with abdominal pain, malabsorption and weight loss, and can lead to protracted post-infectious syndromes. Despite its medical importance, a human vaccine has not been developed against the pathogen. Here we show that two highly conserved enzymes with metabolic functions in the cytoplasm of the parasite can be used as antigens for effective vaccines against G. lamblia, thereby significantly expanding the repertoire of candidate antigens against this clinically important infection beyond primary surface proteins.
