The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health threat. Development of antiviral agents are urgently required to control the pandemic. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of berbamine hydrochloride, a bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid that is isolated from traditional Chinese medicinal Berberis amurensis. We demonstrated that berbamine hydrochloride potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the entry of the virus into the host cell. Moreover, berbamine hydrochloride and other bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids also block SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore, we analyzed the interaction of berbamine hydrochloride and viral proteins by molecular docking analysis. We found that berbamine hydrochloride could directly bind to the post fusion core of SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit, which mediates the fusion with the host membranes. Our results provide a new lead compound for antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
