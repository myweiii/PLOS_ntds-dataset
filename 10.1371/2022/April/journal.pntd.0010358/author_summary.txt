Cholera is a major global burden, with 21,000â€“143,000 deaths annually. The oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is given as two doses and is less effective in children under five years old than in those aged five years and older. However, supply is limited. In this study, we used mathematical models paired with optimization algorithms to find the optimal strategies to allocate vaccines in order to minimize the number of cases and deaths for three distinct settings in Chad, Thailand, and Haiti. We found that in the short term (1 year) when there is limited vaccine supply, it is optimal to vaccinate individuals over five years old with one dose and young children under five years old with two doses. Across the three settings, these optimal strategies prevent the most cases, save the most lives, and avert 1.2 to 1.8 times as many cases and deaths as the standard two-dose untargeted strategy. Our results support that if vaccine supply is limited, under an outbreak setting, mass vaccination campaigns with a single dose of OCV may prevent more cases and save more lives than would a standard two-dose untargeted campaign.
