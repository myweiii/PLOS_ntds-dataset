    "Background": "Dozens of commercial RT-qPCR kits for SARS-CoV-2 detection are available with or without Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA or other regulatory agencies.",
    "Objective": "We evaluated the clinical performance of two SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kits designed and produced in South America, \"COVID-19 RT-PCR Real TM FAST (CY5)\" (ATGen, Uruguay) and \"ECUGEN SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR\" (UDLA-STARNEWCORP, Ecuador), for RT-qPCR SARS-CoV2 detection using \"TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1\" (Thermofisher, USA) as a gold standard technique.",
    "Results": "We report a great clinical performance and analytical sensitivity for the two South American kits with sensitivity values of 96.4 and 100%, specificity of 100% and limit of detection in the range of 10 copies/uL of RNA extraction.",
    "Conclusions": "\"COVID-19 RT-PCR Real TM FAST (CY5)\" and \"ECUGEN SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR\" kits are reliable SARS-CoV-2 tests made in South America that have been extensively used in Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Ecuador. These locally produced SARS-CoV-2 tests have contributed to overcome supply shortages and reduce diagnosis cost, while maintaining the high quality standards of FDA EUA commercially available kits. This approach could be extended for other diagnostic products to improve infectious diseases surveillance at middle and low income countries beyond COVID-19 pandemic."
