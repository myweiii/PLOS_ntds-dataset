COVID-19 pandemic is the worst public health crisis that humanity has faced in the last decades. To success controlling the virus spread an unprecedented amount on molecular tests based on the technique called PCR has been necessary. To carry out viral infection tests, commercial kits are normally used by clinical laboratories. Those commercial kits are mainly produced in industrialized countries and that means a disadvantage in the access to COVID-19 testing in developing countries. Here we present the results of the evaluation of two commercial kits produced in South America for local stakeholders, showing how good quality biotech products can help to fight COVID-19 pandemic in low and middle income countries.
