The disease burden of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes remains high globally. Since these mosquitoes are day-biters, bed nets are not effective at preventing mosquito bites. Additionally, because Ae. aegypti preferentially breed in domestic containers, control efforts focus on reducing containers for mosquito breeding (source reduction). We developed and evaluated a household- and school-based intervention to improve knowledge and behaviors related to source reduction. We assessed caregiver knowledge and behavior before the intervention and after 3 and 12 months. Subsequently, we conducted qualitative interviews among a sub-set of participants to understand why they did or did not change their behavior. We also assessed mosquito-related indices: the number of breeding containers and immature mosquito abundance before and 12 months after the intervention. We found that those receiving the intervention had more knowledge and self-reported behavior change than those who did not. Nonetheless, the intervention had no effect on mosquito nor containers abundance. In a multi-person household, all household members need to be committed to change, not just the caregiver and child. Our study highlights how mosquito control is not an individual issue, but one that needs the participation of a sufficient majority of household and community members to ensure effectiveness.
