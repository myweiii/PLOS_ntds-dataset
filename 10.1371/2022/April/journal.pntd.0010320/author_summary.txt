The public health menace of parasites and their vectors is an issue of global public health concern. Black flies, the vector that transmit the dreadful parasite Onchocerca volvulus to its human host where it causes the debilitating disease, onchocerciasis, is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) with its greatest burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is an endemic country for onchocerciasis. Despite efforts by health agencies globally in eradicating the disease through public health awareness, chemotherapy through community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) and so on, it appears that inhabitants of Alabameta community, Osun State, southwestern, Nigeria are unaware of the bioecology of the vector as well as the public health implication of the disease according to the present study. Therefore, there is the urgent need for the government at the state and federal levels as well as health agencies to improve on public health awareness of the disease with a view to curbing exposure of residents and ultimately disease eradication.
