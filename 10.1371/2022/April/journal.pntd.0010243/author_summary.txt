The yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, has rapidly emerged as the primary cause of considerable morbidity and economic loss across the tropics, due to its high competency for transmitting arboviral diseases to human populations. Australian heath authorities have a long history of successfully eliminating populations of this species with traditional forms of mosquito control in areas sub-optimal for presence. Here we document the elimination of a population of Ae. aegypti from Gin Gin, Australia, through an extensive and locally resourced public health initiative which included the use of community engagement, traditional mosquito control, population genetics and novel surveillance tools. The documentation and outcomes presented here provide insight into modern suppression campaigns and may inform health authorities on strategies for future invasive mosquito incursions and elimination of isolated Ae. aegypti populations.
