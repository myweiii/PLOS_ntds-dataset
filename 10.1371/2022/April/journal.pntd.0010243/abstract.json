    "Abstract": "Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of exotic arboviruses (dengue, chikungunya and Zika) in Australia. Once established across much of Australia, this mosquito species remains prevalent in central and northern Queensland. In 2011, Ae. aegypti was re-discovered in the town of Gin Gin, Queensland, by health authorities during routine larval surveillance. This town is situated on a major highway that provides a distribution pathway into the highly vulnerable and populous region of the state where the species was once common. Following the detection, larval habitat and adult control activities were conducted as a public health intervention to eliminate the Ae. aegypti population and reduce the risk of exotic disease transmission. Importantly, genetic analysis revealed a homogenous cluster and small effective population vulnerable to an elimination strategy. By 2015, adult surveillance revealed the population had expanded throughout the centre of the town. In response, a collaboration between research agencies and local stakeholders activated a second control program in 2016 that included extensive community engagement, enhanced entomologic surveillance and vector control activities including the targeting of key containers, such as unsealed rainwater tanks. Here we describe a model of the public health intervention which successfully reduced the Ae. aegypti population below detection thresholds, using source reduction, insecticides and novel, intensive genetic surveillance methods. This outcome has important implications for future elimination work in small towns in regions sub-optimal for Ae. aegypti presence and reinforces the longstanding benefits of a partnership model for public health-based interventions for invasive urban mosquito species."
