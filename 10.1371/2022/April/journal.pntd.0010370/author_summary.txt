Human mobility is an important element of infectious disease outbreaks, both in terms of its spread and control. Understanding and dealing with the complex issue of human mobility warrants serious consideration in efforts to limit the spread of the disease. For these and other reasons, public health responses to infectious disease outbreaks must first be predicated upon a firm understanding of the contextual issues surrounding human movement and agency, especially those pertaining to the social, cultural and political-economic dimensions involved. Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted at five sites in Liberia in 2018/19 offered insight into the reasons people gave to account for their movements during the 2014/16 EVD outbreaks. Based on the understanding of mobility we gained from this study, we recommend that infectious disease response could be improved through the personalizing of public health messaging through the recruitment of family members and trusted local leaders to convey information that would help allay fear and combat stigmatization; activating existing traditional community surveillance systems in which entry into the community must first be approved by the community chief; and increased involvement of local leaders and community members in the provision of food and care to those quarantined so that the need to travel for these reasons is removed.
