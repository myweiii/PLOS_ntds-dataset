The current epidemiological transition of malaria observed in Gabon included, for example, a shift in the at-risk population from children aged less than 5 years old to older children aged 5–15 years. Another consequence was the increasing number of cases of infection among adults. In view of these findings, it is important to explain this phenomenon of epidemiological modification of malaria in Gabon. Intestinal parasites and blood filariasis are endemic in Gabon. These parasites are described to alter the malaria immune response and can be implicated in the susceptibility of individuals to malaria. In Gabon, malaria presents a heterogeneous repartition. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the role of co-endemic parasitosis in the alteration of the malarial immune response by comparing Th1 (IL-6 and TNF-α) and Th2/Treg (IL-10) cytokine production between mono- and co-parasitized individuals in many localities with different epidemiological patterns of malaria. Microscopic analyses and rapid antigenic tests were performed for malaria diagnosis. The nested PCR technique was used to demonstrate the submicroscopic parasitaemia of Plasmodium sp. Then, once groups with different parasitological profiles were constituted, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α levels were measured in the plasma of individuals. Th2/Th1 ratios, which can indicate the level of susceptibility of individuals to malaria, were calculated. We observed that there was no interaction between Plasmodium sp. and co-endemic parasites in the present study. However, the high Th2/Th1 cytokine ratio among patients with intestinal protozoa seems to suggest that these intestinal parasites could also play a role in susceptibility to malaria as they do for helminths.
