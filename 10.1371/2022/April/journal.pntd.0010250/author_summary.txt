Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is one of the most prevalent tropical diseases and the most common form of leishmaniasis, which is found in different regions. Due to different geographical climates, the transmission pattern and the impact of meteorological variables on CL is different. In this study we evaluated the incidence and trend of CL during 2014â€“2020 and its forecast up to 2023 in Kerman province, Iran. In addition, the impact of meteorological variables on its incidence was assessed. Our finding showed a decreasing trend of CL during the studied years. There was a negative association between CL and sunny hours per day and rainfall at lag 0.
