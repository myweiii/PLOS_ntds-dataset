Onchocerciasis or river blindness is a parasitic disease primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and Yemen. It can cause debilitating morbidity including severe itching, skin changes, visual impairment and even blindness. Many years of control efforts, today primarily based on mass administration of ivermectin (MDA) in endemic communities, have reduced morbidity and the percentage of infected individuals so that elimination of parasite transmission is now planned. WHO estimated that in 2020 more than 239 million people required MDA. Ivermectin may not be sufficiently efficacious to achieve elimination everywhere. Our study in areas in Liberia, Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo where MDA had not been implemented yet showed that one treatment with 8 mg moxidectin reduced parasite levels in the skin better and for longer than one treatment with 150 Î¼g/kg ivermectin, the dose used during MDA. Here we show that people with higher numbers of parasites in the skin benefited more from moxidectin treatment than those with lower numbers and that the efficacy of ivermectin and moxidectin differed between study areas. Provided WHO and countries include moxidectin in guidelines and policies, this information could help decisions on when and where to use moxidectin.
