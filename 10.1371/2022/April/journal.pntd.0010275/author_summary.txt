In contrast to several neighbouring Pacific Island nations, Nauruan children are heavily affected by active trachoma and the cause is ocular infection with C. trachomatis. Comprehensive public health intervention to control trachoma in Nauru is required. The use of laboratory markers for current and previous C. trachomatis infection should be considered in baseline trachoma prevalence surveys as we approach global elimination of trachoma, and in settings with inconsistent findings during previous screening exercises.
