We would like to thank the District Medical, Education and Veterinary Offices of the Ngorongoro District for their efforts on this project and for welcoming us as collaborators. We are grateful to the village leadership, chairpersons, and residents of all the communities for taking part in the study. Not only did they participate in the research, but they welcomed us into their homes and took time to speak to us. We would especially like to thank the team of community animal and human health workers who helped the interventions run so smoothly in their communities. We would like to thank Guy Palmer and Imam Mzimbiri for their close collaborations on this project. We would also like to thank our dedicated team of data collectors and drivers including: Paulo Tango, Goffrey Saro, Israel Silaa, Machunde Bigambo, Kanja John and Hussein Hassan.
