One Health approaches focus on human, animal, and environmental health and can offer a viable framework for integrated health service delivery for neglected tropical and other endemic diseases. In this study, an integrated human and animal health intervention to control both soil transmitted helminths (STH) in humans and rabies in dogs (and thereby humans) was viewed favourably by communities and suggested integrated interventions could result in increased participation. However, qualitative social science evaluation of this approach demonstrates that there are issues that may affect participation in integrated health interventions, such as local perceptions regarding hygiene issues where human and animal health are integrated. Qualitative social science research reveals that integrated interventions are more complex than at first glance and that ‘cost reduction’ should not just be the central motivation of such interventions.
