Diagnostics of leptospirosis have not been optimised yet and is considered as a significant limiting factor for estimating the disease burden. This prospective hospital-based study, including 1734 clinically suspected leptospirosis cases and undifferentiated febrile patients, revealed that a minimum of 40% of cases would be missed by using any of the following tests individually. (Whole blood qPCR, single or paired-sample MAT, Urine qPCR, culture, culture qPCR, surveillance case definition). Therefore, we conclude that whole blood qPCR should be the standard test for diagnosing leptospirosis for clinical purposes until day 10 of the reported disease. MAT should be limited to places where the serological diagnosis has an epidemiological interest. qPCR testing of microscopically-negative cultures should be done before discarding to increase the yield in research settings.
