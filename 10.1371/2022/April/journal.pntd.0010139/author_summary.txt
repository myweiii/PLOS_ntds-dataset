The mosquito Aedes albopictus transmits dengue and other arboviruses. This study investigates the genetics of these mosquitoes and their endosymbiont Wolbachia in the Indo-Pacific region, where 70% of global dengue transmission occurs. The analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences showed no evidence of cryptic Ae. albopictus but suggested three Asian lineages: East Asia, Southeast Asia and Indonesia. Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Christmas Island shared recent coancestry, and Indonesia and Timor-Leste were likely invaded from East Asia. We used bioinformatics to classify sexes and then characterized the wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia infections via both bioinformatics and quantitative PCR. We found markedly different patterns of wAlbA and wAlbB infections in the sexes. The wAlbA and wAlbB densities varied significantly among populations, suggesting site-specific factors influencing the incidence of Wolbachia infections and their densities. We also demonstrate the usefulness of next generation sequencing data in developing molecular markers that can be repeatedly reanalysed to investigate new issues as these arise. These results provide baseline data for the exploitation of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility in dengue control.
