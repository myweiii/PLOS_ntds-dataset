Past research on the interaction between the Leishmania parasite and the sand fly vector has revealed that Leishmania is capable of changing vector behavior to favor transmission of parasites in the environment. Little is known about the impact of host blood composition on parasite development inside the vector and on vector survival. Here, we showed that parasite burdens in the spleen and the liver inversely correlated to the serum blood glucose levels of infected animals, which triggered us to further investigate the effect of blood monosaccharides, insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on sand fly infection and survival. We demonstrated that normal serum glucose levels in the initial parasitized blood meal resulted in transiently higher parasite loads and a faster appearance of infectious parasites, whereas higher sugar and insulin/IGF-1 levels favored sand fly survival, which supports the concept that the host blood biochemistry may affect Leishmania transmission and sand fly longevity.
