    "Abstract": "It is well-known that Leishmania parasites can alter the behavior of the sand fly vector in order to increase their transmission potential. However, little is known about the contribution of the infecting host\u2019s blood composition on subsequent sand fly infection and survival. This study focused on the host\u2019s glucose metabolism and the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathway as both metabolic processes are known to impact vector-parasite interactions of other protozoa and insect species. The focus of this study was inspired by the observation that the glycemic levels in the blood of infected Syrian golden hamsters inversely correlated to splenic and hepatic parasite burdens. To evaluate the biological impact of these findings on further transmission, Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies were infected with blood that was artificially supplemented with different physiological concentrations of several monosaccharides, insulin or IGF-1. Normoglycemic levels resulted in transiently higher parasite loads and faster appearance of metacyclics, whereas higher carbohydrate and insulin/IGF-1 levels favored sand fly survival. Although the recorded effects were modest or transient of nature, these observations support the concept that the host blood biochemistry may affect Leishmania transmission and sand fly longevity."
