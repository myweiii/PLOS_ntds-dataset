During microbial infections, COX-2 has been well documented as a pro-inflammatory factor, while little is known about its regulatory function and mechanism. Here we described a novel role of COX-2 in regulating Giardia-induced pro-inflammatory response and defense-related NO enhancement, and this process was confirmed to be associated with ROS-dependent MAPK/NF-ÎºB activation. The findings provide invaluable insights into the mechanisms underlying anti-Giardia host inflammatory responses, however, more research efforts should be directed to clarify why Giardia infection only induces mild inflammation in the small intestine of the host, so as to fully understand the pathogenesis of giardiasis. Anyway, in combination with the anti-apoptotic role of COX-2 in enterocytes during Giardia infection as noted recently, we could infer that COX-2 might have clinical implications for giardiasis treatment.
