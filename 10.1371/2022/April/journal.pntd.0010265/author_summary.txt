Taenia solium infections in humans (taeniosis and neurocysticercosis) and in pigs (cysticercosis) are endemic in Madagascar presenting a significant public health burden. Neurocysticercosis with localization of the parasite in the Central Nervous System is the most severe and frequent form of parasitic brain diseases in humans and responsible of thousands of worldwide deaths per year. Madagascar is a T. solium endemic country where poor sanitation, free roaming pigs and outdoor defecation are common, and maintain the parasite transmission cycle. Little information is available regarding taeniosis/cysticercosis epidemiology in Madagascar. We carried out a community-based study to investigate the prevalence of human taeniosis/cysticercosis and associated risk factors in 12 rural remote villages of Ranomafana and Kelilalina townships (Ifanadiana district, Madagascar). Our results reveal that in 7/12 villages investigated, a high number of participants had teaniosis. Moreover, a high number of active cysticercosis cases were detected. Open defecation and promiscuity were seemed to be the main risk factors associated to T. solium infections. The results of this study will be useful to guide interventions in these remote settings surrounding the Ranomafana National Park.
