Aedes albopictus is an invasive vector mosquito associated with substantial public health concerns. It is a vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. High levels of ecological and physiological plasticity promote rapid global invasion. In the absence of effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for the majority of arbovirus diseases, vector control is based mostly on chemical insecticides. However, the extensive and intensive use of chemical insecticides for mosquito control has caused several environmental and human health concerns. As holometabolous insects, mosquitoes undergo considerable structural and functional remodeling during the metamorphosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play roles in developmental regulation. To investigate the expression profiles of lncRNAs across the life cycle of Ae. albopictus, five developmental time points, eggs, early larvae, late larvae, pupae, and adults (female and male), covering all developmental stages were included in this study. Differences in lncRNA expression patterns and hub lncRNAs that were highly associated with specific developmental time points were identified. Hub lncRNAs could be used as targets to block the metamorphic process and facilitate the development of efficient and sustainable mosquito control strategies.
