Amebiasis, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, is now spreading not only in developing countries, but also in many of developed countries. Unlike the situation in developing countries, transmission occurs directly from one infected person to another via sexual contact, called sexually transmitted E. histolytica infection. Furthermore, most cases of E. histolytica infection are asymptomatic, who can be a reservoir for sexual transmission in the community. Cost-effective epidemiological strategy is urgently needed. Hereby, we performed a serological test for 312 “asymptomatic” HIV-negative men who have sex with men to assess the effective screening method for E. histolytica infection. We identified 21 seropositive samples (6.7% of seropositivity, 21/312), in which relatively high seropositivity to E. histolytica was seen among the participants with positive serology for Treponema pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). Finally, we identified current infection (asymptomatic E. histolytica infection) in 8 out of 20 stool sampling cases (40.0%) by polymerase chain reaction. Our serological screening assay provides a potentially practical epidemiological strategy. Active epidemiological survey, in combination with the effective screening strategy for asymptomatically infected individuals are considered for the future control of sexually transmitted E. histolytica infection.
