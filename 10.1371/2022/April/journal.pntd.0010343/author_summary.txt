One fatal complication of chronic schistosomiasis is the development of pulmonary hypertension, a disease of progressive narrowing and obstruction of the lung blood vessels leading to heart failure. How schistosomiasis causes pulmonary hypertension is not well understood. Infection with Schistosoma mansoni is mostly clearly associated with pulmonary hypertension, and it is unclear if other species can also cause pulmonary hypertension. In this study, we experimentally exposed mice to Schistosoma japonicum, and found that they can develop pulmonary hypertension, but the severity is less than in mice exposed to Schistosoma mansoni. This may help explain why there are only a few human cases described of pulmonary hypertension following Schistosoma japonicum. We also investigated similarities and differences between the antigenic triggers of inflammation, and found that Schistosoma mansoni and japonicum antigens were substitutable for each other.
