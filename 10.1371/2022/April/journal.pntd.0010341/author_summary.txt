Severe form of human onchocerciasis also called hyperreactive onchocerciasis (HO) is characterized by skin disorders such as dermatitis. Our previous study showed that concomitant Th2 and Th17 responses play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. In Onchocerca volvulus endemic areas such as Togo, traditional healers (TH) used to treat this disease with medicinal plants such as Aframomum melegueta (AM), Xylopia aethiopica (XA) and Khaya senegalensis (KS). Mass drug administration including ivermectin and albendazole has been used over the past decade to control and eradicate helminths infections. Despite its successes, resistance to ivermectin has been reported and therefore, alternative drugs are urgently needed. We previously confirmed in vitro the anthelminthic effects of Aframomum melegueta (AM), Xylopia aethiopica (XA) and Khaya senegalensis (KS). However, their effect on severe onchocerciasis has not been demonstrated. Here, the anti-Th17 and anti-Th2 effects of hydro-ethanolic extracts of AM, XA and KS during HO were investigated. The data showed that in addition to their helminth-killing effects, plant-derived molecules AM, XA and KS downregulated Th2 and Th17 profiles and therefore, could be candidates for the development of new drugs not only for the treatment of helminth-induced inflammatory pathologies but also auto-immune Th2/Th17-dependent inflammatory diseases in general.
