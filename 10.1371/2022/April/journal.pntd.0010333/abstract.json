    "Background": "Our aim was to estimate the overall and age-specific incidence of lab-confirmed dengue fever using ELISA based assays among children 6 months to 15 years in Delhi.",
    "Methods": "We enrolled a cohort of 984 children aged 6 months to <14 years in South Delhi and followed-up weekly for fever for 24 months or till 15 completed years of child-age. Households of the enrolled children were geo-tagged. NS1, IgM and IgG assays were conducted using ELISA method to confirm dengue fever in children with \u22653 consecutive days of fever. Molecular typing was done in a subset of NS1 positive cases to identify the circulating serotypes.",
    "Principal findings": "We had a total of 1953 person-years (PY) of follow up. Overall, there were 4208 episodes of fever with peaks during June to November. The overall incidence (95%CI) of fever was 215/100 PY (209 to 222). A total of 74/1250 3-day fever episodes were positive for acute dengue fever (NS1 and/or IgM positive). The overall incidence (95%CI) of acute dengue fever was 37.9 (29.8 to 47.6) per 1000 PY; highest among children aged 5 to 10 years (50.4 per 1000 PY, 95% CI 36.5 to 67.8). Spatial autocorrelation analysis suggested a clustering pattern for the dengue fever cases (Moran\u2019s Index 0.35, z-score 1.8, p = 0.06). Dengue PCR was positive in 16 of the 24 specimens tested; DEN 3 was the predominant serotype identified in 15/24 specimens.",
    "Conclusions": "We found a high incidence of dengue fever among under 15-year children with clustering of cases in the community. DEN 3 was the most commonly circulating strain encountered. The findings underscore the need for development of affordable pre-vaccination screening strategy as well as newer dengue vaccines for young children while continuing efforts in vector control."
