South Asian countries especially the Indian subcontinent contributes the highest to the global burden of dengue. The number of dengue cases reported in India is likely an underestimate of the actual disease burden and there is a clear lack in the availability of population-based data on incidence of dengue in India. In our pediatric cohort of 984 children aged 6 months to 15 years from Delhi, India, we found a high incidence of lab-confirmed dengue fever, with the highest burden among 5 to 10 year old children. Dengue fever was observed to be highest in the post-monsoon months with significant clustering of cases in the community. DEN 3 was the most commonly circulating strain encountered. Given the high burden in children, the findings highlight the need for strengthening efforts to developing newer dengue vaccines for younger children.
