Diagnosis of the important mosquito-transmitted dengue virus (DENV) requires laboratory assays to detect viral genome (RT-PCR), viral NS1 protein (immunoassay) or DENV specific antibodies. Current point-of-care NS1 tests cannot distinguish serotype, so laboratory tests are still essential to determine which of 4 DENV serotypes is present. Here we present a rapid serotype-specific NS1 test in a portable microfluidic format. Ten parallel 0.2 mm tubes inside a flat plastic ribbon perform multiplex NS1 immunoassays. A simple cassette delivers sample and reagents sequentially through the microcapillaries by gravity. By stacking cassettes, 12 tests could be performed in under 40 minutes, with results recorded by smartphone. When evaluated with 205 patients plus 50 control samples, and results compared to conventional RT-PCR, the sensitivity for DENV1 to 4 was 78%, 78%, 80%, and 76%, respectively, with specificity of 100% for DENV2-4. DENV1 showed some false positives due to cross-reactivity of the capture antibody. Serotyping performance with MCF-Cygnus devices showed substantial agreement to the serotyping-NS1 microplate ELISA. Therefore, these simple and portable microcapillary immunoassay devices could support dengue NS1 serotyping with potential benefits for near-patient diagnosis, real-time epidemic surveillance and outbreak mapping.
