Murine typhus is a flea-borne zoonotic disease with acute febrile illness caused by Rickettsia typhi and is distributed widely throughout the world, particularly in port cities and coastal regions. Early treatment with appropriate antibiotics for murine typhus could effectively shorten the duration of illness and reduce the risk of hospitalization and fatality. However, it presents with nonspecific symptoms and is oftentimes misdiagnosed. In Taiwan, murine typhus has been designated a notifiable disease since 2007. Meanwhile, surveillance of R. typhi infection of small mammals was also launched at 25 international airports and harbors. Since then, we observed that indigenous murine typhus patients have been detected in Taiwan annually and sera collected from small mammals trapped in ports also demonstrated anti-R. typhi antibody responses. Correspondingly, the ports with the highest seropositivity are all inside/near the areas with the highest incidence rate of indigenous murine typhus in Taiwan. We further found that incidence rates in humans were positively correlated with the 1-month and 2-month prior seropositive rates in small mammals. Surveillance in small mammals might be helpful for the development of real-time reporting or even early reminders of sporadic murine typhus cases based on the delayed correlation observed in this study.
