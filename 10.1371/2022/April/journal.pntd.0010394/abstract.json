    "Abstract": "Murine typhus is a flea-borne zoonotic disease with acute febrile illness caused by Rickettsia typhi and is distributed widely throughout the world, particularly in port cities and coastal regions. We observed that murine typhus was an endemic disease (number of annual indigenous cases = 29.23\u00b18.76) with a low incidence rate (0.13\u00b12.03*10\u22124 per 100,000 person-years) in Taiwan from 2007\u20132019. Most (45.79%, 174/380) indigenous infections were reported in May, June, and July. The incidence rates in both May and June were statistically higher than those in other months (p<0.05). Correspondingly, sera collected from small mammals (rodents and shrews) trapped in airports and harbors demonstrated anti-R. typhi antibody responses (seropositive rate = 8.24\u00b10.33%). Interestingly, the ports with the highest seropositivity rates in small mammals are all inside/near the areas with the highest incidence rates of indigenous murine typhus. In addition, incidence rates in humans were positively correlated with the 1-month and 2-month prior seropositive rates in small mammals (R = 0.31 and 0.37, respectively). As early treatment with appropriate antibiotics for murine typhus could effectively shorten the duration of illness and reduce the risk of hospitalization and fatality, flea-related exposure experience should be considered in clinics during peak seasons and the months after a rise in seropositivity rates in small mammals. Surveillance in small mammals might be helpful for the development of real-time reporting or even early reminders for physicians of sporadic murine typhus cases based on the delayed correlation observed in this study."
