To determine the role of meteorological variables, seasonal variation and temporal trends in the incidence of leptospirosis, we investigated the time series of leptospirosis incidence amongst residents of Salvador, Brazil, from 1996 to 2010. Exploratory and confirmatory statistical methods detected associations between meteorological anomalies and disease incidence. Results showed the importance of extreme meteorological conditions, particularly rainfall, as short-term predictors of leptospirosis incidence. In addition, we found a long-term decreasing trend in disease incidence over the observation period.
