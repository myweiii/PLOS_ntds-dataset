The study investigated different clinical features and risk factors for severe disease between pediatric and elderly patients with scrub typhus. We found that significantly higher frequencies of lymphadenopathy, skin rash, enlarged tonsils, etc. were observed in pediatric patients than elderly patients. Other non-specific signs, subjective complaints, and chest radiographic abnormality were overpresented in elderly patients. Risk factors for severe disease between pediatric and elderly patients with scrub typhus were different. Presence of peripheral edema and decreased hemoglobin were the most important factors for pediatric patients, while presence of dyspnea and increased total bilirubin for elderly patients. These findings reminded medical workers to acknowledge this important difference and to adopt an age specific method in the differential diagnosis and risk assessment for scrub typhus.
