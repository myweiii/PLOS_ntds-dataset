Chagas disease (CD) is a public health problem despite the partial control of its transmission. Up to 30% of infected people may have cardiac alterations, which are associated with a worse prognosis, with high mortality rates. One of the strategies that can be used to define interventions in order to reduce the impact of CD would be Machine Learning (ML). Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate different models of ML to predict death in two years of patients with CD. We included 1,694 patients with CD, considering 21 municipalities in endemic regions in Brazil over a two-year period. Of these, 7.9% died. Our study revealed that it is possible to develop ML models which allows the development of tools to predict death within two years, among patients with CD. The different techniques ranged G-mean from 0.59 to 0.77. Thus, we observed that ML can be used as a useful tool with the potential to contribute to the management of patients with CD worldwide, by identifying patients with a higher probability of death.
