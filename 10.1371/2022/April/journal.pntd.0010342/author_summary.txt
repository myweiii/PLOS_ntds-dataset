High prevalence of Rift Valley fever virus, Coxiella burnetii and Bluetongue virus were observed in cattle, sheep, and goats. We provided evidence that animals of the same herds have to cope with several pathogens. This study points out to need for important follow up studies to fill further knowledge gaps related to impacts of livestock diseases in Mali, especially zoonoses, and how to address the challenges.
