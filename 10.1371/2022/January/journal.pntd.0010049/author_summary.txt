P. falciparum is the dominant malaria species worldwide and is often the primary, or only, focus of malaria surveys. For this reason, other human malarias (P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale) may be co-endemic in the same population but left unobserved by non-microscopy strategies as countries do not invest in diagnostic capacity to detect these species. Additionally, as these non-falciparum malarias may circulate subpatently, epidemiological measurements through health facility reporting do poorly at estimating the true burden in the population. Antibodies against malaria antigens may exist in persons long after malaria parasites have been cleared and offer an indicator of malaria exposure rather than a test for active infection. For areas in the world with multiple co-endemic malaria species, testing for antibodies against species-specific antigens can allow evaluation of the population burden of all human malarias, not just the dominant or most clinically-relevant species. Serological data can further assist countries as they work towards elimination of all malarias within their borders.
