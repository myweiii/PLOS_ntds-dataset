Globally, there are at present 17 different officially recognized lyssavirus species posing a potential threat for human and animal health. Bats have been identified as carriers for the vast majority of those zoonotic viruses, which cause the fatal disease rabies and are transmitted through infectious saliva. The occurrence of sporadic spillover events where lyssaviruses are spread from bats to other mammalian species highlights the importance of studying pathogenicity and virus shedding in regard to a potentially sustained onward cross-species transmission. Therefore, as part of this study, we compared 13 different isolates from ten lyssavirus species in a standardized mouse infection model, focusing on clinical signs, incubation periods, and survival. Based on the latter two, a novel pathogenicity index to classify different lyssavirus species was established. This pathogenicity index varied within and between different lyssavirus species and revealed a higher ranking of other bat-related lyssaviruses in comparison to the tested Rabies virus (RABV) isolates. Altogether, our results demonstrate a high diversity among the investigated isolates concerning pathogenicity and clinical picture. Furthermore, we comparatively analyzed virus shedding via saliva and while there was no indication towards a reduced pathogenicity of bat-associated lyssaviruses as opposed to RABV, shedding was increased in RABV isolates. Additionally, we investigated neuronal cell tropism and revealed that bat lyssaviruses are not only capable of infecting neurons but also astrocytes.
