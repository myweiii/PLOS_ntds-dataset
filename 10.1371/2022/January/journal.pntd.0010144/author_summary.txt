Previous systematic reviews have highlighted the research priorities of causative agents for non-malarial febrile illnesses by counting the number of publications attributed to an agent. However, proportional morbidity rates are calculated by dividing the number of cases with a specific disease (numerator) by the total number of diagnosed fever cases (denominator) and are better indicators of the relative importance of aetiological agents in a population. Therefore, we present the leading causes of non-malarial febrile illnesses in African patients in both healthcare and community settings. Preference is given to HIV-negative patients when data could be found. We also determined summary estimates of Brucella spp., Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, Haemophilus spp., Klebsiella spp., Leptospira spp., non-typhoidal Salmonella spp., typhoidal Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp.
The wide array of aetiological agents causing febrile illnesses on the African continent does not only complicate malaria control programs but may also hamper response to epidemic and pandemic illnesses such as Ebola and COVID-19. The harmonisation of diagnostics and study designs will reduce between-study differences, which may result in better estimates of disease burden on the continent and in the different African regions. This information is important for Pan-African surveillance and control efforts.
