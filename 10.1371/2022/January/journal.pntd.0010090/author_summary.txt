EV71-HFMD is now prevalent in many Asia countries, including China, which caused a lot of death over the last few years. Therefore, itâ€™s important to distinguish patients with a severe tendency. In this research, we investigated the association between the epigenetic mechanisms of RIG-I-like pattern recognition receptors (DDX58 and IFIH1) and EV71-HFMD. It showed that children with higher level of DDX58 promoter methylation were related to severe EV71-HFMD and other clinical indicators. The DDX58 mRNA expression level was significantly lower in severe patients. Besides, DDX58 polymorphisms played an important role in the severity of EV71-HFMD. Therefore, various epigenetic biomarkers of DDX58 may be used as indicators to help clinicians identify EV71-HFMD patients with a tendency towards severity.
