Understanding the risk and risk factors of dengue and Zika virus (DENV, ZIKV) infection improves their prevention. We leveraged a U.S. Department of Defense sera repository to identify sero-exposures to DENV and ZIKV in 500 adults performing military service in Puerto Rico through early 2015, the majority of who were born or previously resided in Puerto Rico. The mean duration of military service before sera were collected was 5.2 years. Serological results indicated ZIKV may have been circulating in Puerto Rico for at least 4 months before the first cases were detected in this territory. We noted ZIKV false-positivity to reference serological methods when paired sera are not available. 66.8% of the total study sample was DENV seropositive by 2015; at least 21.8% apparently had a prior single dengue infection. Among those with birth/residence in a non-dengue-endemic country, we noted an increase in the odds of DENV exposure for each year of military service in Puerto Rico. In those with birth/residence in dengue-endemic regions, we noted that age, rather than duration of Puerto Rico service, was associated with dengue seropositivity, suggesting earlier lifetime DENV exposure. Our findings provide insights into the risk and risk factors of these two important arboviruses.
