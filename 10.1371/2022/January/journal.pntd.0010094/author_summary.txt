Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an infectious disease transmitted by the infected reservoir hosts, which chiefly include rodents, shrews, and moles. The mechanism of HFRS infection is determined by a complex interplay of various natural and socioeconomic factors. Previous studies have identified a close relationship between urbanization processes and HFRS transmission dynamics. However, the relationship involves a dual response and has not yet been quantitatively identified. This research aimed to spatiotemporally characterize how rapid urbanization affects the dynamics of HFRS. In addition, the role of water bodies, vegetation, rainfall, and occupation types in epidemic transmissions has also not been adequately investigated at the interurban scale over a long time period. Therefore, we analyzed the spatiotemporal association between the distributions of water bodies and HFRS infections and also investigated the interactions between urbanization, water body, vegetation, rainfall, and different occupation types by using multi-source data through both traditional statistical and geospatial techniques. Our work revealed biphasic associations among HFRS infection with both rapid urbanization and distribution of water bodies. Hence, it can provide useful information to formulate effective strategies for the prevention and control of HFRS.
