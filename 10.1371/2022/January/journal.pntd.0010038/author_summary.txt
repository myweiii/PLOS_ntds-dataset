Leprosy is an infectious disease known for its long incubation period, which contributes to delays in diagnosis that can result in irreversible deformities, mainly of the hands, feet and eyes. To prevent impairments, early case detection followed by prompt treatment of new patients is important. A large-scale intervention study called PEP4LEP was designed to determine the most effective method to implement integrated skin screening and leprosy post-exposure prophylaxis administration with a single-dose rifampicin (SDR-PEP). The main objective of PEP4LEP is to evaluate the effectiveness of two SDR-PEP implementation approaches, by assessing the rate of leprosy patients detected and the case detection delay (CDD) of leprosy in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Tanzania. The CDD is defined as the period between the onset of the first signs of the disease and the diagnosis of leprosy. A standardized tool was needed to measure the CDD in PEP4LEP. Therefore, the aim of this study was to design this methodological tool by conducting a cultural validation study, in which health professionals, leprosy experts, and persons affected by leprosy were consulted. The outcome of this study is a tool, comprising a short questionnaire with two annexes and a ‘Question-by-Question Guide’, to support the administration of the questionnaire.
