Strongyloides stercoralis is a worm that infects people and some animals. It can live in its host for decades because it can continually produce more larvae that develop inside the body of its host. The initial infection usually occurs by larvae burrowing through the skin of a person. The growing larvae travel to the lungs where they are coughed up and swallowed. Then, in the intestine, they mature to adults capable of producing eggs. The eggs hatch before they can be passed out of the body in the stool. The newly hatched larvae burrow through the gut wall and repeat this internal cycle. To diagnose this infection, one strategy is detecting antibodies against these worms. Herein, we discuss a prototype ELISA assay using recombinant Strongyloides stercoralis proteins. The test, called Strongy Detect, did well at detecting antibodies in patients known to have the infection and at calling samples negative when the patients were uninfected. The antibodies were detectable more than a year after patients were treated for the disease. If further validation studies confirm the utility of this assay, it will be an important addition to the armamentarium of tests to diagnose Strongyloides stercoralis infection.
