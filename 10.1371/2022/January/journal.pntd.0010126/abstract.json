    "Background": "Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) is the etiological agent of strongyloidiasis, a neglected tropical disease of global concern. Laboratory diagnosis of strongyloidiasis is most often based on detection of antibodies against antigens in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Herein, we report a preliminary validation study of newly developed IgG4- and/or IgG- based ELISAs to detect strongyloidiasis (Strongy Detect, InBios) incorporating a cocktail of 2 previously described recombinant antigens, Ss-NIE and Ss-IR.",
    "Methods": "The sensitivity and specificity were determined by using the assay in 150 cryopreserved serum samples from humans known to be Ss infected (n = 74), helminth uninfected (n = 47), or infected with a helminth other than Ss [n = 29). The treatment associated dynamics of antibody detection were then assessed using 35 paired samples obtained before and after definitive therapy.",
    "Results": "The IgG and IgG4 assays were 99% and 96% sensitive, respectively, and 99% and 100% specific, respectively. Neither the IgG or IgG4 assay showed cross reactions with sera from those infected with other helminths. Although ELISA values did decline post-treatment few returned to levels below the cutoff for infection.",
    "Conclusion": "Strongy Detect is the most sensitive and specific commercialized immunoassay for detection of strongyloidiasis. The assay remains positive for greater than a year post-treatment."
