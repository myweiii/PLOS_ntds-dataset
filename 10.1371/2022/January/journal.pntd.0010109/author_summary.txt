Cysticercosis and cystic echinococcosis are caused by infection with the larval stages of Taenia solium and Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, respectively, and their distribution largely overlaps in many areas of the world. Currently, the WHO is calling for the need to map endemic areas for cysticercosis, where control programs should be applied. Serosurveys may serve this scope, but cross-reactivities may be an issue. This study evaluated the accuracy of two recombinant antigens (rT24H and r2B2t) specific for each parasite used together applying a novel multiple bead technology assay (MBA), and compared the results with two commercial ELISA tests for the diagnosis of these infections. We found that this method, although not 100% specific, provides better results than those obtained with the commercially available tests, with the added advantage of testing simultaneously for both infections using just one sample, and could prove an efficient and rapid support for serological screening studies to map areas of cysticercosis transmission. Importantly, this novel method based on MBA technology is open and flexible, allowing continuous improvement due to its ability to simultaneously introduce new recombinant antigens as they are discovered/defined.
