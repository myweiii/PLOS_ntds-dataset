Yellow fever virus (YFV) is transmitted by mosquitoes, and its infection can lead to a lethal viral hemorrhagic fever associated with liver damage. While an effective vaccine is available, in places where the vaccination rate is low, in the event of an unexpected outbreak, or where vaccination is not recommended individually, having an effective antiviral treatment is critical. We previously reported that the nucleotide analog prodrug AT-752 potently inhibited the YFV in cultured cells. Here we showed that in hamsters infected with YFV, oral treatment with 1000 mg/kg AT-752 for 7 days reduced the production of infectious virus particles in the blood, and decreased serum alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver damage, to levels measured in uninfected animals. In addition, at 21 days after infection, 70â€“100% of the infected animals in the treatment groups survived compared to 0% in the untreated group. Moreover, the amount of the active metabolite formed from AT-752 was highest in the livers and kidneys of the treated animals, organs that are targeted by the virus. These results suggest that AT-752 is a promising compound to develop for the treatment of YFV infection.
