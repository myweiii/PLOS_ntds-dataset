Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a globally important mosquito-transmitted zoonosis that is also directly transmissible via aerosolization of body fluids from infected animals. RVFV outbreaks cause mass mortality of young livestock and pregnancy losses in both humans and animals. Severe human cases also result in hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and death. Loss of livestock additionally threatens the livelihood of people who depend on animals for income and food. In endemic areas, initiation of RVFV outbreaks is connected to weather events that cause excess rainfall, leading to flooding and subsequent mosquito blooms. However, the natural cycle of RVFV transmission is complex, requiring congregation of susceptible mammalian hosts and mosquito vectors in suitable environments. Several human vaccine candidates are in different stages of development, but none are yet licensed for use in human populations. In this systematic review, we assessed the 1999â€“2021 frequency and distribution of RVFV outbreaks among humans, animals, and vectors to identify potential locations and population targets for a human RVFV vaccine efficacy trial. It focuses on current understanding of RVFV epidemiology and the identification of gaps that pose critical barriers to controlling expansion of RVFV and implementing new protective measures including human vaccination.
