This large-scale multi-country study explores perceived COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, acceptability, and hesitancy rates and their related factors among the general adult populations from 20 countries. We found that a considerable proportion of the participants has an intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. However, more than half still expressed their hesitancy to receive the vaccines. Countries where the majority of respondents responded that they would accept COVID-19 vaccination included Malaysia (96.0%), Bangladesh (93.6%), and Iraq (91.8%). The majority of the participants from Vietnam (86.0%) and Turkey (74.7%) expressed hesitance to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Perceived vaccine effectiveness ranged from 67.8% in Egypt to 95.9% in Malaysia. The participants believed that convenience, health providersâ€™ advice, and costs of vaccines are important for people to decide whether to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Country of residence, age, sex, level of education, area of residence, marital status, and family economic status were significantly associated with tendency to undergo COVID-19 vaccination and the perception that COVID-19 vaccine decision-making is influenced by convenience. The findings of this study provide useful guidance for tailored interventions to enhance the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. Promotional program addressed on detected socioeconomic factors is warranted.
