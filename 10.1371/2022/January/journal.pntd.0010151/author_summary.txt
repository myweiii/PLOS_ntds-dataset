Schistosoma haematobium, the leading cause of urogenital schistosomiasis, affects millions of people worldwide. Infection with this parasite is associated with different clinical complications such as squamous cell carcinoma and genital malignancy in women. Despite its importance, there is a lack of sensitive and specific diagnostics that support control and elimination initiatives against this devastating disease. Herein, we have characterised six molecules belonging to the tetraspanin family of membrane proteins, providing details about their relative expression during parasiteâ€™s development and their localization in adult forms of S. haematobium. Furthermore, we have characterised the antibody responses against three of these molecules in urine from infected human subjects from an endemic area, providing compelling evidence for the use of these molecules to diagnose urogenital schistosomiasis.
