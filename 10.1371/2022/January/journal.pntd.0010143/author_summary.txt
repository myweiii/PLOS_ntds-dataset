Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is common in Ethiopia, and mainly affects rural areas with poor access to health care. CL is routinely diagnosed using microscopy on a skin slit sample, which requires skilled staff and appropriately equipped laboratories. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the CL Detect Rapid Test as an alternative which could be used in field settings. In a population of 165 patients suspected to have CL, 78% was confirmed to have CL by PCR. We found that the CL Detect Rapid Test on the supplied dental broach had a sensitivity of only 23%; on a skin slit sample, the Rapid Test had a slightly higher sensitivity with 31%. The routine diagnostic test of microscopy on the skin slit had a significantly higher sensitivity with 56%. These findings show that the sensitivity of the CL Detect Rapid Test is low, and is much worse than that of the currently used diagnostic method. Therefore, we do not recommend it to be used for diagnosing CL in Ethiopia.
