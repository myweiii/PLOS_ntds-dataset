The primary dengue virus vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, are primarily daytime biting mosquitoes and therefore the risk of infection may be considerable in urban parks due to human foot traffic. Prior to the present study little information was available on vector populations in urban parks. Here we describe that larvae of both species were positively associated with discarded containers and planters. Aedes albopictus larvae were negatively associated with indoor habitats, but positively associated with vegetation shade. Aedes albopictus was predominant in the urban parks while A. aegypti was predominant in adjacent residential areas. When the species were combined the density of vectors was greater in the urban parks. The current vector control programs need to take into consideration vector intensity within urban parks.
