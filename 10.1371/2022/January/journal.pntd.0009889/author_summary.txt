Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that require a snail host and a mammalian host to complete their life cycle. Due to the difficulties in obtaining materials, little is known about the molecular aspects of this flukeâ€™s larval stages. Based on RNA-Seq, we provide the first high-resolution, transcriptomic analysis of four larval stages of Schistosoma japonicum. The data showed the biological and physical features of each stage, also highlighted that miracidia and cercariae might use a different group of proteases for host invasion. Additionally, it indicated that different populations of germinal cells may exist in the larval stages. The high expression of tandem duplicated cathepsin B-like proteases at the cercariae stage may contribute to the wide definitive host range of S. japonicum. Additionally, we observed that alternative splicing plays a vital role in regulating gene expression in S. japonicum, among which skip exon was the most predominant. Our data provide valuable information on the expression and function of S. japonicum genes across their larval stages and will support basic and applied research for the community.
