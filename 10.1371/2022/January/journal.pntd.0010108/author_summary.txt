Onchocerciasis, a disease caused by the helminth parasite Onchocerca volvulus, is transmitted by the bites of female Simulium blackflies. The disease is still endemic in many African countries, and the World Health Organization has proposed elimination of its transmission in 12 countries by 2030. Understanding the heterogeneity in human exposure to vector bites can help discern which portion of the population is at higher risk of acquiring/ transmitting infection and is fundamental to identifying target groups for serological monitoring and transmission control. Traditionally, blackfly biting rates are estimated by performing human landing catches, a method that is often considered unethical and which can be unreliable as a representative measure. Therefore, we used our recently developed immunoassays to measure human antibody responses to antigens contained in the saliva of blackflies and deposited into human skin when they bloodfeed. In onchocerciasis endemic communities in Ghana, we measured antibody responses to understand age- and/or sex-related demographic patterns in vector exposure. We observed lower antibody responses in males compared to in females, and a substantial decline with increasing age, suggesting that high blackfly biting pressure induces desensitization in the human host.
