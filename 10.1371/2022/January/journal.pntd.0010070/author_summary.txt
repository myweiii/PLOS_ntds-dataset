Neuropathy is responsible for most of the disability associated with leprosy disease. The pure neural leprosy (PNL), in spite of being a rare clinical presentation of that, has some singular characteristics that are still poorly studied. In this study, we selected 52 patients at the diagnosis to describe their clinical, neurophysiological and histopathological presentation patterns as well as their evolution during the multidrug therapy (MDT). We confirmed that sensitive symptoms were the most commonly described by PNL patients but neural pain is rare. Also confirmed that mononeuropathy mutiplex was the most common pattern observed at neurological examination and at the nerve conduction studies at the moment of the diagnosis. However we showed that painful nerve enlargement other cardinal signs of leprosy, besides the skin lesions, is not common in this group of patients, There was no statistically significant difference between the neurological examination and NCS performed before and after the MDT.During the MDT88.4% of the patients did not have any leprosy reaction. This may suggest that that MDT was effective in stopping disease progression. Our results highlight the difficulties in the diagnosis of PNL and the progression following MDT in an attempt to prevent further disability in PNL patients.
