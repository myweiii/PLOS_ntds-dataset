In response to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, countries worldwide have implemented multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that restrict movement, such as school closure and stay-at-home requirements, and introduced large nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. However, there were variations in population compliance and vaccine coverage worldwide. The virus is continuously spreading and new genetic variants are emerging. In this context, we chose eight countries as being representative of the worldwide ranges of population density, variant spread, vaccination, population compliance to countermeasures, and effectiveness of implemented measures. Our study identified the most common effective countermeasures and estimated the lag times for a response to NPIs and for the onset of a vaccination effect. We found a rebound was most likely to occur during the 40 days after the first vaccine dose and both NPIs and vaccine coverage are indispensable in the current context of Delta variant high prevalence. We hope that the results of this study could provide some guidance for controlling the pandemic.
