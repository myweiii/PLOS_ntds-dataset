    "Abstract": "Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Shigella spp (Shigella) are complex pathogens. The diagnostic assays currently used to detect these pathogens are elaborate or complicated, which make them difficult to apply in resource poor settings where these diseases are endemic. The culture methods used to detect Shigella are not sensitive, and the methods used to detect ETEC are only available in a few research labs. To address this gap, we developed a rapid and simple diagnostic assay\u2013\"Rapid LAMP based Diagnostic Test (RLDT).\" The six minutes sample preparation method directly from the fecal samples with lyophilized reaction strips and using established Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) platform, ETEC [heat labile toxin (LT) and heat stable toxins (STh, and STp) genes] and Shigella (ipaH gene) detection was made simple, rapid (<50 minutes), and inexpensive. This assay is cold chain and electricity free. Moreover, RLDT requires minimal equipment. To avoid any end user\u2019s bias, a battery-operated, handheld reader was used to read the RLDT results. The results can be read as positive/negative or as real time amplification depending on the end user\u2019s need. The performance specifications of the RLDT assay, including analytical sensitivity and specificity, were evaluated using fecal samples spiked with ETEC and Shigella strains. The limit of detection was ~105 CFU/gm of stool for LT, STh, and STp and ~104 CFU/gm of stool for the ipaH gene, which corresponds to about 23 CFU and 1 CFU respectively for ETEC and Shigella per 25uL reaction within 40 minutes. The RLDT assay from stool collection to result is simple, and rapid and at the same time sufficiently sensitive. RLDT has the potential to be applied in resource poor endemic settings for the rapid diagnosis of ETEC and Shigella."
