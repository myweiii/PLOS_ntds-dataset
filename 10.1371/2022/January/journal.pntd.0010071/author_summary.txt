As the incidence of infectious diseases like dengue continues to increase throughout the world, tracking their spread in real time poses a significant challenge to local and national health authorities. Accurate incidence data are often difficult to obtain as outbreaks emerge and unfold, both due the partial reach of serological surveillance (especially in rural areas), and due to delays in reporting, which result in post-hoc adjustments to what should have been real-time data. Thus, a range of ‘nowcasting’ tools have been developed to estimate disease trends, using different mathematical and statistical methodologies to fill the temporal data gap. Over the past several years, researchers have investigated how to best incorporate internet search data into predictive models, since these can be obtained in real-time. Still, most such models have been regression-based, and have tended to underperform in cases when epidemiological data are only available after long reporting delays. Moreover, in tropical countries, attention has increasingly turned from testing and applying models at the national level to models at higher spatial resolutions, such as states and cities. Here, we develop machine learning models based on both LASSO regression and on random forest ensembles, and proceed to apply and compare them across 20 cities in Brazil. We find that our methodology produces meaningful and actionable disease estimates at the city level with both underlying model classes, and that the two perform comparably across most metrics, although the ensemble method produces fewer outliers. We also compare model performance and the relative contribution of different data sources across diverse geographic, demographic and epidemic conditions.
