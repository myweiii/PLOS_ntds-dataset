Yellow fever virus (YFV) is an arbovirus transmitted to humans from mosquitoes and can lead to severe disease and death. Recent sporadic outbreaks coupled with low vaccination coverage have highlighted the importance of mosquito surveillance for preventing future outbreaks and potential virus spillover into dense urban areas. Yet, very little is known about the spatial distribution of mosquitoes known to transmit YFV and the factors that contribute to their environmental suitability in Brazil. We compiled an occurrence database of primary and secondary mosquito vectors belonging to Haemagogus and Sabethes species’ collected between 1991–2019 and integrated this data with environmental and land-use data to predict their spatial suitability at 1 km x 1 km resolution. Using this information, we identified suitable regions for their co-existence. We overlaid this information with human population density and locations of non-human primate host reservoirs to identify areas at risk of transmission and spillover. Our study provides high-resolution mapping tools to assist with mosquito and arbovirus surveillance which is especially useful in low-resource settings.
