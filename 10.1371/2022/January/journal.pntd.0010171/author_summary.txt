Yellow fever (YF) remains a significant public health risk in East Africa, however, with gaps in the transmission ecology. Important YF virus vectors include Aedes simpsoni mosquitoes that comprise subspecies with varying vectoring abilities and, poorly described ecology and biologic traits relevant to disease transmission. Through active surveillance, we analyzed the survival, human blood feeding habits and genetics of wild populations of Aedes simpsoni s.l. in two contrasting ecosystems in Kenya: peri-urban, coastal Rabai, and rural, Rift Valley Kerio Valley. Our findings reveal i) Aedes bromeliae as the most abundant subspecies in both areas exhibiting high survival rates, human blood-feeding, and potentially, high vectoring ability, ii) occurrence of Ae. lilii contrary to previous reports albeit in low numbers, iii) potential undescribed species in the group displaying human feeding tendencies. Knowledge of the locally adapted subspecies and associated traits that underlie vectorial capacity, impinges on YF distribution risk useful for guiding vector control or cost-effective vaccination.
