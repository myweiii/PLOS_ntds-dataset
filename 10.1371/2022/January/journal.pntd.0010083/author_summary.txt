Behavior change was critical to the West African Ebola epidemic response in Liberia. Previous studies show trust in the Liberian government was associated with behavior compliance, while hardships related to Ebola were associated with lower levels of trust. Trust of international non-governmental organizations (iNGOs) was consistently higher than trust in the Liberian government. However, studies have not compared exposed communities to non-exposed communities over time. This study measured trust in the government and trust in iNGOs in three communities with different exposure to the Ebola epidemic. Results corroborate that trust of iNGOs was higher than trust in the government across all five time periods. Trust decreased significantly during the peak of the Ebola crisis, especially in the community with the highest incidence. Individuals who believed that Ebola was real and had high levels of knowledge about Ebola had higher trust than those who did not. Being the frequent witness of Ebola-related events was associated with higher trust in iNGOs, but not in the government. These findings indicate that efforts to improve Ebola awareness and knowledge may positively influence trust, while exposure to the epidemic may reinforce prior mistrust of government institutions.
