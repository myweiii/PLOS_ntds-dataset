We thank the administrative and health authorities of the Golfe and Binah health districts for allowing us to carry out this study. Thanks to Ashley Heinson, University of Southampton, for his efforts in developing the heat map visualisations of scabies presentations on different body sites. We would like to pay tribute to Dr Mwelecele Ntuli Malecela who died in 2022 and was Director of the WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases; may she rest in peace.
