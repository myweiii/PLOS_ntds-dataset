Infection with Mansonella perstans remains exceedingly common in many of the worldâ€™s tropical and sub-tropical regions. However, M. perstans is largely understudied due to the long-held belief that this pathogen is of little clinical significance. However, in recent years, many within the research community have begun to advocate for the increased study of this pathogen, pointing to evidence of mansonellosis-associated disease morbidity, the potential for Mansonella spp. to confound diagnostic testing for other pathogens, and the possibility for co-infections with M. perstans to impact disease progression and treatment outcomes for other infections. As a result of this growing appreciation of the importance of M. perstans, there exists a need for improved diagnostic options, capable of providing researchers with the tools required to accurately and effectively map infection, explore the pathogen-vector relationship, and determine pathogen prevalence. In response to these needs, we have developed a novel real-time PCR assay targeting a highly repetitive DNA sequence within the M. perstans genome. This index assay outperformed a ribosomal-sequence targeting reference assay when comparatively testing both human blood and field-collected mosquito samples. As such, this assay will provide researchers with an improved tool for the identification of M. perstans as part of various operational research efforts.
