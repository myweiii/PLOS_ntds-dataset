Scabies is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The treatment and control of scabies are challenging, as there is no vaccine and the two mostly used broad-spectrum acaricides (i.e. ivermectin and permethrin) do not kill the key developmental stage (egg) of the mite that enables the re-establishment of infection. The availability of a well-assembled genome for S. scabiei now provides a foundation to explore the molecular biology, biochemistry and physiology of this mite. Here, we characterised the first somatic proteome of key developmental stages of S. scabiei using high throughput LC-MS/MS. Bioinformatic analyses of proteomic data indicate that proteins expressed differentially between egg and female adult stages are mainly involved in biological pathways or processes, such as genetic information processing, energy (oxidative phosphorylation), nucleotide, amino acid, carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism in the mite. These proteomic data should underpin further investigations of early developmental stages of S. scabiei with a focus on identifying novel intervention targets for scabies.
