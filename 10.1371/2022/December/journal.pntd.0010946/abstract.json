    "Abstract": "Presently, there is a dearth of proteomic data for parasitic mites and their relationship with the host animals. Here, using a high throughput LC-MS/MS-based approach, we undertook the first comprehensive, large-scale proteomic investigation of egg and adult female stages of the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei\u2013one of the most important parasitic mites of humans and other animals worldwide. In total, 1,761 S. scabiei proteins were identified and quantified with high confidence. Bioinformatic analyses revealed differentially expressed proteins to be involved predominantly in biological pathways or processes including genetic information processing, energy (oxidative phosphorylation), nucleotide, amino acid, carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism, and some adaptive processes. Selected, constitutively and highly expressed proteins, such as peptidases, scabies mite inactivated protease paralogues (SMIPPs) and muscle proteins (myosin and troponin), are proposed to be involved in key biological processes within S. scabiei, host-parasite interactions and/or the pathogenesis of scabies. These proteomic data will enable future molecular, biochemical and physiological investigations of early developmental stages of S. scabiei and the discovery of novel interventions, targeting the egg stage, given its non-susceptibility to acaricides currently approved for the treatment of scabies in humans."
