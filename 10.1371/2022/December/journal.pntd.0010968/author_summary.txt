If left untreated, CD evolves into a chronic oligosymptomatic infection that can progress to cardiac complications in 30% of patients after several years.
It is known that the main early marker of cardiac involvement are alterations in the conduction system. There are few studies of long-term after treatment cardiological evolution which have assessed the clinical effectiveness of treatment.
The rationale for CD treatment is to avoid the development of cardiological complications. The parasiticidal effect of treatment has been demonstrated but its clinical effectiveness in preventing cardiac involvement requires long term follow-up.
In our long term follow-up study of treated children, we observed the preventive effect on cardiac lesions by treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox. This intensifies the need for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent the development of long term complications observed in CD.
