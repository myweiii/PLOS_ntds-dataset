The transmission of both dengue and diarrheal diseases depends on water. For dengue, the mosquitoes that transmit the infection lay their eggs in containers that hold water, and this same water may contain microorganisms that cause diarrheal diseases. Improved education on these diseases in schools could help reduce their burden. In this paper we present the results of an integrated intervention on dengue and diarrhea in terms of knowledge, attitudes and practices of students, teachers and parents in 35 rural primary schools in central Colombia. The schools were randomized into four groups: interventions related to diarrheal disease alone, dengue alone, both, or neither. For two years, both educational and physical interventions to reduce risk factors were implemented. The interventions increased knowledge scores among students, their teachers and their parents for both diseases. However, the attitudes and practices components were not affected to the same extent. There was evidence that students disseminated their new knowledge about dengue to their parents, although this was not the case for diarrhea.
