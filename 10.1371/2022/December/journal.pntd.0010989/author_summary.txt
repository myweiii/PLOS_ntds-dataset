Secretory diarrheas including cholera are an important global health problem requiring new therapeutic approaches to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. In this study, we discovered that several natural statin derivatives including lipid-lowering agents inhibited cAMP-dependent chloride secretion with α,β-dehydrolovastatin (DHLV) isolated from the soil-derived fungus Aspergillus sclerotiorum PSU-RSPG178 being the most potent compound. DHLV inhibited CFTR chloride channels via mechanisms not involving alteration of intracellular cAMP levels or activation of negative regulators of CFTR functions. Furthermore, DHLV was non-toxic to intestinal epithelial cells and had no effect on Na+-K+ ATPase activities. In vivo administration of DHLV suppressed intestinal fluid secretion in a mouse closed loop model of cholera. Natural statins represent a promising class of compound candidates for the development of anti-secretory therapy of cholera.
