Human fascioliasis is a freshwater snail-transmitted disease that is widely distributed in many tropical and subtropical countries including Egypt. Recently, Upper Egypt reported sporadic cases of human fascioliasis and a few outbreaks establishing a new endemic area. This study was conducted to get information on the sociodemographic characteristics of the infected patients and possible risk factors of infection in this recently emerged endemic region. Further, this study tried to describe lymnaeid intermediate host snails involved in infection transmission morphologically and by molecular analysis. Analysis of the phylogenetic relationships between natural fasciolid populations was performed in humans, animals, and snail isolates by multilocus sequencing. Results indicated that asymptomatic fascioliasis should be screened in areas at risk of infection. Also, younger age groups and the presence of peri domestic animals were significantly associated with an increased risk of infection. This is the first molecular proof of the existence of Radix auricularia snails causing fascioliasis in Egypt. Results showed that Upper Egypt may be an area at risk for human fascioliasis that needs additional control measures.
