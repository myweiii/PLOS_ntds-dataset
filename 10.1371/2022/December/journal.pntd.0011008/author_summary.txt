Efficacy of praziquantel (PZQ) for the treatment of schistosomiasis is usually assessed by classical microscopic detection of parasite eggs in stool or urine. Due to low sensitivity, especially in case of low-intensity infections, the prevalence of infection is underestimated leading to an overestimated cure rate (CR) when using these methods. In a repeated treatment trial, the efficacy of one versus four repeated PZQ treatments, given at 2-week intervals, was investigated in school-aged children from Côte d’Ivoire by applying a range of diagnostic methods, including traditional microscopy as well as more sensitive DNA and circulating antigen detection methods. Our results demonstrate that PZQ efficacy measurements vary based on the diagnostic method used: while egg-based diagnostics (stool microscopy and DNA detection methods) show an improved CR after repeated treatment, the CR determined by worm-based diagnostics (urine circulating antigen detection methods) remained poor over time. Although all four diagnostic methods showed a significant reduction in intensity of infection already after a single treatment, more accurate antigen diagnostics revealed that, in most cases, worms remain present even after multiple treatments. Hence, using accurate diagnostic tools is essential to determine the true infection status and to monitor and evaluate treatment programs.
