Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted to humans through insects called triatomines, which feed on warm-blooded animals. Although this disease has been historically associated with the rural environment, in the last years, triatomines have been found either entering urban dwellings intrusively or colonizing urban environments of Latin American cities. In this study, we reviewed publications referring to urban Chagas that include the presence of the main vectors of this disease to find out how important the occurrence of triatomines in large cities is, which triatomine species involved are, whether or not these insects are infected with the parasite, and what the geographical distribution of the vectors and the parasite is. The results confirmed the existence of vectors in urban areas of Latin America and showed that records began to increase in the last three decades. Species of the genera Triatoma and Panstrongylus were the ones mainly recorded in the dwellings and the ones most infected with the parasite. Records of infected triatomine species have been reported from Argentina to the USA. This new scenario of Chagas disease raises the need to adapt the control of urban populations of the vectors found in these areas.
