Phlebotomus (Paraphlebotomus) sergenti is the most widespread vector of Leishmania pathogens causing anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in the old world. This paper undertook a systematic review of seasonality on a global geographical scale. This systematic analysis allowed us to identify 608 scientific papers, 35 of which 63 sites were explored in 12 countries from 1992 to December 2021. In the current review, Iran (Southern Asia) is the most influential country regarding the number of studies published on P. (Par.) sergenti seasonality with available data. Furthermore, the highest P. (Par.) sergenti activity occurs in all studied locations during the hot and dry periods (with a density that peaked during the hot season, primarily in July and August). Strikingly, we recorded a similar seasonal dynamic and geographic distribution with Phlebotomus papatasi, a proven vector of L. major causing cutaneous leishmaniasis. On a geographical scale, sites with P. (Par.) sergenti activity concentrate between 32–37° in latitude in a large interval following the longitude, with the highest number of sites with high P. (Par.) sergenti activity is located at the latitude 32°. Altogether, knowing that high P. (Par.) sergenti activity would be linked with an increased risk of leishmaniasis transmission. Our study provides information that can be used for control programs on ACL transmission.
