Trachoma is an infectious disease, experienced primarily in the developing world, and is a leading cause of global blindness. As recent efforts to address the disease have led to a significant reduction in disease prevalence, it has become difficult to train health workers to detect trachoma, due to its rarity; this if often referred to as the “last mile” problem. To address this issue, we have implemented a convolutional neural network to detect the presence of TF in images of everted eyelids. The trained network has comparable performance to trained, but non-expert, human image graders. Further, we found that misclassified images were typically characterized by poor image quality (e.g., blurry, eyelid not in image, etc.), which could be addressed by a standardization of the image acquisition protocol.
