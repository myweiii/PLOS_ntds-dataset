Elimination of onchocerciasis has been shown to be possible when ivermectin (IVM) is given continuously every year for about 15â€“17 years. However, areas where continuous IVM distribution has not achieved this objective, alternative methods are needed. Massangam health district in Cameroon is one of such areas despite more than 20 years of annual distribution. This study aimed to fast-track elimination through alternative intervention strategies (AIS). This included testing and treating those having onchocerciasis with doxycycline in communities where the infection was high, giving IVM twice a year to surrounding community members and reducing the density of flies that carry the worms by pouring chemical in river sites having fly larvae once a week for 10 weeks. The effect of these activities was measured and compared with previous data. The AIS significantly reduced the percentage of those having the disease from 35.7% to 12.3%. A 23.2% reduction was also observed with two years of AIS compared with 20.3% reduction with IVM over 15 years. Thus, AIS are practical and useful and should be considered in areas where IVM has not successfully stopped the spread of onchocerciasis.
