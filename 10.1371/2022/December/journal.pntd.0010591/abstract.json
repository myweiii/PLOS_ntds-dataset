    "Background": "Alternative strategies are recommended to accelerate onchocerciasis elimination in problematic areas including areas where annual ivermectin (IVM) distributions are unable to interrupt transmission. The aim of this study was to accelerate progress towards elimination in the Massangam health district, West Region of Cameroon where impact evaluations demonstrated ongoing transmission of onchocerciasis infection and high microfilaria (mf) prevalence despite more than 20 years of annual IVM distribution.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Parasitological, entomological, and breeding site surveys were conducted in 2015 delineating a focus of high transmission and identified three communities with high mf prevalence. Individuals in these communities were screened for mf yearly for a period of two years and those positive treated each year with doxycycline 100mg daily for five weeks. In addition, surrounding communities were given biannual IVM. Temephos-based applications were performed once a week for 10 consecutive weeks on Simulium damnosum s.l. breeding sites. Parasitological and entomological assessments were conducted after two years of implementation and findings compared with 2015 baseline. Alternative strategies accelerated progress towards elimination through a significant mf reduction (\u03c72: 40.1; p<0.001) from 35.7% (95%CI: 29.0\u201342.8) to 12.3% (95%CI, 9.0\u201316.4). Reductions were furthermore recorded over a longer period, with a reduction of prevalence of 29.0% under AIS in 2017\u20132019 compared to 14.6% with IVM in 2011\u20132015; and by 23.2% following the two years of alternative strategies compared to 20.3% reduction over 15 years of treatment with IVM (1996\u20132011). Entomological assessment demonstrates that transmission is still ongoing despite the reduction in mf which is expected in an environment with complex breeding sites and open transmission zones, i.e., where migration of flies or humans to and from neighbouring areas is common.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "This study provides evidence that alternative strategies are feasible and effective and should be considered in areas where transmission is sustained throughout long term uninterrupted MDA with IVM. However, there is need to consider wider transmission zones, and further explore optimal timing of larviciding with treatment to impact transmission."
