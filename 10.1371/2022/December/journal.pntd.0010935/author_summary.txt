Many viruses, such as dengue and Zika, are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These vector-borne diseases are a major public health problem in the tropics and sub-tropics worldwide. The primary strategy to reduce their burden is vector control, including through the application of insecticides. However, many mosquito populations have developed resistance to insecticides. Here, we present a rapid, robust, and cost-effective tool that allows the screening of genes associated with insecticide resistance across many Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, identifying known resistance and novel mutations. This assay will support vector control strategies by informing on the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance mutations across Aedes aegypti populations.
