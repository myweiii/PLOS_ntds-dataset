The SADC region is severely affected by infections such as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, which divert attention from several other diseases with major public health impacts. These critically neglected tropical diseases, include leptospirosis, cysticercosis, onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, intestinal parasites and schistosomiasis among others. Leptospirosis is often misdiagnosed as one of several other febrile diseases including malaria, brucellosis and rickettsiosis because of similarities in symptoms. It is also likely underdiagnosed because of the complexity of laboratory diagnostic methodologies. Our review found that there is a scarcity of studies on leptospirosis, and lack of standardization tools for data collection, especially in the framework of leptospirosis in people living with HIV. In this review we summarize the pooled prevalence of leptospirosis in the SADC countries and the reported circulating serovars and species of Leptospira and uncover gaps in knowledge about the epidemiology of the pathogen. Misconceptions about the prevalence of leptospirosis among the scientific community, health care providers and policy makers coupled with complexity of clinical and laboratory diagnosis have resulted in a systematic underestimation of the public health impact of this important neglected pathogen.
