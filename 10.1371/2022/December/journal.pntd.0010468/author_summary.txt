Brucellosis is a bacterial disease transmitted to humans by consumption of contaminated, unpasteurized milk or through direct contact with infected animals and their excretions. This disease causes production losses and has major economic impacts on individuals and communities. The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a metric for measuring the burden. It summarizes mortality (years of life lost) and morbidity (years lived with disability) into a single metric. This review aimed to identify existing brucellosis burden of disease studies and analyse their methodological choices, assumptions, and uncertainties. The results suggested that some parameters carry considerable uncertainty, particularly mortality and disease duration. This highlights the importance of strengthening routine reporting systems, collecting better mortality data and conducting further research on the course of brucellosis. Additionally, estimates of DALYs will benefit from a deeper understanding of the symptoms and the different sources of attribution. Finally, current reporting of methodological choices should be improved to enhance transparency, comparability, and consistency of brucellosis burden.
