Guangzhou, a city located in the south of China, is heavily affected by imported infectious disease, with frequent trade, personnel movements and unique subtropical monsoon climate which favors transmissions of various infectious diseases. In this study, we examined the epidemiological characteristics of imported cases of acute infectious diseases in Guangzhou, 2005–2019. Our findings highlighted the potential risk of spread of infectious diseases triggered by imported cases. The top three imported acute infectious diseases were dengue, malaria and influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and most of the imported cases came from Southeast Asian. The burden of dengue imported from overseas was substantial and increasing in Guangzhou, China, with the peak period from June to November. Most imported cases were males aged 20–49 years and businessmen. Further efforts, such as strengthening surveillance of imported cases, paying close attention to the epidemics in hotspots, and improving the ability to detect the imported cases from overseas, are warranted to control infectious diseases especially in the center of the city with a higher population density highly affected by imported cases.
