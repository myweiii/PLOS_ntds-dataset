Identifying the animal hosts of Ebolavirus is crucial to preventing future outbreaks. We gathered exhaustive databases of which species die and which species show evidence of past infection from ebolaviruses in published literature. Our approach allowed us to differentiate which species show high mortality from Ebolavirus and which species tolerate the infection after exposure. We found that fruit bats are likely reservoirs as they are exposed to the infection but tolerate the virus, whereas primates do not serve as ideal reservoirs because they succumb to the infection once exposed. We also compared different predictors of infection and conclude that receptors of Ebolavirus best predict infection in bats whereas ecological traits predict infection in primates.
