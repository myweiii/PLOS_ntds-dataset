Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease affecting mostly rural communities who are engaging in agricultural activities. Many studies focus on adult snakebites and very few are describing on snakebites in paediatric group. Therefore, the understanding of epidemiological and clinical profile of snakebites in children is lacking and poorly characterized. In Sri Lanka, hump-nosed pit viper (Hypnale spp.) causes the commonest venomous snakebites because it inhabits all over the country and is found frequently in human habitat. We undertook a clinical study in Teaching Hospital Ratnapura in order to describe clinical and epidemiological characteristics of HNPV bites in children.
There were 40 (56%) children with HNPV bites from which 95% (n = 38) developed local envenoming such as local pain, swelling, blistering and necrosis at the site of bite. Systemic envenoming was observed in 4 (10%) who had mild coagulopathy and 3 (7.5%) had non-specific envenoming features including abdominal pain and headache. The prominent finding was the occurrence of compartment syndrome in some children (n = 3;7.5%) who needed to open limb compartment (fasciotomy).
