Dengue is a vector-borne viral disease affecting over 100 million people globally. In Thailand, dengue is endemic, but the true estimation of the disease burden is underreported. A systematic literature search for epidemiological (2011–2019) and economic (2009–2019) studies was conducted to analyse the disease incidence, seroprevalence, serotype distribution, mortality, expansion factor, and direct and indirect costs at a country and regional level. Peak dengue incidence was highest in 2013 and 2015 and overlapped with the annual monsoon season. Children and young adults were the most affected population, with the highest case fatality rates found in young adults aged 15–24 years with dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Limited evidence indicates a high economic and societal impact of dengue. These estimates place dengue as a significant public health concern in Thailand and emphasise the need for introducing an integrated disease management programme including vaccination strategies.
