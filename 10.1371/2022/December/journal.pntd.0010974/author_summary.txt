The etiological agent of Chagas disease is the hemoflagellated protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi. The classical route of infection is via the bite of triatomine bugs. In the southern two thirds of the United States, the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) serves as a key reservoir host in the vector-borne transmission cycle of T. cruzi. Independent of the vector, Virginia opossums may maintain and transmit the parasite through vertical and alternative horizontal transmission pathways. In this study we observed vertical transmission in opossums which may amplify the natural infection prevalence. In the South American opossum species, Didelphis marsupialis, the anal gland secretions, when infected with T. cruzi, are known to cause infection in other mammalian hosts. In Virginia opossums, it is possible that this evolutionary relationship also exists; we identified T. cruzi present in anal gland secretions in the sampled Virginia opossums of Florida which may have important disease transmission implications. These findings provide evidence that the anal gland secretions of the Virginia opossum are infected with T. cruzi; however work remains to be done to determine if anal gland secretions are infectious and provide an alternative route of transmission to wildlife and potentially humans.
