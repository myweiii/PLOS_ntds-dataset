Aedes aegypti is commonly found in tropical urban areas, and is the primary vector of several serious human pathogens, including yellow fever, Zika, and dengue. As such, control of Ae. aegypti presents a pressing global public health concern, particularly in low-resource settings. Previous work has used biologically-detailed simulation models (e.g., Skeeter Buster) to predict equilibrium Ae. aegypti population dynamics over space and time. Here we present an improved model, Skeeter Buster 2 (SB2), that includes location-specific sampling and spraying events. We use SB2 to simulate, as closely as possible, two field trials of non-residual insecticidal spraying in Iquitos, Peru during 2013 and 2014. Finally, we critically assess SB2â€™s ability to predict non-equilibrium responses of Ae. aegypti populations to vector control efforts by comparing simulations and empirical observations.
Overall, we found that the effects of spraying were broadly comparable between simulated and empirical results, including rapid post-control recovery. Notably, we observed less temporal variation in simulated adult abundance than in empirical observations. Our results indicate the presence of ecological heterogeneities and/or sampling processes not captured by SB2, and suggest limits to the fine-grained predictability of Ae. aegypti population dynamics over space and time.
