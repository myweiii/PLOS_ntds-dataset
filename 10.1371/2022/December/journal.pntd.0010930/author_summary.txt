Arboviruses such as yellow fever virus (YFV) are transmitted between vertebrate hosts through mosquito bites. Beside vector control, vaccination is a preventive measure to control the spread of the disease. Until now, only the safe and effective YFV-17D live-attenuated vaccine is widely used worldwide. However, its production is fastidious and may not meet global demand in case of large yellow fever outbreaks. A next-generation live-attenuated candidate, vYF-247 grown on serum-free Vero cells, has been developed. Here we studied the infection, dissemination and transmission of vYF-247 vaccine candidate compared primarily to an YF clinical isolate S-79 and secondarily to two reference Sanofi vaccines (Stamaril and YF-VAX) in mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Although no significant conclusions could be drawn from the comparisons to the reference vaccines, we nevertheless showed that vYF-247 was unable to be transmitted by mosquitoes at the highest inoculation dose. Our study corroborates that vYF-247 adapted to growth on Vero cells has maintained YFV-17D inability to be transmitted by mosquitoes, which remains a key feature to develop a live attenuated vaccine that will be distributed to millions of subjects through vaccination campaigns.
