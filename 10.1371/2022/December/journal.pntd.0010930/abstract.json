    "Abstract": "One of the most effective vaccines against an arbovirus is the YFV-17D live-attenuated vaccine developed in 1937 against Yellow Fever (YF). This vaccine replicates poorly in mosquitoes and consequently, is not transmitted by vectors. Vaccine shortages, mainly due to constrained productions based on pathogen-free embryonated eggs, led Sanofi to move towards alternative methods based on a state-of-the-art process using continuous cell line cultures in bioreactor. vYF-247 is a next-generation live-attenuated vaccine candidate based on 17D adapted to grow in serum-free Vero cells. For the development of a new vaccine, WHO recommends to document infectivity and replication in mosquitoes. Here we infected Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes with vYF-247 vaccine compared first to the YF-17D-204 reference Sanofi vaccines (Stamaril and YF-VAX) and a clinical human isolate S-79, provided in a blood meal at a titer of 6.5 Log ffu/mL and secondly, to the clinical isolate only at an increased titer of 7.5 Log ffu/mL. At different days post-infection, virus replication, dissemination and transmission were evaluated by quantifying viral particles in mosquito abdomen, head and thorax or saliva, respectively. Although comparison of vYF-247 to reference vaccines could not be completed to yield significant results, we showed that vYF-247 was not transmitted by both Aedes species, either laboratory strains or field-collected populations, compared to clinical strain S-79 at the highest inoculation dose. Combined with the undetectable to low level viremia detected in vaccinees, transmission of the vYF-247 vaccine by mosquitoes is highly unlikely."
