Anthrax is a bacterial disease, cause by Bacillus anthracis, that can transmit from herbivorous animals to humans through close contact, eating meat of infected animals, or through environmental contamination. Anthrax can be a severe disease requiring early diagnosis and treatment to avoid fatal outcomes, disability, or financial burden to patients and their families. The disease also affects human well-being when livestock is their livelihood and an important part in agricultural practice. Anthrax is preventable by vaccine but effective strategy for vaccine distribution should be built on the characteristics of the disease in both human communities and the local animal populations. This study provides evidence on the space-time distribution and other characteristics of anthrax applying a One Health approach and geographical information analysis techniques. We show that hotspots of human disease correspond to areas of animal case reporting. We also show human incidence is reduced with livestock vaccination rates are relatively high. The study results are useful for researchers to foster investigation on other aspects of the disease and control efforts. It also provides scientific evidence for advocacy and communication on the importance of anthrax vaccination and strategic planning on vaccine production and distribution in Vietnam and other countries with similar context.
