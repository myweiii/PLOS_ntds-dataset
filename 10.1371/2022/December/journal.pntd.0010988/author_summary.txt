Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is usually transmitted by ticks or contact with viremic animal tissues (animal tissue where the virus has entered the bloodstream) during and immediately after post-slaughter of animals and can lead to epidemics, has a high case fatality ratio (10–40%), potentially results in hospital and health facility outbreaks, and is difficult to prevent and treat. The number of CCHF infections increases around Eid-ul-Adha as more livestock is moved from rural areas to cities during Eid-ul-Adha. In Pakistan, the current national control program has been unable to eliminate CCHF on its own. Therefore, sociocultural and behavioral research can inform and improve the impact of future control programs. To this end, we investigated knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to CCHF in general population of Pakistan. We alarmingly found low levels of disease knowledge and attitudes and practices. Preventive interventions are uncommon due to poor infrastructure, a lack of education, and restricted access to health care and livestock-related facilities. It is high time that Pakistan’s health, agriculture, and media sectors collaborate with international organizations to establish and implement a strategic framework for CCHF awareness and prevention. This kind of social context is vital to future public health campaigns, and highlights the importance of cross-disciplinary work to achieve successful disease control.
