Mass drug administration (MDA) of antifilarial drugs is the main strategy towards the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF), but defining when MDA can safely be stopped is challenging. Current stopping guidelines require that the prevalence of microfilaraemia (Mf) in the population falls below 1% or the prevalence of circulating filarial antigenaemia (CFA) in 6-and-7-year-old children falls below 2%. The evidence base underlying this threshold is limited. The accuracy of this threshold is hard to assess in field studies due to the long timespan between stopping MDA and the occurrence of either elimination or resurgence. We used mathematical modelling to assess how well elimination can be predicted at community-level from the Mf or CFA prevalence observed 1-year after the last MDA round and we determined safe stopping thresholds (>95% certainty that elimination is achieved). We found that the currently used CFA prevalence in 6â€“7 year-old children is a poor indicator for stopping decisions in LF elimination programmes implementing MDA with ivermectin plus albendazole, and that CFA prevalence among people aged 5 or 15 years and older is a much more reliable and practical indicator of elimination outcomes. Lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes should reconsider guidelines for stopping MDA.
