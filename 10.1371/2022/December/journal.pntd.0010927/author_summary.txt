Buruli ulcer is a bacterial skin disease, which is endemic in West and Central Africa. The disease mostly affects children and can progress to large lesions primarily located on upper and lower limbs. While current evidence suggests that the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium ulcerans, is hosted in aquatic environments, the exact transmission route is still not clear. In our study, we investigated two endemic villages in the south-central part of Côte d’Ivoire. Framed in a larger research initiative, we mapped households and water sources of Buruli ulcer cases. Additionally, we interviewed people with Buruli ulcer as well as health care workers about water contact patterns and perceived risk factors. Despite drilled wells installed in the villages, the nearby river (Bandama), seasonal ponds, and low-lands are key water resources for the residents. Our research revealed a variety of activities where people get in touch with water that are related to domestic and subsistence work. Environmental, social, and cultural risk factors were mentioned, underlining the complexity on the local level. We conclude that the communities’ perspective and their knowledge must be considered in future research to reduce the burden of Buruli ulcer and other neglected tropical diseases.
