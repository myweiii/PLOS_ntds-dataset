Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection is a serious public health problem that can cause various clinical manifestations of infection, including NTM-pulmonary lung disease (NTM-PD). NTM-PD infections are often misdiagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis, leading to underestimation of the incidence of NTM infections, particularly in countries where tuberculosis is endemic. The lack of routine laboratory services in Indonesia in terms of species identification and susceptibility to NTM is a factor complicating diagnosis and patient management. These factors have led to a lack of adequate information on NTM infections in Indonesia. Research on species identification and susceptibility testing is important to help clinicians better manage NTM infections. This study was conducted on 94 clinical isolates of NTM from Java Province, and it is the first study in Indonesia to identify NTM to the species level using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The most common species found were M. fortuitum group and M. abscessus. M. abscessus was more resistant to ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline than M. fortuitum group. Amikacin is the most effective antibiotic and can be used as the empirical antibiotic of choice.
