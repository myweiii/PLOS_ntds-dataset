Mosquitoes are important globally, spreading viral diseases worldwide. Chikungunya virus causes epidemics of disease in people. Here we have investigated using two types of small RNAs and pathways inherent in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to target a piece of the chikungunya virusâ€™s genome, potentially preventing viral replication. We express these small RNAs using a pre-miRNA-1 based system, inserted into the intron within a commonly used promoter. We have used reporter systems in cell lines which can give preliminary indications of how these systems might work in mosquitoes. Our results indicate that short-hairpin-like designs are more effective than micro-RNA-like designs at knocking down expression of their targets. This knock-down requires Dcr-2 indicating that the short-hairpin-like RNAs are likely using the endo-siRNA pathway to degrade mRNA which contains their complementary RNA.
