School-based de-worming is used to reduce soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections among children. However, re-infection occurs rapidly. The Mikono Safi trial focused on enabling and motivating children to wash their hands at key times, with the aim to reduce the proportion of children with STH infection. Parents/guardians invited to participate in parental engagement activities at school as part of the trial, were given information on how STHs can be avoided through improved handwashing practices at school and at home. To assess the effect on parental engagement activities, we conducted 20 qualitative interviews with parents/guardians and WASH observation in 20 households. We found that the engagement activities were successful in increasing parents’/guardians’ concern about STH infection in their children, which in turn led them to improve handwashing opportunities and practices in the home. However, not all households had improved handwashing facilities at home or ensured that water and soap was available.
