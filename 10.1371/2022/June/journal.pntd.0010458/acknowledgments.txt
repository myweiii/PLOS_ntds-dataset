The authors would like to thank all lab workers and data managers who significantly contributed to ensure the implementation of field work. Likewise, to all logistic staff involved (drivers, mobilizers) who supported daily field activities. The authors also acknowledge all the Provincial and Municipal authorities support to the implementation of this mapping and, to Education and Health departments at provincial and district level who facilitated all contacts and, in the vast majority of the cases provided housing for field teams in remote settings. A major appreciation should also be given to all School Directors and teachers that contributed in a very positive way to make this mapping happen as they played a major role in mobilizing parents and children to enrol in the mapping. Finally, the authors would like to thank all parents and children engaged in the mapping for their vital contribution to better understand neglected tropical diseases in Angola.
