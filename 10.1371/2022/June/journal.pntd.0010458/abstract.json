    "Introduction": "Schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil transmitted helminthiases (STH) have been historically recognized as a major public health problem in Angola. However, lack of reliable, country wide prevalence data on these diseases has been a major hurdle to plan and implement programme actions to target these diseases. This study aimed to characterize SCH and STH prevalence and distribution in Angola.",
    "Methods": "A country wide mapping was conducted in October 2018 (1 province) and from July to December 2019 (14 provinces) in school aged (SAC) children in 15 (of 18) provinces in Angola, using WHO protocols and procedures. A total of 640 schools and an average of 50 students per school (N = 31,938 children) were sampled. Stool and urine samples were collected and processed using the Kato-Katz method and Urine Filtration. Prevalence estimates for SCH and STH infections were calculated for each province and district with 95% confidence intervals. Factors associated with SCH and STH infection, respectively, were explored using multivariable logistic regression accounting for clustering by school.",
    "Results": "Of the 131 districts surveyed, 112 (85.5%) are endemic for STH, 30 (22.9%) have a prevalence above 50%, 24 (18.3%) are at moderate risk (prevalence 20%-50%), and 58 (44.3%) are at low risk (<20% prevalence); similarly, 118 (90,1%) of surveyed districts are endemic for any SCH, 2 (1.5%) are at high risk (>50% prevalence), 59 (45.0%) are at moderate risk (10%-50% prevalence), and 57 (43.5%) are at low risk (<10% prevalence). There were higher STH infection rates in the northern provinces of Malanje and Lunda Norte, and higher SCH infection rates in the southern provinces of Benguela and Huila.",
    "Conclusions": "This mapping exercise provides essential information to Ministry of Health in Angola to accurately plan and implement SCH and STH control activities in the upcoming years. Data also provides a useful baseline contribution for Angola to track its progress towards the 2030 NTD roadmap targets set by WHO."
