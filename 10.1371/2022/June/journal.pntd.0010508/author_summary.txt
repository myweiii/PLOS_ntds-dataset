There are puzzling contradictions between reported risk factors for cryptosporidiosis and for paediatric diarrhoea in general. We suspected that these differences are more related to different methodological approaches rather than real differences in the underlying epidemiology. To address this, we applied several epidemiological tools that, to our knowledge, have not previously been combined in a risk-factor analysis for cryptosporidiosis: 1) an underlying conceptual framework 2) the use of pragmatic “real-life” inclusion criteria, 3) quantitative cutoffs for case ascertainment, and 4) a case-case-control design, to allow side-by-side comparison of risk factors for cryptosporidiosis and non-cryptosporidiosis diarrhoea. Caregiver-related socioeconomic factors, public-tap water use, previous healthcare attendance, and moderate acute malnutrition were apparently more strongly associated with cryptosporidiosis than with non-cryptosporidiosis diarrhoea. Our results suggest giving priority to nutritional management of moderate acute malnutrition and exploring healthcare-initiated interventions, with focused caregiver education and closer follow-up of children who present for healthcare or have acute malnutrition, in order to prevent or ameliorate outcomes of future episodes of cryptosporidiosis.
