Yellow fever virus (YFV) is the etiological agent of yellow fever (YF), a hemorrhagic disease endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical regions of South America. Due to the threat YF poses to public health, a single case of constitutes an outbreak, making accurate diagnosis paramount. Viremia during YFV infection is variable and may be quite low depending on disease severity and the timing of sample collection. In addition, viral RNA is highly liable, especially in the hot and humid conditions that accompany YFV transmission season. To reduce RNA degradation, clinical samples are transported to diagnostic laboratories via cold chain. As cold chain is not always reliable or available, the capacity of certain regions to perform the molecular diagnosis of yellow fever is stunted, leading to a delay in diagnosis and outbreak management. Here we optimized a protocol for the incorporation of Whatman FTA cards into the YF molecular diagnostic with the goal of producing a cold chain-independent viral RNA stabilization method. These cards are compact, easy to use and were shown to inactivate YFV and stabilize YFV RNA at high temperature and humidity. The implementation of this protocol in endemic regions could aid in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of YF.
