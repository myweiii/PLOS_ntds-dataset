Hookworm disease is endemic in China. The national surveillance system on important parasitic diseases including hookworm infection has been established in China. Stool samples were collected from participants, and the Kato-Katz method was applied to detect helminth eggs while samples with hookworm eggs were further cultured to differentiate the species of the parasite. Additionally, soil samples were collected and examined for hookworm larva. In 2019, the overall infection rate of hookworm in China was 0.85% (3580/424766). High prevalence was demonstrated in Western and Southern China, including Sichuan (4.75%), Chongqing (2.54%) and Hainan (2.44%). The prevalence was high in the females (0.71%) than in the males (0.61%), while it was high in older population especially those age over 60 years. N. americanus dominated the hookworm species. The prevalence of hookworm in soil was 3.45%. Overally, hookworm infection decreased to a low level in China. However, there still exist high endemic areas. Thus, intervention needs to be applied in the high endemic areas and elder population.
