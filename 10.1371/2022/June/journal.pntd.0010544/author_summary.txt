Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease, that affects the poorest of the poor in low and middle-income countries. It is caused by a parasite, Leishmania, that is transmitted during the blood meal of an insect. When individuals cannot control Leishmania replication, they develop visceral leishmaniasis, that is characterised by enlarged spleen and liver, low blood cell counts and wasting. We have previously shown that lymphocytes from these patients have an impaired ability to produce a soluble mediator, IFNγ, that contribute to the killing of the parasites, but that this was restored after successful anti-leishmanial treatment. Here we identified high expression levels of a marker, PD1, on lymphocyte; that has been associated with dysfunctional lymphocytes. We also identified the ligands of this marker, PDL1, on different blood cells. Furthermore, we showed that blocking the interaction between PD1 and PDL1 resulted in increased levels of IFNγ. These results suggest that treatment that blocks the interaction of PD1 with PDL1 might improve disease management and patient care.
