Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with high case-fatality rate and lack of vaccines, calling for an urgent need to identify the risk factors of mortality. Compared to the previous studies concentrating on clinical manifestations diagnosed partly relying on empirical subjective assessment, our study aimed to systematically analyzed the association between SFTS patients’ outcomes and clinical laboratory parameters. What’s more, no consistent conclusion derived because of sample sizes with enormous differences. In this systematic review, we searched the medical literature and found 34 studies evaluating associations between laboratory factors and risk of dying among SFTS patients. These studies described 3388 SFTS patients of whom 739 (21.81%) died. SFTS patients were at increased risk of dying if they had abnormal strongly levels of viral load, PLT, coagulation function and liver function. Therefore, the patients with above-mentioned situations should be monitored and cured carefully.
