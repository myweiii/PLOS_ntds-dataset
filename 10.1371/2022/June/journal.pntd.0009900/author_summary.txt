The incidence of venereal syphilis has greatly increased in the last years, however endemic syphilis (bejel) which have been considered as a disease restricted to dry arid areas such as the Sahel and the Middle East, remain as a neglected disease. In Cuba, which is a tropical country, several bejel cases were unexpectedly detected few years ago in “syphilis” patients with no records of travel abroad or sex with foreign partners. In this study, we explored the whole genome sequences from four of the Cuban Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum (TEN) isolates and the substantial genetic diversity detected among them suggests a persistent infection of TEN within the human population rather than a single outbreak of a TEN isolate introduced from an area where it is typically endemic. This finding has significant implications on this neglected and also possibly tropical disease in terms of geographical/temporal distribution, and highlights the importance of keeping in mind neglected diseases in apparently non-endemic areas.
