Worldwide, over one million people are getting infected by the parasitic flagellates of the genus Leishmania annually leading to ~30,000 deaths. Notably, there is still no approved vaccine against human leishmaniases. A range of methods of forward and reverse genetics has recently been developed for several model Leishmania species. Unfortunately, these methods are often not transferrable to non-model species, which may be of even greater medical importance. Leishmania guyanensis is one of such cases. It frequently carries a symbiotic RNA virus that contributes to the development of a more aggressive form of leishmaniasis in an experimental murine model. In order to establish and optimize the system for genetic manipulations in L. guyanensis, we sequenced and annotated its genome. Next, we applied the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to target a gene of interest. This approach was validated by ablating a gene encoding a protein involved in lipid metabolism. In this work, we document that deletion of this gene leads to the disturbance of cell cycle and affects the ratio of critical intracellular lipids. We believe that our study will facilitate research into more effective treatment of leishmaniases.
