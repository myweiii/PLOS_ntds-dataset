We assessed baseline seroprevalence and risk factors for previous CHIKV or recent ZIKV infection among 4,035 participants in the Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses (COPA) study. Participants were recruited among people 1â€“50 years old living in 38 study clusters in the Ponce municipality of southern Puerto Rico. Among 4,035 participants, 31% had evidence of previous CHIKV infection, and 16% had evidence of recent ZIKV infection. For both viruses, older age was associated with greater risk for infection; male sex was also associated with higher rates of ZIKV infection. Seroprevalence varied by study cluster, with similar patterns between the two viruses. Home screens and air conditioning in the home were significant protective factors against infection in the multivariate analysis for both CHIKV and ZIKV.
