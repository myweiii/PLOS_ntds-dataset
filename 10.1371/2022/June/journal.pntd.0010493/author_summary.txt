Vaccines might be a crucial component of the current efforts to malaria control and elimination, and much of the vaccine-related research on P. vivax has been focused on region II of the Duffy binding protein (DBPII), a ligand for human blood-stage infection. Recently, the newly described Erythrocyte binding protein 2 (EBP2), a P.vivax DBP paralog that it is antigenically distinct from DBP, was identified as potential vaccine targets. To date, scarce data are available about the naturally acquired immunity to EBP2. In a small outbreak of P.vivax malaria, located in a non-malarious area, we investigated whether a first P.vivax exposure induces antibodies against EBP2 that could be boosted by P.vivax recurrent infections. In parallel, we included an engineered DBPII vaccine (named DEKnull-2) whose antibody response were previously associated with broadly neutralizing P.vivax antibodies. This study shows EBP2, compared with DEKnull-2, was poorly immunogenic among individuals who experienced their first blood-stage P. vivax malaria infection. However, EBP2 was highly immunogenic in long-term malaria exposed individuals, reinforcing its potential as a P. vivax blood-stage vaccine candidate. Finally, our results reinforce that multiple blood-stage antigens should be targeted for the development of efficient vaccines against P. vivax.
