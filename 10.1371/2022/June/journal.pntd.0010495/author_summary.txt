Conventional pit latrines do not fully isolate fecal pathogens and in many settings, pits are emptied manually, and pit contents released into water bodies and fields. Sand barriers installed around the latrine pit can help reduce contamination but can also alter the decomposition of the fecal sludge. We evaluated whether a sand barrier effectively contains STH ova within the pit and whether it alters the decomposition processes of pit contents and/or accelerates pit fill-up. C/N ratio was significantly higher in latrines without a sand barrier and approached the preferable range for optimal decomposition. Pit latrines with sand barriers filled up more rapidly and were emptied more often. No households in either arm used any protective measure when emptying the pits. Larvated STH ova counts were similar in the latrines with vs. without sand barriers while non-larvated ova counts were higher in pits with a sand barrier. The lower C/N ratio and quicker filling up of latrines with sand barriers indicate that pit contents are more likely to be infective at the time of pit emptying, necessitating safe emptying and disposal methods. Latrines with and without sand barrier had similar loading into the pit by infected individuals. Enveloping latrine pits with a sand layer helped contain helminth ova within the pits, allowing time for them to become non-viable and potentially reducing the spread of viable ova into the surrounding environment.
