Little is known, across the world, about of tuberculosis in humans caused by Mycobacterium bovis, ie, zoonotic tuberculosis (zTB). Insufficient data are a major challenge for developing strategies for the control of zTB, in particular in low-income and middle-income countries. Surveillance data are essential to develop effective TB control strategies, quantifying disease burden, and identifying risk factors and vulnerable groups. Strengthening the One Health approach is essential for making zoonotic disease control strategies highly effective by promoting concerted actions across human and animal health programs and integrated surveillance. A systematic review was conducted to describe existing zTB surveillance and the degree of its coordination with animal TB surveillance in countries of low-income, middle- and high-income, accounting for the country risk of M. bovis transmission. We found that zTB surveillance is highly conditioned by countryâ€™s income level, and identified a discrepancy between the level of risk of animal-human TB transmission and the extent of surveillance. In addition, less than 5% of the countries assessed have implemented integrated human and animal TB control programs, which suggests low adoption of the One Health approach across the world. Without adequate surveillance for zTB, across the world, it will be unlikely to guarantee diagnosis and treatment for all TB patients.
