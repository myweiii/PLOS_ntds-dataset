Studies of Salmonella Typhi (the cause of typhoid fever) rarely include isolates collected both before and after the interruption of hyperendemic transmission because this typically occurred decades before modern bacteria preservation methods. After substantial reduction in disease, it was assumed that sporadic cases and infrequent outbreaks were due to either chronic biliary carriers or importations, but this was difficult to characterize with low resolution bacterial typing methods. In Santiago, Chile, typhoid fever persisted at hyperendemic levels through the 1980s until organized control efforts in the 1980s and changes to wastewater policy in 1991 caused annual typhoid incidence to plummet.
In this study, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate whether recent sporadic cases occurring in Santiago in the 2010s were genomically similar to S. Typhi circulating in the 1980s, or dissimilar, possibly representing importations of S. Typhi from outside of Chile. We found concordance amongst S. Typhi genotypes between the 1980s and 2010s, and differences from genotypes circulating in Southeast Asia and Africa where typhoid remains hyperendemic. Our findings suggest that a proportion of modern, rare typhoid cases in Santiago are autochthonous, and that chronic carriers or another unknown reservoir likely contribute. Broadly, our findings corroborate the epidemiologic importance of long-term reservoirs of typhoid fever decades after typhoid elimination.
