Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its 2021â€“2030 road map for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). While diagnostics are clearly pivotal to steer the NTD endemic countries towards the ambitious targets set, the current gap in the global diagnostic armamentarium for NTDs once more becomes painfully apparent. As most NTD programs mainly rely on microscopic examination of slides, automation of slide scanning coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to close this diagnostic gap by 2030. Therefore, we developed a device to automate scanning of stool smears and deployed it in four endemic countries to build an image data base for both intestinal and blood-dwelling worms. After the images were annotated, we used 90% to train and 10% to validate an AI model. As the AI model was able to reliably recognise worm eggs, we provided a proof-of-concept for automated scanning and detection of worm eggs in stool smears. We identified important obstacles for both the slide scanning device and the application of AI, but we are hopeful that this research can support the 2030 NTDs roadmap and eventually other NTDs for which microscopic examination is the diagnostic standard.
