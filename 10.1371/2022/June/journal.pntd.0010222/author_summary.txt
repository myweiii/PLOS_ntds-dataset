Gambian human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense transmitted by tsetse flies (Glossina). Ugandaâ€™s strategy to eliminate gHAT includes the deployment of Tiny Targets, comprising insecticide-treated panels of cloth which attract and kill tsetse. Our data from a network of monitoring traps assessed how increasing the intervention area from ~250 km2 to ~1600 km2 affected the degree of control. Inspection of deployed targets indicated their effective lifespan. Targets reduced tsetse abundance by >80% beside the rivers where they were deployed but had no clear effect on adjacent rivers where targets were absent. As the intervention area increased, so did the extent of the area controlled. We did not deploy targets along the smaller rivers so that, as expected, the tsetse population was not eliminated. Our findings suggest that the population was sustained at low levels by invasion of tsetse from untreated parts of the drainage system. The average effective life of targets was ~60 days as against the ~180 days for targets deployed in Kenya. This discrepancy is attributable, in part, to the Uganda targets being removed by seasonal floods. While the level of control achieved is already more than sufficient to interrupt transmission of gHAT, even better control would be achieved by increasing the coverage of the drainage system.
