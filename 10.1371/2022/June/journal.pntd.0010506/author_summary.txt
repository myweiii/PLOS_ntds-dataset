Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease that occurs in almost all regions of the world, with a particularly high burden of disease in Oceania. It is widely considered to be a Neglected Zoonotic Disease, and it is often mis-diagnosed and under-ascertained. Very little information exists about the persistence of antibodies to leptospirosis, which is important for understanding how long individuals may have partial protection against reinfection. In this study, we show how data collected from a large population survey of leptospirosis antibodies can be used to estimate the duration of antibody persistence. Knowledge of the duration of antibody persistence enables an estimation of the duration of immunity to re-infection, which is most likely antibody-mediated. We also estimate the rate at which susceptible individuals acquire infection (force of infection), whilst accounting for antibody waning. This provides more accurate estimates of population-wide disease burden. Finally, we show how the results from a cross-sectional population survey can be used to estimate when infections may have occurred. This is particularly useful in areas with limited surveillance. This approach could be applied to other neglected diseases for which data are limited and where antibody waning occurs.
