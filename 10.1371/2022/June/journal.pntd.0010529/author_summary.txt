Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a severe systemic mycosis caused by inhalation of fungi belonging to the genus Paracoccidioides present in the soil of endemic areas in Latin America. However, it is still a neglected disease, affecting vulnerable populations such as rural workers. In the last decade, there was an increase of acute PCM cases in young people living in urban areas of the endemic area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This could increase the occurrence of PCM in people living HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) because they are more concentrated in these regions. When PCM and immunosuppression due to AIDS occur simultaneously, PCM can present as an opportunistic disease, with more severe, invasive, and atypical presentations. In these cases, late diagnosis and treatment can lead to higher risk of complications, sequelae, and deaths. PCM occurrence in PLWHA is scarcely reported in the literature. This study aims to describe the clinical profile of patients diagnosed with PCM and HIV co-infection from a 30-year historical cohort followed at a Brazilian reference center for infectious diseases. Our results revealed that the suspicion of this co-infection in patients with more severe clinical forms of PCM as well as routine HIV testing in PCM patients could help to prevent late-onset treatment and progression to unfavorable outcomes.
