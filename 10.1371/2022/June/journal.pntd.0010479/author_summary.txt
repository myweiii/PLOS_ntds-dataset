The theoretical importance of the El Ni単o Southern Oscillation to infectious disease transmission is widely accepted, however few studies have quantified this effect or its interaction with local environment. Using surveillance data on outbreaks of dengue fever in Peru, we have found evidence that El Ni単o events increase the risk of dengue outbreaks in the high jungle and coast, and decrease this risk in the low jungle. Our findings are likely generalizable to other viruses which are, like dengue virus, are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, including Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. As climate change is expected to increase the frequency of El Ni単o events, these results indicate that arbovirus outbreaks may also increase, and that El Ni単o events may be leveraged to predict them.
