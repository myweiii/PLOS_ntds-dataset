Parasitic worms and Plasmodium falciparum, the causal agent of malaria, are among the most relevant parasitic diseases of our time and efforts are under way for their control and, ultimately, elimination. An accurate diagnosis is relevant for case management, but also allows calculating the prevalence and evaluating the effectiveness of treatment and control measures. Unfortunately, current diagnostic methods for parasitic worms are not optimal and many infections remain undetected. As for P. falciparum, current diagnostic techniques are satisfactory but do not allow for ascertaining exposure, which is relevant for evaluating control measures. Here we investigated the utility of measuring antibodies to these parasites as a diagnostic method. Our results indicate that it is possible to detect current infection with parasitic worms and P. falciparum using antibody detection with a moderate to high accuracy. We also show that antibodies against the antigens in this study have potential as markers of exposure. Importantly, we used a platform that allows for the simultaneous detection of immunoglobulins to different parasites, which would be extremely useful as a tool to integrate control and elimination programs for several pathogens.
