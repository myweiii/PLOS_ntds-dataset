Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, caused by dengue virus (DENV) of the Flaviviridae family has been the source of a global epidemic for decades, and it has recently spread to all parts of the globe. Hemorrhagic manifestations in dengue are caused by increased vascular permeability and thrombocytopenia (150K cells/L). GATA1 is considered to be the master transcription factor for regulating the differentiation and maturation of megakaryocytes (MKs). The exonic polymorphism landscape of hematopoietic transcription factorâ€”GATA1 in dengue patients was investigated in our study to see if there is an association between genetic variations and thrombocytopenia. Out of the 13 variations identified, variants G>A (chX:48792009) and C>A (chX:4879118) had the highest frequencies. Patients harboring either nonsynonymous or synonymous variants had significantly lower mean platelet counts compared to those having wild-type nucleotides. We have identified new GATA1 gene variations that were proven to be clinically related to the outcome of dengue patients and hence holds the potential to be candidate biomarkers for determining the severity and prognosis of dengue thrombocytopenia. However, this study needs to be replicated in a large number of dengue patients.
