In both humans and animals, microbiomes are known to influence general health. Recently, several human studies demonstrated that intestinal helminth infections enhanced both the abundance and diversity of gut microbiomes, which may prevent the host from developing inflammatory diseases. Gastrointestinal helminth infections are considered to predominantly impact on the local microbiome of the host gut. Microbiome remodelling in other, more distant, parts of the body as a result of helminth infection has not been investigated. Here we characterized the alteration of host gut microbiota during infection with major gastrointestinal helminth species including, O. viverrini, hookworm, A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura in rural populations of Thailand. The data indicate that helminth infections, including O. viverrini, altered the abundance of specific bacterial taxa in the host gut but not overall bacterial diversity. In contrast, the saliva microbiota displayed both altered bacterial richness and abundance during active helminth infections. To our knowledge, these data provide the first evidence that intestinal helminth infections may alter not only the host gut microbiota, but also influence microbial communities in other, more peripheral, regions including the saliva.
