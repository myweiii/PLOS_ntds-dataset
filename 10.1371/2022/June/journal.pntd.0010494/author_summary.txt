Rabies is a fatal viral disease that affects the nervous system. It is endemic in many countries in Africa and Asia where free roaming dogs form a reservoir. Transmission to humans occurs most often through a dog bite. However, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), if administered before symptom onset, is highly effective at preventing the disease. In Cambodia, a few number of centers offer PEP, with the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge in Phnom Penh being the main one. These few locations lead to limited accessibility for rural areas distant from Phnom Penh and underestimations of the dog-bite burden and PEP needs. Through statistical modelling, we measured the impact of accessibility on the number of PEP patients and predicted the impact of opening new centers in other locations. We found that travel time was significantly associated with the rate of PEP patients. IPC opened new rabies centers in Battambang and Kampong Cham provinces in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and we identified four provinces where future openings would be the most beneficial: Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap, Takeo, Kampot and Svay Rieng. This study is part of a broader drive to eradicate rabies in Cambodia by 2030 through increased PEP infrastructure and control measures in the dog population.
