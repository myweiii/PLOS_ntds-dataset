Chagas disease affects millions of people worldwide. In the Southern Cone, the development of pyrethroid resistant populations from T. infestans is related to vector persistence and affects the efficiency of vector control campaigns. Several studies have explored the causes of insecticide resistance in T. infestans populations. However, the global transcriptomic response after insecticide treatment has not been analyzed in any strain or natural population of this species so far. In this study, we obtained transcriptomic information which allowed us to characterize important gene families despite the absence of an annotated genome. Furthermore, we performed a quantitative analysis of gene expression after deltamethrin intoxication in a low resistant population. The results provided here increase the knowledge on detoxification processes in vectors of Chagas disease, which is essential for the design of new vector control strategies.
