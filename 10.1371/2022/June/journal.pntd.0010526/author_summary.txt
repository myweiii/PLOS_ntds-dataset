Hantaviruses (family Hantaviridae, genus Hantavirus) are rodent viruses that can cause two fatal human diseasesâ€”hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. These viruses are transmitted by various rodent species such as Apodemus agrarius. In the present study, wild rodents captured in the suburbs of Gwangju Metropolitan City were analyzed by nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting the hantavirus-specific L segment and indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay using Hantaan virus antigen slides. A total of 585 wild rodents were captured and 1.88% (11/585) of all rodents, 1.17% (6/512) of A. agrarius, 6.12% (3/49) of Crocidura lasiura, and 8.33% (2/24) of Myodes regulus were PCR-positive. Of the eleven PCR-positive wild rodents, six PCR products showed over 85% sequence similarity with the Jeju virus, four showed over 99.7% similarity with the Hantaan virus, and one showed over 95.3% homology with the Imjin virus. Moreover, IgG antibodies against the Hantaan virus were detected in 6.15% (36/585) of all rodents, 6.8% (35/512) of A. agrarius, and 4.17% (1/24) of M. regulus. IgG antibodies were not detected in C. lasiura. When we examined the detection rate of hantavirus genes in different seasons, hantaviruses were most commonly detected in fall (seven cases [5.69%]) and winter (four cases [2.76%]). No hantaviruses were detected in spring or summer. However, the seasonal prevalence of IgG antibodies was higher in spring and summer (12 [7.32%] and 11 [7.10%] cases, respectively) than in fall and winter (seven [5.69%] and six [4.14%] cases, respectively). This study was performed on a monthly basis throughout a three-year period, and thus, it provides reliable data that may provide insight into preventive measures against HFRS. Our results suggest that various types of hantaviruses, including Hantaan, Jeju, and Imjin viruses, are distributed throughout Gwangju Metropolitan City, South Korea. Data regarding the rate of Hantaan virus infection in rodents in Gwangju and knowledge of the hantavirus seroprevalence, species, and genotypes circulating in these domestic rodent species will provide useful information for developing vaccines and diagnostic testing using sequence data. These will help increase preparedness for the emergence of new species.
