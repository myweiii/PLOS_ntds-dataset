Lymphatic filariasis (LF), the cause of elephantiasis, and onchocerciasis, the cause of river blindness, are Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) prioritised for elimination as a public health problem. New drugs which cure filarial infection are required to accelerate elimination of these diseases. There is a lack of drug screening systems to accurately assess treatment efficacy of new candidate drugs, particularly for LF. Here we describe new methods to grow large yields of the causative agent of lymphatic filariasis, Brugia malayi, in selective immune-deficient mice and maintain female parasites outside of the body, in combination with a bi-layer of lymphatic endothelial cells, for periods of up to 3 weeks without loss of viability. We demonstrate the application of this system to test the efficacy of reference and experimental drug compounds including drugs targeting the filarial symbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia. The novel production and maintenance of female B. malayi described here will have useful future applications to more accurately determine candidates for onward clinical testing as new filariasis cures whilst reducing animal use, costs, and drug development time-frames.
