Insecticide resistance is a major impediment to the successful management of vector-transmitted diseases because it increases the vectorâ€™s chances of surviving under insecticide treatment. In Indonesia, the implementation of insecticide resistance management at the national level is particularly challenging due to the vast area and regional disparities in terms of population, health, and socioeconomic status. Previous studies on determining insecticide resistance of Aedes mosquito only focused on several cities in some provinces of Indonesia, making resistance monitoring results difficult to interpret and arguably reflect the generality in Indonesia. To complicate the matter, data released by the Ministry of Agriculture of Indonesia in 2022 showed that approximately 82% of insecticides registered to control Ae. aegypti in Indonesia are pyrethroid-based products. Principally, we found that the synergists PBO and DEF significantly reduce the resistance of field Ae. aegypti from Indonesia toward permethrin and deltamethrin. Bendiocarb and pirimiphos-methyl remain highly toxic to the field strains of Ae. aegypti. We suggest the feasible choice of insecticide group for Ae. aegypti vector management based on the currently registered insecticide inventory. The finding also underscores the urgent need to approve other non-pyrethroid-based insecticides as alternative tools for reducing the risk of resistance development during an outbreak.
