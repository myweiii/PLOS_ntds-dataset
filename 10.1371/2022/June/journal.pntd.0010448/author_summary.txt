Cryptococcus is the most common cause of meningitis among adults in South Africa. Most human disease is caused by the members of two species complexes within the genus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. The environmental range of these species complexes, both found in soil, overlaps in southern Africa though C. gattii is a less common human pathogen. C. gattii is divided into six molecular types: VGI, VGII, VGIII, VGIV, VGV and VGVI. In earlier molecular epidemiology studies including relatively few isolates, most southern African isolates were confirmed as molecular type VGIV. We aimed to determine the molecular diversity of C. gattii in South Africa by genotyping patient isolates obtained through laboratory surveillance, 2005â€“2013. We confirmed that VGIV was the dominant molecular type and that HIV-seropositive patients were more likely to be infected with VGIV compared to those HIV-seronegative. Analysis of the genomes of South African VGIV isolates revealed that they spanned the whole VGIV clade and confirmed that most isolates did not cluster specifically. However, we observed two interesting clusters of closely related isolates, consisting of patients from three neighbouring provinces in South Africa, suggesting a similar environmental source. Further studies of clinical and environmental African C. gattii isolates are needed to gain a better understanding of this pathogen.
