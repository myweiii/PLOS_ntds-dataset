Rift valley fever (RVF) is an important mosquito borne disease of humans and ruminants. RVF is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa where disease outbreaks are frequently reported in humans and animals. For RVF outbreaks to occur, there has to be presence of the host (animals or humans) and favorable climatic conditions that favor emergence of RVF virus vectors (mosquitoes). Understanding this complex interaction enables us to predict future disease outbreaks and map RVF high risk areas. Above normal rainfall and floods will usually trigger RVF outbreaks. In this study, we conducted surveillance for RVF in mosquitoes, domestic and wild ruminants. We then examined climatic conditions that may have been responsible for past RVF outbreaks and the unusually (>30 years) long inter-epizootic period. Finally, we derived RVF risk maps for Zambia using a combination of climatic variables. We found evidence of RVF infection in both wild and domestic ruminants while there was a positive correlation between past RVF outbreaks and above-normal rainfall. On risk mapping, we found favorable conditions (i.e. high rainfall and risk of flooding) for RVF emergence in northern and eastern parts of the country. Studies like this are important in planning surveillance and disease control programs.
