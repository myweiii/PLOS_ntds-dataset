Leptospirosis is among the most important zoonotic diseases in (sub-)tropical countries. The correct diagnosis of leptospirosis is very important to take a medical or public health decision. Therefore, we tested a serological test (ELISA) for its ability to correctly diagnose a negative sample as truly negative and a positive sample as truly positive. We tested the ELISA with European acute leptospirosis confirmed positive and negative samples and compared results with another serological test (microscopic agglutination test), which is the recognized reference test. Further, the ELISA was assessed for its ability to detect previous exposure to leptospires in serum samples from the indigenous Wiwa population from Colombia, where leptospirosis is expected to be endemic.
The ELISA performed very well with sera from patients with acute leptospirosis, however had difficulties to diagnose negative samples as truly negative in the Colombian field samples; hence unexposed persons were falsely diagnosed to be positive. Therefore, we recommend using the ELISA to detect acute leptospirosis several days after onset of illness in a non-endemic environment, but are not convinced of its usefulness to screen a population for previous Leptospira spp. exposure.
