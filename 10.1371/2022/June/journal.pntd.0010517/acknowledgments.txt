We would like to thank Colgate University for providing resources to perform this study. We would also like to thank Van Tran ’20 and Taz Saad ’22 for the software they provided to us. Finally, we would like to thank Samantha Nino and Ryan Gamer for their preliminary work on modeling STH infections.
