In developing countries such as Ethiopia, intestinal parasites are a significant public health problem. These parasites are detrimental to the health of schoolchildren. Numerous risk factors for parasitic infections have been identified using uni- and multi-variate logistic regression. However, logistic regression has inherent limitations when applied to data sets with a large number of risk factors. We used machine learning techniques in conjunction with logistic regression models to identify relevant risk factors for parasitic infections in a dataset of 954 Ethiopian schoolchildren with 54 different risk factors for parasitic infections. Additionally, we developed predictive models of parasitic infection. Compared to logistic regression, we discovered that machine learning techniques identified novel risk factors and had higher predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we discovered that infection prediction could be aided by combining socioeconomic, health, and hematological characteristics. As a result, we concluded that advanced machine learning methods should be used in conjunction with logistic regression to study parasitic infections.
