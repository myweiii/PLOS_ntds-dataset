Scabies is a skin disease caused by the ectoparasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. Most people with scabies have a diffuse and pruritic rash, while the most complicated forms of the infection can lead to bacterial infections and sepsis. Scabies is a global health concern and in 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) added it to the portfolio of conditions prioritized by WHOâ€™s Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. However, the prevalence of scabies among refugees residing in camps in Greece has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we wanted to obtain an overview of scabies epidemiology and identify trends over time. To do so, we analyzed data extracted from epidemiological reports submitted each week as part of the Greek National Public Health Organization. Our findings confirmed the high prevalence of scabies among refugees residing in the camps and identified a clear trend of significant increase over time. Public health interventions, like mass drug administration with ivermectin, could help restrain the dissemination of the disease and lower its burden among refugees.
