The current World Health Organization (WHO)—approved strategy for combating schistosomiasis, is the administration of praziquantel (PZQ) to subjects living in endemic communities. Due to concerns of the potential development of resistance to PZQ, there have been extensive studies to find putative candidate antigens capable of eliciting protective immunity particularly against the schistosomulum. One of such family of antigens discovered is the Schistosoma mansoni tegumental allergen-like proteins 1 through 13 (SmTAL1–13), of which the first six have been extensively studied. Although not present in the 3-hour schistosomulum, the SmTAL1 antigen has been found to induce cross-reactive IgEs that also recognize the SmTAL3 and SmTAL5 antigens present on the surface of cercariae and schistosomulae. Various epidemiological studies have indicated IgEs induced by SmTAL1 as potentially good markers/indicators for developing resistance to infection/re-infection. In this community-based intervention study, we sought to determine whether outcomes realized for Schistosoma haematobium TAL1 IgE. 7 weeks-post PZQ treatment would be predictive of protection against re-infection with S. haematobium. Our work not only assesses immune responses associated with ShTAL1, but also explores immune profiles that may characterize participants susceptible or resistant to re-infection with S. haematobium.
