Previous studies have identified a cause-effect relationship between fetal exposure to the Zika virus (ZIKV) and the development of central nervous system (CNS) anomalies and variable degrees of neurodevelopmental delay. This study aimed to compare the neurodevelopmental outcome of infants without CNS anomalies from two groups. One born to symptomatic ZIKV exposed women and another to asymptomatic ZIKV unexposed women. The ZIKV-exposed women were older, had a higher percentage of women in middle-class socioeconomic strata, had a higher level of education, were more likely to be single, and had higher rates of pregnancy comorbidity and premature births compared to ZIKV unexposed women. Infant survivors from these two groups of pregnant women had a neurodevelopmental evaluation at 12, 18, and 24 months corrected age (CA). Infants born to symptomatic ZIKV exposed women had higher motor and cognitive scores at 12 and 24 months CA, respectively, than infants born to ZIKV unexposed women. We conclude that infants without CNS anomalies born to ZIKV exposed women had normal neurodevelopment up to 24 months of CA than infants born to ZIKV unexposed women, supporting an all-or-nothing effect with maternal ZIKV exposure. School performance evaluation is required.
