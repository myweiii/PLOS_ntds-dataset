Typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, is a systemic infection common to many low- to middle-income settings. While the population structure of S. Typhi has been genetically characterised using whole genome sequencing in many endemic countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, we are still lacking a detailed understanding for many regions including those among the Asia-Pacific islands. Genomic surveillance of isolates spanning 30 years demonstrated a population structure of S. Typhi in Papua New Guinea (PNG) dominated by a single genotype (2.1.7) that emerged in the mid-twentieth century, is genetically homogeneous, and sensitive to a wide range of antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of typhoid. There was little evidence of inter-country transmission and the setting appeared free of S. Typhi genotypes commonly associated with AMR e.g. H58 (genotype 4.3.1). These data suggest that former first line drugs (chloramphenicol, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole), fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins and macrolides all remain viable options for controlling typhoid in addition to the introduction of Vi-conjugate vaccines and improvements to water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) related infrastructure. Routine molecular surveillance is necessary to monitor for introduced or emerging AMR to inform treatment guidelines and intervention strategies.
