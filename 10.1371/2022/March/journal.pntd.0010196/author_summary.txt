Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector borne disease endemic in Southeast Asia (SEA) and present in other regions of the world. In SEA the disease has been targeted for elimination. VL is transmitted by different species of sandflies and key strategies against VL rely on the control of the vectors. This systematic review assesses the efficacy and community effectiveness of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) in controlling sandflies and VL occurrence among humans. After a revision of 6331 initial hits, 25 studies were included in this systematic review. Main findings indicated that insecticide impregnated bednets and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) can effectively control sandflies, however, it was not possible to fully assess the role of ITNs in controlling VL transmission. Additional results showed that insecticide impregnated bednets are low cost and well accepted in the community, however early erosion of insecticides from the nets could occur. If insecticide impregnated bednets are combined with other vector control measures, such as indoor residual spraying, and together with case detection, it could be an important strategy to control VL in resource limited settings.
