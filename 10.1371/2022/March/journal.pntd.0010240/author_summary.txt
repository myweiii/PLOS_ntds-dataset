Paragonimiasis, caused by the lung fluke Paragonimus spp., is a global foodborne zoonosis of great public health concern. Paragonimiasis is primarily a pleuropulmonary disease. However, the worms sometimes migrate aberrantly to other parts of the body, thereby causing the granulomatous lesion(s). The most serious condition elicited by ectopic migration is cerebral paragonimiasis. This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical and imaging features of the largest number of 105 cases diagnosed between 1982 and 2003 in our laboratory. We also evaluated diagnostic feasibility of recombinant P. westermani yolk ferritin by ELISA. The patients were largely diagnosed in their 30s with the chief complaints of seizures, headaches, hemiparesis, and focal neurologic deficits. Seizures and visual defect were significant in the chronic stage patients having calcified lesion(s). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of recombinant P. westermani yolk ferritin by ELISA against patientsâ€™ sera or CSFs were 100% or 97%, and 97.2% or 92.5%, respectively. The diverse neurological manifestations of patients might be related to the nature and/or location of the lesions. P. westermani yolk ferritin is a promising antigen for serodiagnosis of both early-stage patients with non-calcified lesion(s) and chronic calcified cerebral paragonimiasis cases.
