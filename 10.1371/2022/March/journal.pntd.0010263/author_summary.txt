The relationship between Zika virus exposure during pregnancy and microcephaly (abnormally small head size) in infants is well known. Prenatal Zika virus exposure can also cause more subtle impacts in infant language, cognition, and motor function, and visual acuity, even in the absence of microcephaly. Interventions in the first 1,000 days of life can significantly improve these outcomes in at-risk children. Few studies have been carried out with the aim of improving neurodevelopment in Zika-exposed children. The present study utilized a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of a 12-week Intervention on neurodevelopmental outcomes in 24-30-month-old Zika-exposed children. Analysis showed significantly higher language and positive behaviour scores among children in the Intervention group compared to children in the Control group. The Intervention used in this study is relatively low-cost and easy to implement. The application of interventions from the global early child development field has implications for governments, policy makers, public health officials, and parents of Zika-exposed children who are seeking effective interventions to mitigate the risk of neurodevelopment delays in those children. The fact that these much-needed interventions already exist and can be rolled out relatively quickly and effectively is encouraging.
