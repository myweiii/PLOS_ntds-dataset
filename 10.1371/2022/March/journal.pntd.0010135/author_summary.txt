Dengue is a serious mosquito-borne disease and a threat to an estimated one third of the human population throughout the tropics. Prevention and control of dengue outbreaks is limited to vector control, and most public health programs use a variety of methods to kill the primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Water holding containers harboring the mosquitoâ€™s immature stages can be treated or eliminated, in addition to control measures that target infected adult mosquitoes. Sustainable interventions that effectively target adult mosquitoes are needed to increase the options for control of dengue and other Aedes-borne viral diseases. The use of insecticide-treated curtains (ITCs) has previously been shown to significantly reduce Ae. aegypti numbers in and around homes, but the impact of insecticide-treated jar covers (ITJCs) is less known. The results of this study demonstrated that both ITCs and ITJCs can reduce entomological indices, with the greatest impact detected when they were deployed together.
