Mycetoma, a chronic subcutaneous and cutaneous disease, designated as a "neglected tropical disease," is prevalent in dry and hot climates. Fungal mycetoma is caused by more than 50 species of soil-dwelling pathogenic fungi, and its diagnosis and treatment can be challenging. The prevention of infection and early diagnosis and treatment are essential, and for this purpose, environmental assessment to understand the fungal habitat is necessary. In this study, we performed DNA metabarcoding analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) for mycetoma pathogens from environmental soil samples in Sudan. The results suggest that multiple causative agents of fungal mycetoma are widespread regardless of the environment and can be a source of infection anywhere in an endemic area. Based on the results of this study, we expect that the investigation of fungi in soil using NGS technology may help identify infection routes and create risk maps for the prevention of mycetoma.
