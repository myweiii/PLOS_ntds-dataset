We would like to thank all the cattle keepers in the North West Region and the Vina Division of the Adamawa Region, whom collaborated in good will with their time and herd access to make data collection possible; also, we would like to acknowledge the support from the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Industrial Agriculture -MINEPIA- during the planning and execution stages of the project. Many thanks to Saidou Hamman who facilitated many of the contacts with the herdsmen, conducted the questionnaire in Fulfulde, English or French and supported the sampling process. To Rebecca Callaby for her coding advice.
