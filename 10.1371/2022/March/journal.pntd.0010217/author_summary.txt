Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever poses an important threat for public health, particularly in endemic locations in Eurasia and parts of Africa. Despite its long-standing recognition, CCHF is considered a neglected disease, with sporadic official case reports and evidence of serological circulation in remote rural areas and less frequently, in peri-urban settings in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the drivers associated with its emergence and the spatial-temporal patterns linked to its circulation and spread are not well-understood. In this study, we identified a high proportion of cattle with CCHFV antibodies suggestive of high levels of viral circulation in the North West and the Adamawa Regions in Cameroon. In pastoral cattle, there was a positive relationship between going on transhumance, older age, higher shrub density and lower absolute humidity and CCHFV individual seropositivity. In contrast, non-indigenous breeds reported a lower risk of being seropositive. These results can be interpreted in connection to the underlying dynamics of CCHFV cycle and underline potential mechanisms linked to disease expansion. From a public health perspective, high levels of exposure to CCHFV in cattle highlight the possibility of unrecognized human infection and therefore, emphasize on the need to remain vigilant to possible disease risks for local groups involved in pastoralism and to dairy smallholders across the region.
