Trachoma is the worldâ€™s leading infectious cause of blindness. Periodic mass azithromycin distributions have not resulted in elimination. Re-infection is thought to be an important barrier to elimination, but studies of serovar- or genovar-specific immunity and re-infection with ocular Chlamydia trachomatis have been limited. The present study investigated chlamydial genotypes in children who were infected with ocular chlamydia before azithromycin treatment and were confirmed to have cleared the infection 2 months later, but then were again infected at 6 months. The majority of re-infections were caused by the same ompA strain that was carried pre-treatment, which suggests poor protective immunity to chlamydia. The ompA types clustered by household, suggesting members of the same household as a source of re-infection. These findings could inform future mass treatment strategies and vaccine development.
