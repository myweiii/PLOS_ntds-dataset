Schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) are endemic in Yemen. However, the precise prevalence and distribution of these diseases had remained unclear as cases were mainly identified sporadically in health facilities when patients with chronic complications sought treatment. This study provided the first comprehensive mapping of SCH and STH infections and anaemia through implementing a countrywide cross-sectional school-based survey. Country-wide, both diseases were found to present a significant public health burden. SCH and STH prevalence were more than 60.0%, and more districts were affected by intestinal than urogenital SCH. Based on the WHO classification, the SCH levels of infection ranged from mild to moderate. One quarter of Yemeni districts had severe or moderate levels of A. lumbricoides infection. Trichuriasis is the second most common STH after Ascariasis, with a mild to moderate level of infection in most districts, except three districts where it was severe. Anaemia is a severe or moderate public health problem in 26.5% and 36.1% of districts respectively. To the best of our knowledge this study presents the first national picture of anaemia burden in school-aged children in Yemen. The studyâ€™s findings and recommendations will be used to inform the design of the ongoing national control and elimination programmes of these neglected tropical diseases in Yemen.
