Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus s.l. complex; its cycle involves canids and livestock, mainly sheep. It is endemic in areas with extensive livestock breeding activities, where close contact occurs between humans and the domestic dog-livestock parasite cycle. After ingestion of parasite eggs, people may develop fluid-filled cysts, mainly in the liver. CE is a neglected disease, which causes significant socioeconomic impact mainly on poor communities worldwide. Prevalence data in many affected areas is lacking or largely underestimated, partly because human cases typically do not reach medical attention or official disease records. We determined the prevalence of abdominal CE by ultrasound population-based screening in volunteers residing in urban and rural localities of the Monte Patria Municipality, Limarí province, Coquimbo region, which is an E. granulosus s.l. endemic area of northern Chile, and assessed the risk factors associated with human infection. We performed an ultrasound survey on 2,439 people residing in thirteen localities and found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (95% CI 1.1–2.2). A higher risk of infection was associated with residing in rural localities, older age and drinking non-potable water. CE cysts were either in active or inactive stages in equal proportions and 84.6% of infected volunteers were newly diagnosed with CE. Our findings will serve to support the implementation of cost-effective diagnostic, treatment and control strategies and to improve the epidemiological surveillance system for CE in Chile.
