In Mozambique, rabies is maintained primarily by the domestic dog, the principal vector and host species responsible for the majority of human cases dating back to the early 1900s. Control of animal rabies has historically been undertaken by government veterinary authorities, with limited involvement of the health and environment sectors. In the Massingir District in general, and in Limpopo National Park (LNP) in particular, parenteral dog rabies mass-vaccination campaigns and the provision of post-exposure prophylaxis are inconsistent. Limited resources for dog vaccination campaigns, insufficient veterinary field staff, inefficient disease notification procedures and inadequate training of health practitioners constraint effective rabies control across the country. Awareness of good practices regarding management of bite wounds among local community members and health practitioners is crucial to reducing rabies deaths. The results obtained in this study will inform government policy on practical interventions in the control of dog and human rabies.
