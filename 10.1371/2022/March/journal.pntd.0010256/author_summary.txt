Evidence of human exposures to rickettsial pathogens were reported from a cross-sectional study at a whole sub-district scale of local communities in Nan Province, Thailand. Seroprevalence and level of rickettsial exposures demonstrated differences between the habitat types, ecological aspects and socio-demographic factors. In addition, abundance of domestic animals in the community appeared to be one of significant factors influencing levels of human exposure to rickettsial pathogens. Our findings will benefit the local public health by raising awareness of rickettsial infections as one of potential health concerns in the community. Inclusion of rickettsioses in routine laboratory diagnosis would help to differentiate unknown febrile illness and guide appropriate treatment. Further studies are required, particularly in the fields of disease ecology as well as medical and veterinary entomology, in order to better understand epidemiology and potential zoonotic transmission of these neglected rickettsioses in endemic areas.
