    "Background": "The focus on laboratory-based diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warrants alternative public health tools such as rapid antigen tests. While there are a number of commercially available antigen tests to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), all cross-react with the genetically similar SARS-CoV-1 or require an instrument for results interpretation.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We developed and validated rapid antigen tests that use pairs of murine-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), along with gold nanoparticles, to detect SARS-CoV-2 with or without cross-reaction to SARS-CoV-1 and other coronaviruses. In this development, we demonstrate a robust antibody screening methodology for the selection of mAb pairs that can recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Linear epitope mapping of the mAbs helped elucidate SARS-CoV-2 S and N interactions in lateral flow chromatography. A candidate rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 N was validated using nasal swab specimens that were confirmed positive or negative by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Test results were image-captured using a mobile phone and normalized signal pixel intensities were calculated; signal intensities were inversely correlated to RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Overall, our results suggest that the rapid antigen test is optimized to detect SARS-CoV-2 N during the acute phase of COVID-19. The rapid antigen tests developed in this study are alternative tools for wide scale public health surveillance of COVID-19."
