The delays in diagnostic testing and lack of proper surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed, in part, to the unprecedented death toll and impediment to wellbeing. As asymptomatic individuals have contributed to a large portion of disease spread, improved public health tools for widespread screening are necessary to maintain low transmission levels. We developed new rapid antigen tests that can be administered in less than 15 minutes without instrumentation, offering potential for frequent asymptomatic screening at-home and for point-of-care use in high-traffic areas such as schools, hospitals, and airports. The SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody screening methodology resulted in pairs with or without cross-reaction to SARS-CoV-1, offering new opportunities for public health tools such as wide scale surveillance. This paper provides important insights for nanoparticle-based immunochromatographic assays.
