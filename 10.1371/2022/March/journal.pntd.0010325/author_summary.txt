Although relatively known for over 50 years, G6PD deficiency still greatly impairs Plasmodium vivax malaria treatment due to primaquine-associated hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). Several screening platforms are now available, which can be performed without specialized equipment and personnel, before providing malaria treatment. The main question is: in an already established public health system, would they be cost-effective to avoid the deleterious effect of hemolysis? This study evaluated the real use of the Standard G6PD screening test in two small municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon. Results show that the real-life use of the test was highly cost-effective when compared to a scenario with no routine G6PD screening. Hence, the negative clinical and economic consequences associated with inadvertent prescription of PQ to patients with G6PDd were diminished.
