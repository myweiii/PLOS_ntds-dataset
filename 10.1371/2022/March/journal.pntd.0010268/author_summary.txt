Toxoplasmosis is a disease that results from infection with a parasite known as Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). The parasite is considered to be one of the world’s most common parasites. Infection frequently occurs by eating undercooked contaminated meat, exposure to infected cat faeces, or mother-to-fetus transmission throughout pregnancy. The parasite has the ability to reach all body organs including the brain. This in turn, may lead to death specially among people with weakened immune systems and infants born to infected mothers. There are many treatment options for the disease, however they may have severe side effects or can’t fully reach the brain. Consequently, the present work focused on the formulation of a safe novel formula at the nano size for better tissue penetration. The novel treatment was achieved by preparing the natural organic chitosan/alginate nanoparticles and loading them with spiramycin (the safest drug used in toxoplasmosis) along with propolis (a natural bee product). The treatment efficacy of the novel spiramycin/propolis loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles was compared with the commercial spiramycin. The used drug showed a marked potency in toxoplasmosis treatment. The anti-parasitic effect and the safe nature of each of the used components potentiate its use as a promising treatment.
