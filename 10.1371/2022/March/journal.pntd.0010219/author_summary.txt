Onchocerciasis (‘River Blindness’), is a worm infection common in sub-Saharan Africa. More than 20 million people are suffering from the disease which can lead to disfiguring skin disease, visual impairment and permanent blindness. The currently recommended treatment is ivermectin, which kills the juvenile worms and reduces the severity of the symptoms, but fails to kill the adult worm. As a consequence, the treatment needs to be repeated for 10–15 years (life span of the adult worm), imposing a large burden on patients and communities. Hence, there is an urgent need for a new, safe and short-course drug that kills the adult worm and offers a rapid cure. Emodepside is a promising drug candidate which has recently been administered to healthy volunteers for the first time. In this study, we characterized the relationship between dose, systemic exposure in human and the probability of experiencing an adverse event. Modeling and simulation were used to propose a short-course dosing regimen which balances risks and benefits in order to achieve efficacy while maintaining safety. Our results support the further clinical development of emodepside thus contributing to onchocerciasis elimination efforts.
