    "Abstract": "CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), an ancient defense mechanism used by prokaryotes to cleave nucleic acids from invading viruses and plasmids, is currently being harnessed by researchers worldwide to develop new point-of-need diagnostics. In CRISPR diagnostics, a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) containing a \u201cspacer\u201d sequence that specifically complements with the target nucleic acid sequence guides the activation of a CRISPR effector protein (Cas13a, Cas12a or Cas12b), leading to collateral cleavage of RNA or DNA reporters and enormous signal amplification. CRISPR function can be disrupted by some types of sequence mismatches between the spacer and target, according to previous studies. This poses a potential challenge in the detection of variable targets such as RNA viruses with a high degree of sequence diversity, since mismatches can result from target variations. To cover viral diversity, we propose in this study that during crRNA synthesis mixed nucleotide types (degenerate sequences) can be introduced into the spacer sequence positions corresponding to viral sequence variations. We test this crRNA design strategy in the context of the Cas13a-based SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) technology for detection of Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a biosafety level 4 pathogen with wide geographic distribution and broad sequence variability. The degenerate-sequence CRISPR diagnostic proves functional, sensitive, specific and rapid. It detects within 30\u201340 minutes 1 copy/\u03bcl of viral RNA from CCHFV strains representing all clades, and from more recently identified strains with new mutations in the CRISPR target region. Also importantly, it shows no cross-reactivity with a variety of CCHFV-related viruses. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the degenerate sequence-based CRISPR diagnostic is a promising tool of choice for effective detection of highly variable viral pathogens."
