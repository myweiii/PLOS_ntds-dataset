Several types of CRISPR-based molecular diagnostics, currently under extensive development, hold great promise for field-deployable diagnosis of infectious diseases. These methods share a core mechanism of target recognition, where a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) contains a pathogen-specific “spacer” sequence that binds to the counterpart on the genetic material of the targeted pathogen. The recognition mechanism can sometimes be interfered with by sequence mismatches between the spacer and target, which could arise from variations in the target sequence. One of the variable targets of concern is Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which demonstrates broad sequence diversity and evolves into several genetic clades. To address the viral sequence diversity, we have developed a “degenerate” sequence-based CRISPR strategy. It introduces mixed nucleotide types at sequence positions of a crRNA spacer corresponding to variations in the target pathogen. The resulting assay detects all CCHFV clades effectively. These findings indicate that degenerate-sequence CRISPR is a feasible way to address highly variable diagnostic targets.
