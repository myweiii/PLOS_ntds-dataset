We thank Dr. Monica Terrao for some initial analysis of the RBP10 3’-UTR. Six fragments of the RBP10 3’-UTR were cloned by Juyeop Kim, a master student, during his 6-week lab rotation. We thank Claudia Helbig and Ute Leibfried for technical assistance, for preparing media and buffers. We are indebted to Prof. Dr. Nina Papavasiliou (DKFZ, University of Heidelberg) and Prof. Dr. Luise Krauth-Siegel (BZH, University of Heidelberg) for allowing us to share their laboratories including equipment and reagents after the flood in ZMBH.
