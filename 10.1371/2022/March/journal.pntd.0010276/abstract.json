    "Background": "Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a neglected and disabling gynecological disease that can result from infection with the parasitic trematode Schistosoma haematobium. Accurate diagnosis of FGS is crucial for effective case management, surveillance and control. However, current methods for diagnosis and morbidity assessment can be inaccessible to those at need, labour intensive, costly and unreliable. Molecular techniques such as PCR can be used to reliably diagnose FGS via the detection of Schistosoma DNA using cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples as well as lesser-invasive vaginal self-swab (VSS) and cervical self-swab samples. PCR is, however, currently unsuited for use in most endemic settings. As such, in this study, we assessed the use of a rapid and portable S. haematobium recombinase polymerase amplification (Sh-RPA) isothermal molecular diagnostic assay, coupled with simplified sample preparation methodologies, to detect S. haematobium DNA using CVL and VSS samples provided by patients in Zambia.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "VSS and CVL samples were screened for FGS using a previously developed Sh-RPA assay. DNA was isolated from VSS and CVL samples using the QIAamp Mini kit (n = 603 and 527, respectively). DNA was also isolated from CVL samples using two rapid and portable DNA extraction methods: 1) the SpeedXtract Nucleic Acid Kit (n = 223) and 2) the Extracta DNA Tissue Prep Kit (n = 136). Diagnostic performance of the Sh-RPA using VSS DNA extacts (QIAamp Mini kit) as well as CVL DNA extracts (QIAamp Mini kit, SpeedXtract Nucleic Acid Kit and Extracta DNA Tissue Prep Kit) was then compared to a real-time PCR reference test.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "These results supplement previous findings, highlighting that the use of genital self-swab sampling for diagnosing FGS should be explored further whilst also demonstrating that rapid and portable DNA isolation methods can be used to detect S. haematobium DNA within clinical samples using RPA. Although further development and assessment is needed, it was concluded that the Sh-RPA, coupled with simplified sample preparation, shows excellent promise as a rapid and sensitive diagnostic tool capable of diagnosing FGS at the point-of-care in resource-poor schistosomiasis-endemic settings."
