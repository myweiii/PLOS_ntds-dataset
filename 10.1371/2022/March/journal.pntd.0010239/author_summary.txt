Leprosy is an infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae characterized by skin and nerve lesions. Leprosy reactions can be observed, depending on variations in host-specific cellular immunity. Leprosy is described after antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in immunocompromised PLHIV from countries where leprosy and HIV infections are endemic. This is known as immune restoration inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), a brutal inflammatory response directed against a latent or quiescent pathogen. In this study we searched for cases of leprosy as IRIS in French Guiana and those published in the literature in order to describe their clinical characteristics. Overall, our results show that these cases are mostly observed as borderline tuberculoid leprosy, associated with or quickly followed by a type 1 leprosy reaction, sometimes with neuritis and/or ulceration of lesions. The outcome is favorable under standard leprosy treatment with HAART maintenance.
