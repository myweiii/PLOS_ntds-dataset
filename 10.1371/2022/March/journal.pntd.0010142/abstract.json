    "Background": "Little is known about the persistence and impact of non-rheumatic symptoms after acute chikungunya disease. We have studied the clinical presentation and long-term impact of rheumatic and non-rheumatic symptoms on health related quality of life (QoL) 2.5 years after disease onset. Additionally, the validity of the Cura\u00e7ao Long-Term Chikungunya Sequelae (CLTCS) score in classifying disease severity over time was evaluated.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This prospective cohort study followed 248 chikungunya patients. Symptoms and SF-36 QoL were evaluated during baseline and follow-up at 2.5 years using questionnaires. Chikungunya disease status was classified using the CLTCS-score. At 2.5 years after disease onset patients were classified as being recovered (43%), mildly (35%) or highly (22%) affected. In comparison to mildly affected, highly affected patients reported the highest prevalence of ongoing rheumatic and non-rheumatic/psychological symptoms, with increased prevalence of arthralgia in the lower extremities (p = .01) and fatigue (p = .049) over time, and higher pain intensity (p < .001). Compared to mildly affected, being highly affected was associated with weakness in the lower extremities (OR: 1.90; CI: 1.29\u20132.80, p = .001) and worsened physical and mental QoL impairment.",
    "Conclusions": "Patients are both physically and psychologically affected by rheumatic and non-rheumatic symptoms of long-term chikungunya disease."
