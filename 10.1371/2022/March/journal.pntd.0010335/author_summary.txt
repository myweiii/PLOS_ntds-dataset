Community participation is an essential strategy to fight against neglected tropical diseases such as leprosy. The people involved should be a priority when implementing interventions, both the people affected and their communities and the health professionals involved in the programmes. This research provides information about barriers and recommendations related to the daily work of health professionals who work at organisations with people affected by leprosy in India and Brazil. Those barriers are related to social stigma, gender inequalities, services, resources and community participation. Health workers propose recommendations to reduce these barriers and to guarantee the sustainability of the programmes.
