Following implementation of successful interventions, one of the primary challenges for neglected tropical disease programmes is identifying areas with remaining disease transmission. As disease prevalence decreases, these infections become increasingly rare and hard to detect. Serological assays measure long-lived disease-specific antibody responses indicating past exposure to pathogens and increase the probability of detecting disease transmission. Here, we integrate serological assays with environmental and spatial data to map priority areas for surveillance for multiple neglected tropical diseases in Northern Ghana using the two-stage cluster-based survey platform established for trachoma surveillance. The use of multiplex bead assays measuring exposure to multiple pathogens allows integrated surveillance of diseases of interest to the national control programme. We identify areas with high risks of transmission to selected diseases as well as areas with high uncertainty which are priorities for future control and surveillance efforts. Together, this highlights the utility of multiplex serological platforms as a tool for integrated surveillance and mapping of neglected tropical diseases.
