In India, the ‘Big four’ snakes, viz. Naja naja, Bungarus caeruleus, Daboia russelii, and Echis carinatus are considered medically significant. Hence therapeutic polyvalent anti-venoms are prepared against the concoction of the venoms from said snakes. In India, the dreadful effects of Hypnale hypnale bite was realized only during 2007 due to its misidentification as Echis carinatus and or Daboia russelii bite. Several case reports from India and Sri Lanka have underscored the ineptness of Indian therapeutic anti-venoms against H. hypnale envenoming. As H. hypnale venom is not marketed in India, Sri Lankan H. hypnale venom was compared with Indian E. carinatus, and D. russelii venoms for their biochemical, pathological, and immunological properties. The venoms differed greatly in the said properties. The rabbit monovalent anti-venoms of H. hypnale, E. carinatus, and D. russelii venoms neutralized the activities of their venoms, but they insignificantly cross-reacted with, and failed to show paraspecific neutralization of the effects of the other two venoms. Further, the therapeutic polyvalent anti-venoms from VINS, and Bharat failed to neutralize the H. hypnale venom-induced lethal toxicity in mice. Thus, this study is pressing the need for suitable anti-venom to treat the dreadful H. hypnale bite in India.
