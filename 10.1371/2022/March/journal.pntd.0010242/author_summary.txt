This prospective cohort study of adult patients aimed to estimate the presence and duration of detectable levels of chikungunya virus RNA in bodily fluids, including genital secretions, among participants in the acute and convalescent phases of the disease. In addition to the fluids usually used for diagnosis in humans (serum and plasma), we reported the detection of chikungunya virus RNA in all body fluids. Reports have shown that chikungunya virus RNA in serum declines to undetectable levels within 1â€“2 weeks after symptom onset. The viral persistence in the serum in our study was longer than expected. In addition, we showed that saliva and urine contained detectable viral RNA in both the acute and convalescent phases of the disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cohort study assessing the presence and persistence of CHIKV in genital fluids (vaginal secretions and semen). Knowledge of viral persistence can help inform recommendations for the control, treatment, and prevention of the disease. Additional studies on viral infectivity are warranted.
