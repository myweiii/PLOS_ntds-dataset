Neurocysticercosis, an NTD caused by the helminth Taenia solium, is a major cause of neurologic symptoms in endemic areas. Diagnosis rests upon imaging of the central nervous system, which is not always available, and is not specific in many cases. Testing for T. solium antigen in the peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid of patients with a high burden of neurocysticercosis has already been shown to have a high utility in assisting in diagnosis and following over the course of therapy, particularly for extra parenchymal disease. Here we describe a capture ELISA assay (called TsG10) with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting T. solium antigen that was produced recombinantly and can be easily transitioned into a lateral flow assay for point of care testing. We also demonstrate the utility in following this antigen assay over the course of treatment for patients with extra-parenchymal disease. Additionally, we publish the antibody sequence for use by any lab with the interest and capabilities of performing this test, without the need for access to a hybridoma.
