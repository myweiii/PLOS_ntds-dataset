Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging vector-borne disease caused by SFTS virus. After the first case was detected in China in 2009, SFTS endemic areas have gradually increased, with more than 23 provinces and cities reporting SFTS cases. In order to explore the transmission mechanism of SFTS and explain the impact of meteorological factors and tick density on the transmission routes of SFTS, this study collected SFTS cases data, meteorological data and tick surveillance data in Jiangsu Province from 2017 to 2019 to investigate the study question. The multi-population and multi-route dynamic model established in the previous study was used to calculate the infection rate coefficients of various transmission routes of SFTS in Jiangsu Province, and the generalized additive model was established to further elaborate the influence of SFTS transmission mechanism.
