Talaromyces marneffei can cause a fatal deeply disseminated fungal infection- talaromycosis. It is widely distributed in Southeast Asia and spreading globally, the disease is insidious and responsible for significant deaths. Clinicians need easy-to-use tools to make decisions on which patients are at a higher risk of dying after infecting T. marneffei. In this study, conducted in Southern China, we have evolved XGBoost machine learning model. 15 clinical indicators and laboratory measures were used to estimate a patient’s risk of dying in the hospital due to the T. marneffei infection. The study showed that the machine learning model has good predictive ability when tested in an internal testing population of patients. We expect that the model could help clinicians assess a patient’s risk of death in just the time of admission to help decide on early treatment timing of high-risk patients who are likely to die.
