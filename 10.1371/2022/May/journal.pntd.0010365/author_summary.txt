Combined NS1, IgM and IgG dengue rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have previously been shown to accurately diagnose those experiencing dengue virus (DENV) infections at the point of care and are now available as single commercial kits. Using such kits to additionally determine those experiencing primary (first) or post-primary (second, third or fourth) dengue infections however remains challenging as accurate immune status classification currently relies on laboratory analysis. We used logistic regression modelling methods to estimate RDT positive and negative outcomes according to corresponding PCR and ELISA laboratory-based methods, which showed high sensitivity and specificity. Dengue RDT outcomes were then predicted among a large sample of suspected dengue case reports, to calculate the probability of being primary or post-primary for dengue according to every possible set of dengue RDT outcomes, by day of fever. Different RDT outcomes, at certain stages of infection, were indicative of primary and post-primary immune status. Using our framework to determine dengue immune status at the point of care in low resource settings, regional surveillance systems could estimate and monitor dengue transmission intensity. Additionally, this framework could potentially support dengue prognosis and identify primary cases who would benefit from current vaccination regimes to prevent subsequent secondary infections associated with severe disease.
