    "Background": "Among other West African countries experiencing the high endemicity of deadly tuberculosis, the situation in Niger is poorly evidenced by microbiological investigations.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "The study of 42 isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Niger by whole genome sequencing using Illumina iSeq technology yielded four M. tuberculosis lineages: Indo-Oceanic L1 (n = 1) (2.3%), East-Asian (n = 1) (2.3%), East-African Indian L3 (n = 2) (4.7%) and Euro-American L4 (n = 38) (90.4%). The sub-lineage L4.1.3 comprising 18 isolates (47.3%) was predominant, followed by the L4.6.2.2 sub-lineage (Cameroon genotype, n = 13 isolates) (34.2%). Investigating drug resistance profile for 12 antibiotics found 8/42 (19%) pan-susceptible isolates and 34/42 (81%) resistant isolates; with 40/42 (95.2%) isolates being susceptible to clofazimine-bedaquiline.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "These unprecedented data from Niger highlight the dynamics of tuberculosis transmission and drug resistance in Niger and may assist tuberculosis control in this country which continues to support a high burden of tuberculosis."
