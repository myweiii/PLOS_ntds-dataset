Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a highly disabling and stigmatizing disease caused by parasitic worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. There is a coordinated global effort to eliminate LF based on mass drug administration (MDA) of donated anti-filarial medications. Improved methods are needed to determine when transmission of the infection has been interrupted in previously endemic areas so that MDA can be safely stopped. This paper reports the discovery and characterization of a novel W. bancrofti antigen, Wb-Bhp-1, which is a homologue of the Brugia malayi protein used in antibody tests to monitor filariasis elimination in areas of Asia where LF is caused by Brugia species. We show that a test for IgG4 antibodies to Wb-Bhp-1 was fairly specific for W. bancrofti infection. However, the sensitivity of this test varied by the geographic origin of the samples. Sensitivity was highest for samples collected in the Indo-Pacific region and lowest for samples collected in Côte d’Ivoire. Geographic differences in the parasite or the human immune responses to infection may account for this variability. This range in sensitivity highlights the importance of validating new diagnostic tests for parasitic diseases with samples from different geographical regions.
