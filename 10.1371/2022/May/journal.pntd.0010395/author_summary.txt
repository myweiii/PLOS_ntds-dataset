Helminth infections elicit type 2 immunity, which influences host immune responses to additional threats, such as allergens, metabolic disease and other pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common gram-negative pathogens causing pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. The mortality rate of ventilator associated pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa is higher than that due to other pathogens. Trichinella spiralis is a zoonotic nematode of intracellular parasitism that infects a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. There is a lung migratory phase in the life cycle of T. spiralis. In this study, we found that T. spiralis induced Th2 response in the mouse lung tissue. T. spiralis co-infected mice exhibited significantly more eosinophils and less neutrophils at 6 hours following P. aeruginosa infection, ameliorated pulmonary inflammation and improved survival in P. aeruginosa pneumonia. These findings suggest a pre-existing chronic helminth with a lung migration phase infection promotes the survival of bacterial airway co-infected host.
