Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is known for its high case fatality ratio (CFR) and long-term neurological sequelae. Although JE fatality and morbidity risk might change as the characteristics of the population change with the strengthened surveillance scales, expanded immunization coverage, and healthcare improvements, there have not been any updates in the estimates for JE mortality and morbidity estimates for 10 years. In this paper, we made updated estimates of the JE CFR and the proportion of JE survivors with long-term neurological sequelae by performing a systematic review and developing statistical and machine learning models. We estimated JE CFR decreased over time, with estimates of 26% (95% CI 22, 30) in 1961–1979, 20% (95% CI 17, 24) in 1980–1999, 14% (95% CI 11, 17) in 2000–2018, and 14% (95% CI 11, 17) in 2019–2030. countries without JE vaccination, younger JE cases, higher population growth rate, and lower rural population percentage were associated with higher JE CFR. We estimated that 36% (min-max 0–85) JE patients recovered fully at hospital discharge. One year after hospital discharge, 46% (min-max 0%-97%) JE survivors were estimated to live normally but 49% (min-max 3% - 86%) JE patients still had neurological sequelae. The insights gained will be important in evaluating and updating current JE disease burden among all endemic areas and effectively channeling resources to most needed areas.
