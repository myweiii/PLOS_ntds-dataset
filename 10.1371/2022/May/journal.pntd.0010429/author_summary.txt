Clonorchiasis, a food-borne trematodiases, affects millions of people in Asia. Highly cost-effective control strategies are critical for its control. Previous studies considering the economic evaluation of control strategies were rare, mostly based on interventions in practical, and not capable of evaluating long-term cost-effectiveness of strategies with possible combinations of control measures or under various coverages. Based on a dynamic, multi-group transmission model, we simulated different control strategies in a high clonorchiasis endemic area, and evaluated their cost-effectiveness. Among the three recommended strategies (i.e., WHO, Chinese and Guangdong strategies), the Guangdong strategy was the most cost-effective. For praziquantel, 470 sets of control strategies were identified as highly cost-effective strategies for achieving infection control (prevalence<5%) among the strategies of possible combinations of the three common measures (i.e., preventive chemotherapy, information, education, and communication (IEC) and environmental modification). The optimal strategy consisted of chemotherapy targeted on at-risk population, IEC and environmental improvement, with coverages all being 100%. The results for transmission control (prevalence<1%) and albendazole were obtained with the same procedures. The numerical results may help to develop control strategies for C. sinensis infection in high endemic areas. The methodology is applicable for other different endemic areas.
