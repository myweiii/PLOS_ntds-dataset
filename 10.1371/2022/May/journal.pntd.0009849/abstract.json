    "Abstract": "Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) refers to an incompletely defined syndrome of inflammation, reduced absorptive capacity, and reduced barrier function in the small intestine. It is widespread among children and adults in low- and middle-income countries and is also associated with poor sanitation and certain gut infections possibly resulting in an abnormal gut microbiota, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and stunting."
