Angola has experienced dengue, yellow fever and Zika virus outbreaks between 2013â€“2017. To improve the detection of arbovirus outbreaks in Angola, we set up the National Arbovirus Laboratory of Surveillance Programme at the National Institute of Health Research (INIS), Ministry of Health, Angola, which officially kick-started arbovirus surveillance activities in early 2017. In this study we tested samples collected from patients with suspected dengue cases between January 2017 to February 2019. We report molecular and genomic findings on DENV2 transmission in Angola. On-site whole genome sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis indicate a single introduction of the DENV2 Cosmopolitan genotype (also known as DENV2-II genotype) from Southern Asia, probably as a result of international travel, followed by moderate virus population growth. In Angola, most detections occurred in urban areas, although we detected DENV2 in 5 of the 18 provinces in Angola. This work emphasizes the importance of maintaining an active arbovirus surveillance programme throughout the country to investigate DENV transmission patterns and evaluate the risk of hyperendemicity in Angola.
