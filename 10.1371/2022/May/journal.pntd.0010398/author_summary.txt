Dengue is a rapid spreading mosquito-borne viral infection. Infections cause mild to severe diseases, including dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), a severe form that may kill infants and young children. One potential factor associated to dengue severity is the patientsâ€™ nutritional status. For dengue severity, World Health Organization (WHO) dengue case classification criteria in 1997 and revised version in 2009 were used. While body mass index for age and WHO growth chart were used to classify nutritional status. In this study, we would like to demonstrate the association of underweight/overweight and severity of dengue infection using both WHO classifications in 355 Thai children and adolescents. We compared the proportions of patients with dengue fever with different nutritional status to those with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), and also compared non-severe dengue to severe dengue. Nevertheless, we could not demonstrate an association of nutritional status and dengue severity. It was noted that higher proportions of patients with severe plasma leakage (DHF grade III and IV) were overweight compared to those with mild plasma leakage (DHF grade I and II) (45.5% vs. 18.8%).
