Despite brucellosis being a major concern worldwide, particularly for populations residing within resource-limited settings, a suitable estimate of annual incidence is currently nonexistent for human disease. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize global human brucellosis frequency by utilizing nationally reported case data supplied to the global intergovernmental public health authorities. The combined records demonstrate that within currently available and established international reporting systems, there are insufficient data to calculate the annual global frequency of human brucellosis. Furthermore, the regional differences in populations represented within reports, as well as actual reported case counts, bias the correct interpretation of the overall human brucellosis disease frequency. This suggests that broadcasting a specific global quantity of new cases each year is misleading and, accordingly, there is presently no way to assess the global public health impact of this disease. In past years, disease prioritization by individual countries, including the reallocation of funds to national surveillance, have been demonstrated to positively impact the completeness and representativeness of the data. In the future, the international community must similarly reallocate resources to understand and fill gaps within the available information. Application of this information can be directed towards effectively pinpointing disease burden and efficient control strategies. The reinstatement of human brucellosis as a priority Neglected Zoonotic Disease by the WHO would substantially facilitate this process.
