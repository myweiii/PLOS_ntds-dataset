Marburg virus (MARV) is one of the deadliest viruses known to man. One of the most effective vaccines against this pathogen uses a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) platform to express MARV glycoprotein (GP) immunogen. As rVSV-based vaccines may be used as medical interventions to mitigate or prevent outbreaks of MARV, defining the time window needed to elicit protection is vital. Here, a rVSV vector expressing MARV glycoprotein (rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP) fully protected nonhuman primates from lethality and disease when given as soon as 1 week prior to exposure. At 5- and 3-days pre-exposure, partial protection (80% and 20% survival, respectively) was achieved. Vaccination with rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP appears to “jump-start” the immune system to allow sufficient time for MARV-specific adaptive responses to form. This fast-acting vaccine is based on a similar platform as Ervebo, the only FDA- and EMA-approved vaccine for preventing Ebola virus infection. The rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP vaccine features additional attenuations in the rVSV backbone that may contribute to a more acceptable safety profile in vaccinees, as Ervebo in some recipients induced vaccine-related adverse events including rashes and joint pain.
