The California Mosquito-Borne Virus Surveillance and Response Plan was designed to monitor and evaluate West Nile virus activity in the state and guide vector control and public health responses to reduce the burden of West Nile virus disease. It uses a formula to estimate the risk of human infections based on available environmental surveillance data: the abundance and infection rates in Culex tarsalis and the Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes, the numbers of dead birds, seroconversions in sentinel chickens, and/or ambient air temperatures. We evaluated the effectiveness of this risk level system and compared it to the vector index, a simpler risk estimate based only on mosquito abundance and infection rates, used by many vector control agencies inside the U.S. We found that that the California risk levels were significantly associated with increased reported human disease incidence, particularly when all potential environmental components were included, and better fit the data than vector index.
