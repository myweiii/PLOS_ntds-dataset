The authors thank the California local mosquito and vector control agencies who collected and submitted environmental samples and provided financial support to testing laboratories, as well as the local public health jurisdictions who investigated and reported human WNV disease cases. We acknowledge the contributions of staff at the Davis Arbovirus Research and Training laboratory at UC Davis who conducted testing and maintain VectorSurv, particularly Ying Fang, Sandra Garcia, and Jody Simpson. The authors also appreciate Tina Feiszli, Leslie Foss, Kerry Padgett, and the other members of the CDPH Vector-Borne Disease Section, who conduct testing, staff the WNV call center, and provide extensive knowledge about WNV in California.
