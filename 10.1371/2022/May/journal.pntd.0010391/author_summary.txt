Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector borne disease endemic in Southeast Asia (SEA) and present in other regions of the world. VL is transmitted by different species of sandflies and key strategies against VL rely on the control of the vectors. This systematic review assesses the efficacy and community effectiveness of indoor residual spraying (IRS) in controlling sandflies and VL occurrence among humans. After a revision of 8822 initial hits, 21 studies were included in this systematic review.
Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts by up to 95% for at least one month. DDT has been used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over time. Combinations of different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as key issues for control programmes. No human transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS on human transmission,â€“although by modelling studies an effect of IRS on human transmission can be demonstrated.
