Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a well-known nematode parasitizing the host brain and is the leading cause of eosinophilic meningitis worldwide. Our study reports the migration route of Angiostrongylus cantonensis larvae in non-permissive host mouse and discovers that the larvae could induce fatal pneumonia in mouse lung during acute and early infection phase characterized by activation of Stat3/IL-6 signaling. Moreover, administration of inhibitors targeting Stat3/IL-6 signaling could significantly attenuate the AC-induced pneumonia of non-permissive host mouse, providing an effective candidate target for intervention of this severe parasitic pneumonia. These findings expand our understanding of Angiostrongyliasis cantonensis and indicate that more attention to AC-induced pneumonia is required when treatment for Angiostrongyliasis cantonensis in the future.
