Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease worldwide, but more prevalent in the tropics. Cases are more common following severe weather events, possibly due to flooding, which may more readily distribute soil and/or water contaminated with Leptospira spp., the disease agents. Human cases increased following the 2017 hurricanes that ravaged Puerto Rico (Maria and Irma), prompting environmental sampling of soil and water to assess the presence, abundance, and possible persistence of pathogenic leptospires in these environments. The goal was to better understand these potential reservoirs of human and animal disease. Diverse and novel groups of pathogenic Leptospira were abundant and widespread in soil and water in Puerto Rico and sometimes were consistently detected in these environments for >1 year. However, most groups we identified have not previously been described from humans and/or other animals, so the disease potential of these novel organisms is unknown. The results of this study reveal a tremendous amount of previously uncharacterized Leptospira diversity in soil and water in Puerto Rico. The description and characterization of these novel types improves our understanding of the genus Leptospira, and will aid in the development of improved diagnostics and preventative tools to advance public health outcomes.
