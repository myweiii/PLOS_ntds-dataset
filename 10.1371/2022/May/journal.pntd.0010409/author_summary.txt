As the severe form of leptospirosis could progress rapidly and be potentially fatal if not treated earlier, deciphering the pathophysiology kinetics of infection is crucial to determine the parameters of disease severity. To understand this, we challenged hamsters with the highly virulent Leptospira interrogans strain HP358. Pulmonary haemorrhage was observed as the earliest pathological change followed by liver and kidneys damages. The increased expression of IL-1β, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-α, high neutrophils and low lymphocytes and platelets production observed in the present study indicate that these parameters could serve as a cumulative panel of biomarkers in severe leptospirosis.
