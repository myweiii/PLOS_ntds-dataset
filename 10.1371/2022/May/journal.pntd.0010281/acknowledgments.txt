What next?
There is an important need to implement improved diagnostics for rickettsial illnesses for scrub typhus, murine typhus, and also SFG rickettsioses. Reference diagnostics remain difficult because they are based on the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test–it is time to promote the important transition from IFA to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and ELISAs [31].
Until more simple and accurate diagnostic tests are available and appropriately validated, the use of clinical and routine laboratory predictors in the decision process for empirical antibiotic treatment will be important–and also increasingly for training staff and improving medical awareness of the problem.
Here is the second paper of Hanh Thi Duc Tran’s publication series on scrub typhus in Vietnam. A recent paper presented risk factors to help preventing scrub typhus at the community health care level; next she will evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs and ELISAs for scrub typhus in Vietnam and follow up with an evaluation on the implementation of these elements in the endemic scrub typhus setting of Central Vietnam.
