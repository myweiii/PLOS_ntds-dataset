Although the number of leprosy patients is gradually decreasing after the use of rifampin, those who have been cured still have bone damage. The Mycobacterium leprae is difficult to culture in vivo, and the potential biosafe problem should be considered. Thus, the minimal essential structure in Mycobacterium, N-glycosylated muramyl dipeptide, has been used to reveal the mechanism in leprosy. According to the analysis results, various differentially expressed genes have been filtered, and circadian Clock gene might be the key factor. We verified that Clock gene was upregulated in the process of osteogenesis. Osteocytes would maintain the balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone homeostasis. We noticed that the expression of Clock gene was decreased after treated with N-glycosylated muramyl dipeptide. This might be the reason why bone damage is still maintained in the cured patient, and regulating the expression of target at posttranscriptional level by microRNAs and circular RNAs can be the promising therapeutic method in leprosy bone damage.
