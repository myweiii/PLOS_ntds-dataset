Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged to cause outbreaks in Southeast Asia and the Americas during 2015–2016. However, the scale of outbreaks in Southeast Asia were significantly smaller compared to epidemic in the Americas. A methionine to valine amino acid mutation at residue position 114 of the NS5 protein (NS5-M114V) is hypothesized to influence the epidemic outcomes of ZIKV, which led to the large-scale epidemic that occurred in the Americas. By analyzing infection of mammalian and mosquito cells, IFNα/β receptor knockout (Ifnar-/-) mice and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with engineered ZIKV isolates containing either methionine or valine at residue position 114 of the NS5 protein, we demonstrated that the NS5-M114V mutation did not affect virus replication efficiency and STAT2 degradation in cells, virulence in mice, or virus secretion into the mosquito saliva. The NS5-M114V mutation slightly prolonged viremia in Ifnar-/- mice and reduced mosquito infection rate. Collectively, our findings suggest that the NS5-M114V mutation is unlikely to have significantly influenced the ZIKV epidemic in the Americas.
