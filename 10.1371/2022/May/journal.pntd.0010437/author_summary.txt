African tick-bite fever (ATBF) is a widespread, endemic tick-borne rickettsiosis caused by the bacterium Rickettsia africae. ATBF is second only to malaria as the cause of acute febrile illness in travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa, and R. africae seropositivity rate (which is indicative of past infection) is high in indigenous populations from rural areas. The primary vector of R. africae in southern Africa is the South African bont tick, Amblyomma hebraeum. This tick is a highly aggressive human biter during the larval life stage. In this study, we quantified the density of infected A. hebraeum larvae across the lowveld savanna in Eswatini. We found over half of tested A. hebraeum larvae were infected with R. africae, and the density of infected larvae can be high in multiple land uses, including wildlife preserves, ranches, and community grazing lands. This high likelihood of a bite by an infected A. hebraeum in the savanna of Eswatini suggests ATBF poses a significant risk to travelers and may contribute to unexplained acute febrile diseases in the region.
