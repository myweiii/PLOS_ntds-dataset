Schistosomiasis is a zoonosis that affects more than 200 million people worldwide. A wide range of mammals, including mice, are permissive hosts of Schistosoma and develop chronic disease characterized by egg-granuloma formation and fibrosis after infection. Rats, on the other hand, are non-permissive hosts and develop efficient immune responses to eliminate the worms. Interestingly, schistosome eggs elicit a dominant Th2 immune response within mouse hosts, whereas rats with schistosomiasis develop a significant Th2 response in the absence of available egg production. The Th2 response in rats seems to play an essential role in the protection of the host against Schistosoma. So far, the factors that lead to the different immune responses to Schistosoma infection in both hosts have not been demonstrated. In this study, our results show that an iNOS-dependent mechanism maintains the function of the immune system in rats by modulating CD4+ T cell-mediated Th1/Th2-associated cytokine responses and chemokine production. Additionally, the absence of iNOS led to slow clearance of parasites, increases in the development of worms, and an exacerbation of granuloma formation and fibrosis in rats. Furthermore, high levels of NO in rats can promote the development of fibrosis induced by inflammation (rapid inflammatory repair). Therefore, this study demonstrates that the difference in iNOS levels between mice and rats is responsible for the different immune responses and outcomes induced by schistosome infection in both hosts.
