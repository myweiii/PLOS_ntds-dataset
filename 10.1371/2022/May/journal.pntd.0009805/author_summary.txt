Here, we developed and evaluated an ELISA diagnostic test based on the Protein A-peroxidase conjugate that allows the test to be used for plague laboratorial diagnosis not only in humans, but also in a wide range of mammalian species. This particularity is specifically important for plague epidemiological surveillance, given that Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, have a long list of animal reservoirs across distinct ecosystems. Briefly, we first evaluated the best reaction parameters, such as antigen concentration, serum and protein A-conjugate dilutions. Next, we used serum samples from humans, dogs, rodents and rabbits (n = 288) with known results for plague serology by a conventional method, to evaluate the performance of the new Protein A-ELISA test. We observed a good performance of the novel Protein A-ELISA test, with high sensitivity and specificity rates. Evaluation of the coefficient of variation revealed that the test measurements suffer little variation, and therefore, has high repeatability and reproducibility. Next, by evaluating 487 samples, we observed a high degree of concordance between the Protein A-ELISA with a conventional IgG-based ELISA. Furthermore, this test showed no significant cross-reaction with other common infectious diseases. Altogether, the Protein A-ELISA showed high performance when compared both to HA and Anti-IgG ELISA, with a single protocol that requires reduced amounts of antigen and can be employed to several plague hosts.
