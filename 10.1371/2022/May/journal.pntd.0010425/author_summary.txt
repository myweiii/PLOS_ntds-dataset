Rabies is caused by the Rabies lyssavirus, for which no approved antiviral drug is available, and that is one of the deadliest virus infections that kills almost all individuals who develop symptoms. According to the World Health Organization, millions of disability-adjusted life years are lost each year, and approximately 59,000 people die from rabies. Since rabies can be prevented by a very safe and very effective vaccine, aforementioned loss is particularly tragic.
For residents of areas where the Rabies lyssavirus is endemic as well as travelers visiting these regions, vaccination and the verification of protective immunity conferred by neutralizing antibodies are crucial for the global fight against rabies. To optimize this process, we have developed and validated a simple, reliable, and cost-effective assay for the quantification of antibodies that neutralize the Rabies lyssavirus. The assay is based on an in-cell-ELISA approach. We are convinced that our method is suitable to replace the currently used expensive and labor-intensive methods, so that additional neutralization tests can be performed. This could help our colleagues in developing regions such as the tropics, which are disproportionately affected, in the fight against rabies.
