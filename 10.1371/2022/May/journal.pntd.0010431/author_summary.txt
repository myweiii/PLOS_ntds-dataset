Lysine malonylation has been shown to play important roles in various biological processes in Toxoplasma gondii. Here, we used quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and immuno-affinity purification to test the hypothesis that lysine malonylation underpins the inter-genotype differences in the virulence of T. gondii. Several up-regulated and down- regulated malonylated proteins were identified in the tachyzoites of RH (type I) strain, PRU (type II) strain, and VEG (type III) strain. Differentially regulated malonylated proteins were enriched in many biological and metabolic pathways, and were found to contribute T. gondii energy metabolism, stress response, and infectivity, suggesting the role of lysine malonylation in the regulation of T. gondii virulence. These findings expand our knowledge of lysine malonylation in T. gondii and provide more insight into the mechanisms mediating the virulence differences between T. gondii strains of different genotypes.
