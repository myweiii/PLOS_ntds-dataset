Aedes aegypti L. species is the primary vector responsible for transmission of the dengue virus worldwide including chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika virus. The experiment presented in the manuscript represents a study undertaken to demonstrate suppression of the wild type Ae. aegypti population in large outdoor field cages with natural exposure to the environment (physically-contained field cage facility) by sustained releases of male adults of OX513A Ae. aegypti strain. This investigation is a phase-2 contained study as per the World Health Organization guidelines for evaluation of genetically modified organisms and was recommended by the Indian regulatory board. This experiment demonstrates suppression of wild type Ae. aegypti population by sustained releases of OX513A male adults in a contained facility. The prospect of the project is to demonstrate and implement the technology for controlling/suppression of the Ae. aegypti vector in the open field environment.
