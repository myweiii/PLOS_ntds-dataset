Canine rabies is responsible for tens of thousands of human deaths annually worldwide, primarily in Asia and Africa. In Thailand, a sharp increasing trend of animal rabies cases was recently observed during 2014 and 2018, in which the numbers of cases were 250 and 1,105, respectively. As a directly transmitted disease, geographical distributions of buildings where dogs can live in, and road networks could inevitably influence the spatiotemporal spread of rabies. To investigate the role of these geographical structures on the transmission dynamics of canine rabies, we developed a stochastic individual-based model that integrates the exact geographical distributions of buildings and roads. The spatial distribution of dogs was assumed according to the distribution of buildings, with roads included to help dogs travel around. The model was then applied to investigate rabies transmission in the low-risk and high-risk areas in Thailand. Our modeling results highlighted that only differences in the geographical structures of buildings and roads could result in the difference in rabies transmission dynamics in these two areas. We also explored the impacts of reducing dog population, restriction of owned dog movement, and dog vaccination on the rabies spread. We discovered that lowering the dog population alone might not be enough to keep rabies from spreading in the high-risk area. Owned dog confinement may lower the risk of rabies transmission even more. In addition, different levels of vaccination coverages are probably required to control rabies in different geographical settings.
