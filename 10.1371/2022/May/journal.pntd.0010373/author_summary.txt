Leishmania parasites infect over a million people each year—including over 200,000 infections with deadly visceral leishmaniasis—resulting in a greater health burden than any human parasite besides malaria. Leishmania infections of humans are transmitted by blood-feeding sand flies, which also consume floral nectar. Nectar contains many chemicals that inhibit Leishmania growth and are candidate treatments for infection of humans. However, these same compounds could also reduce infection in nectar-consuming sand flies. By combining existing data on the chemistry of nectar and sensitivity of Leishmania to plant compounds, we show that some floral nectars contain sufficient chemical concentrations to inhibit growth of insect-stage Leishmania. Our results suggest that consumption of these nectars could reduce parasite loads in sand flies and transmission of parasites to new human hosts. In contrast to insecticide-based methods of sand fly control, incorporation of antiparasitic nectar sources into landscapes and domestic settings could benefit public health without threatening beneficial insects. These findings suggest an unexplored, landscape-based approach to reduce transmission of a major neglected tropical disease worldwide.
