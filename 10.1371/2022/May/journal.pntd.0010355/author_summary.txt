Available information on mosquito resistance to insecticides is mainly restricted to residential and public areas, whereas commercial settings, such as hotels are overlooked. This may hide the real size of an insecticide resistance problem and lead to ineffective mosquito control. We investigated insecticide susceptibility of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes occurring at selected hotel compounds on Zanzibar Island. We also looked at whether resistance occurred in mosquitoes with gene mutations for two proteins (voltage-gated sodium channels and glutathione-S-transferase) that are known to cause resistance to insecticides in other parts of the world. The Ae. aegypti mosquitoes collected from hotels were highly resistant to DDT, and moderately and possibly resistant to deltamethrin and propoxur, respectively. However, resistance to these insecticides was not linked to mutations in either of the studied genes. The presence of insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti in hotel compounds on Zanzibar is concerning and shows that these areas can act as sources of resistant mosquitoes. More needs to be done to establish the underlying causes for insecticide resistance in hotel Ae. aegypti populations, and this information can then be used to design measures that prevent resistance from becoming more widespread on Zanzibar.
