We are immensely grateful to the support of the kebeles where this work was conducted, in particular, the participants who allowed our researchers into their homes for intensive observation with overnight stays. We also wish to thank staff at the Fred Hollows Foundation Ethiopia for assistance with the logistics for the field work, particularly our dedicated drivers (Teka Ashagrie, Kibreab Abino and Fitsum Shappa).
