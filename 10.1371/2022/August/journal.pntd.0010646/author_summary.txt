Efforts to achieve elimination are mainly focused on the curative or treatment aspects. However, it is important to be aware that disability due to leprosy still occurs even after treatment has been completed. The WHO definition for disability includes bodily function and structure impairment, activity limitation and participation restriction. In leprosy, disability can cause broad problems and have an impact on education, employment, and lead to social and economic problems. This study is aimed to obtain data on activity limitation in people affected by leprosy in a district with high prevalence and a leprosy community. A total of 267 patients participated in this study. Physical examination was performed on the eye, hand and foot disabilities based on WHO guidelines, and patients were asked to complete the SALSA (The Screening Activity Limitation Safety Awareness) questionnaire to measure activity limitations. Based on the total SALSA score, this study revealed that 71.5% of participants experienced activity limitations. Occupational status indicates the ability of people affected by leprosy to optimize their functional activities. Thus, integrated management of disability is essential to improve activity limitations.
