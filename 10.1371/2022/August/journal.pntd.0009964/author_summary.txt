Tuberculosis in cattle (bTB) causes financial losses to livestock owners and is a disease transmissible to humans especially those with an occupational risk through exposure to infected animals and animal products. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of bTB and characterize the mycobacterial species from cattle slaughtered in the six abattoirs in Rwanda. Four M. bovis, as well as one rifampicin-resistant (RR) M. tuberculosis, were identified from slaughtered cattle and, thus, the apparent bTB prevalence was 1.7% (5/300). Likely, the RR M. tuberculosis isolate was mostly likely of human origin and transmitted to cattle during close human-cattle contact. It is therefore essential to control bTB in cattle and reinforce the protection of farmworkers and abattoir workers who are always exposed to infected animals.
