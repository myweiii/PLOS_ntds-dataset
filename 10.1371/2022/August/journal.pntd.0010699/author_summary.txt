Rabies is a fatal, zoonotic disease of global importance. In Latin America, the common vampire bat is responsible for most of the rabies outbreaks in livestock, and for decades, culling vampire bats has been an approach to control rabies. However, culling is not a sustainable practice, and non-lethal control strategies, such as the use of oral rabies vaccines, offer an alternative to manage the disease at the reservoir level. Our vaccine candidate, RCN-MoG, uses raccoon pox (RCN) as a viral vector for a mosaic gene expressing rabies glycoprotein (MoG). We orally or topically vaccinated wild-caught vampire bats with RCN-MoG and found that only a small proportion produced neutralizing antibodies after vaccination, and their survival to challenge with rabies virus (a measurement for vaccine protection) was not significantly improved compared to unvaccinated bats. Notably, however, vaccination with RCN-MoG had a blocking effect against viral shedding in the saliva of infected bats that succumbed to rabies. Our findings revealed a previously unknown but important benefit of vaccinating vampire bats: preventing viral shedding by rabid bats, which could reduce the spread of disease among bats and other animals. These observations should encourage further research, especially under field conditions.
