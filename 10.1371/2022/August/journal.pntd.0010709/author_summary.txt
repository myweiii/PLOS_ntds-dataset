Infections with the roundworm, Ascaris lumbricoides and the whipworm Trichuris trichiura are estimated to affect over 800 and 400 million people, respectively. Infections are most common in children and whilst very heavy infections present clear pathology it is less clear what effect more moderate infection have on the growth and development of children. Attempts to quantify the detrimental effects in humans have been inconclusive to date due to multiple confounding variables. Therefore, animal models are required. Pigs are natural hosts to two very closely related helminths; A. suum and T. suis and therefore we have investigated the effects of infection on growing pigs. This study has identified an association of infection levels with both helminths with reduced weight gain but also that whipworm infection may be more detrimental to weight gain than giant roundworm infection. Given the overall high prevalence of A. lumbricoides and difficulties in successfully clearing whipworm infections (multiple doses of anthelminthic are required), this work highlights the importance of drug administration programs targeted to clear these infections in children.
