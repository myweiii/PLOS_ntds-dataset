    "Background": "Snakebite envenomation exerts a heavy toll in sub-Saharan Africa. The design and production of effective polyspecific antivenoms for this region demand a better understanding of the immunological characteristics of the different venoms from the most medically important snakes, to select the most appropriate venom combinations for generating antivenoms of wide neutralizing scope. Bitis spp. and Echis spp. represent the most important viperid snake genera in Africa.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Eight rabbit-derived monospecific antisera were raised against the venoms of four species of Bitis spp. and four species of Echis spp. The effects of immunization in the rabbits were assessed, as well as the development of antibody titers, as judged by immunochemical assays and neutralization of lethal, hemorrhagic, and in vitro coagulant effects. At the end of immunizations, local and pulmonary hemorrhage, together with slight increments in the plasma activity of creatine kinase (CK), were observed owing to the action of hemorrhagic and myotoxic venom components. Immunologic analyses revealed a considerable extent of cross-reactivity of monospecific antisera against heterologous venoms within each genus, although some antisera provided a more extensive cross-reactivity than others. The venoms that generated antisera with the broadest coverage were those of Bitis gabonica and B. rhinoceros within Bitis spp. and Echis leucogaster within Echis spp.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The methodology followed in this study provides a rational basis for the selection of the best combination of venoms for generating antivenoms of high cross-reactivity against viperid venoms in sub-Saharan Africa. Results suggest that the venoms of B. gabonica, B. rhinoceros, and E. leucogaster generate antisera with the broadest cross-reactivity within their genera. These experimental results in rabbits need to be translated to large animals used in antivenom production to assess whether these predictions are reproduced in horses or sheep."
