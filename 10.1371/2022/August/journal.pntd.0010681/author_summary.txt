Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease that affects the most vulnerable people in low and middle-income countries. It is caused by Leishmania parasites. VL can be fatal, however there are efficient treatments to control this disease. In contrast, patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL patients) who are co-infected with HIV (VL/HIV patients), they harbour a higher parasite load and suffer from treatment failure and frequent relapses. In this study, we analysed the effector functions of neutrophils, a type of blood cells that has the ability to take up Leishmania parasites and kill them. We show that over time in VL/HIV patients, the neutrophil counts remain significantly lower as compared to VL patients and healthy controls and they also display an impaired capacity to phagocytose. These results suggest that dysregulated neutrophils contribute to the impaired control of parasite replication in VL/HIV patients.
