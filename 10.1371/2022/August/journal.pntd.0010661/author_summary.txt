Among neglected tropical diseases, schistosomiasis is a serious disease caused by infection with the parasite Schistosoma japonicum. Treatment of schistosomiasis is currently almost exclusively with praziquantel, which kills mainly adult parasites, with minimal effectiveness against immature schistosomes and eggs. However, the parasiteâ€™s eggs are primarily responsible for schistosomiasis dissemination and pathology. In addition, overuse of praziquantel in epidemic areas has led to drug resistance and a reduced cure rate. Thus, new parasite targets for the development of novel therapeutics are crucial. Here, we evaluated the potential of JQ-1, a bromodomain and extra-terminal protein inhibitor, to suppress the production of S. japonicum eggs. Application of JQ-1 to S. japonicum in vitro decreased the number of mature germ cells, the rates of oviposition, and the number of eggs produced in each male-female pairing. JQ-1 treatment of mice infected with S. japonicum ameliorated hepatic granuloma and decreased serum liver enzymes, suggesting improved liver function. These results indicate that JQ-1 inhibits reproductive development and egg production in S. japonicum, providing supporting evidence that JQ-1 warrants additional study for use as a novel approach in the prevention or treatment of schistosomiasis.
