Leishmania tarentolae is a saurian-associated parasite recently reported in geographical areas where Leishmania infantum is endemic. To confirm the circulation of both protists in sand flies, reptiles and dogs and to isolate new Leishmania spp. strains, reptilian and sheltered dog blood samples were collected and sand flies captured. Samples were molecularly tested for Leishmania spp. and sandflies for origin of blood meal. Dog sera were tested by IFAT for both Leishmania species and reptilian blood and intestine of sand flies were cultured. Four Tarentola mauritanica geckoes were positive for L. infantum or L. tarentolae; moreover, amastigote-like forms of L. infantum were observed in the bone marrow. 24/294 sand flies scored PCR positive for Leishmania spp. Reptile and dog blood were found in S. minuta, dog and human in Ph. perniciosus and dog in Phlebotomus neglectus. Two axenic strains of L. tarentolae were obtained. Twelve of 19 dogs scored positive for L. infantum and L. tarentolae by IFAT and three of them also for L. infantum by PCR, and six by qPCR. Data confirm the sympatric circulation of L. infantum and L. tarentolae in geckoes, sand flies, and dogs, and suggest that geckoes may be infected with L. infantum.
