Rabies in dogs can be prevented by vaccination, and this approach has become a cornerstone in the control and eventual elimination of the disease. However, vaccinating hard-to-reach often free-roaming dogs are a challenge and represents one of the challenges to reach sufficient herd-immunity. A potential solution would be to vaccinate these dogs using oral baits filled with a vaccine. In this study we have assessed the acceptability of oral rabies vaccination (ORV) in Namibian dogs under field conditions. The results demonstrate that the method is acceptable both for the owners and the dogs, with a very high uptake of the egg-flavored bait. This supports the potential of ORV to contribute to vaccination programs where parenteral vaccination alone failed to reach sufficient vaccination coverage in the dog population.
