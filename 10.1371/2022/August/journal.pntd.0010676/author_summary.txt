After infection with Leishmania infantum cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis can develop, but in most cases the host becomes an asymptomatic carrier of the parasite. This key population of individuals with latent leishmaniasis can undergo reactivation of the infection with severe outcome in case of immunosuppression and can contribute to disease transmission.
The public health impact of leishmaniasis is currently underestimated in Europe, despite Leishmania infection is endemic in the Mediterranean countries and outbreaks of human leishmaniasis have been reported in the last decades, including northeastern Italy. One of the causes contributing to this neglect is that the available diagnostic tests exhibit scarce sensitivity in identification of latent leishmaniasis.
In this study, we identified latent Leishmania infection in a newly endemic area of northeastern Italy by using three different diagnostic methods; serological, molecular and immunological tests. Sixteen percent of individuals residing in the selected area were shown to be positive to at least one of the three tests, which indicates a previous contact with the parasite. This study highlights the importance of test combination to enhance the ability to identify latent Leishmania infection.
