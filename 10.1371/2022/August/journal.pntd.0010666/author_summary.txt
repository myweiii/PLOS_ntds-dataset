Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by Dabie bandavirus, also known as SFTSV, and reported in countries of Northeast Asia including China, Japan and South Korea. The average fatality rate is more than 10% and reported to increase with age. Currently, no vaccines or targeted treatments for SFTS are available and only symptomatic therapy is offered. Thus, SFTSV diagnosis at early stages is critical for successful therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we developed a molecular diagnostic technique for detection of SFTSV using the CRISPR-Cas12a system combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). Using this method, we successfully diagnosed SFTSV infections under isothermal conditions with the reaction time of 50 min from blood plasma.
