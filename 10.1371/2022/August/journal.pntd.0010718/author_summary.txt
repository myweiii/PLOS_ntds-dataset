People living with HIV (PLHIV) are more likely to develop visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and are more likely to have poor outcomes associated with VL-HIV coinfection than HIV-negative individuals. While an estimated 3â€“14% of immunocompetent individuals living in endemic areas show serological evidence of asymptomatic infection with VL, such data on Leishmania infection in PLHIV in India are lacking. As such we sought to establish the prevalence and determinants of asymptomatic Leishmania infection (ALI) in PLHIV in VL endemic districts of Bihar, India using a combination of molecular and serological assays. We further expand our definition of ALI to include the urinary Leishmania antigen ELISA. The prevalence of ALI in a population of PLHIV residing in VL endemic districts of Bihar, India was found to be as high as 9.0% (n = 116). The majority of individuals were detected by the rK39 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (7.4%, n = 96), and very few individuals were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (0.5%, n = 6) or the rK39 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (0.4%, n = 5). In total, 2.2% (n = 28) were positive by urinary Leishmania antigen ELISA. Low CD4 counts and larger household size were found to be risk factors for ALI. Here, we add to the evidence base for Leishmania-HIV coinfection on the Indian subcontinent.
