Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), an emerging hemorrhagic fever in Asia, is caused by SFTSV, a tick-borne bunyavirus. In this study, we analyzed the prevalence of SFTSV in rodents and their ectoparasite chigger mites (Leptotrombidium delicense) with RT-PCR. RT-PCR results showed that one third (32.3%, 10/31) rodents and one chigger (0.2%, 1/564) was positive to SFTSV. Our study suggested that rodents and chiggers may play an important role in the ecology of SFTSV.
