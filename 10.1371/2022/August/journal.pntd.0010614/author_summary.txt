Rabies is an endemic disease that kills approximately 59000 persons mostly in low- and middle-income countries. The disease is mostly transmitted through dog bites and children under 15 years account for 40% of all dog bite incidents and 35–50% of all rabies death. This study assessed the knowledge and perception of canine rabies among pupils under 15 years in Kwara State, Nigeria. Our findings showed a very low rabies awareness rate (21.7%) and equally low knowledge of rabies (29.2%) with a mean knowledge score of 1.7±0.8. The dog ownership rate was 18.7% with an average of 1.93 dogs per household. Approximately 5% of the pupils have been previously bitten by a dog. One-third of the dog bite victims were managed and treated at home and only 12% were treated in a health facility. The age of the pupil, their dog ownership status and their geopolitical location within Kwara State influenced the pupil’s knowledge of canine rabies. To control rabies, we must institute multi-sectoral collaborations of critical stakeholders and introduce rabies lessons into the school curriculum in Kwara State.
