Whole genome sequencing of 63 invasive Salmonella from 5 tertiary hospitals in Nigeria revealed multiple serovars including a dominant antibiotic-resistance-gene harbouring S. Typhi 3.1.1 genotype comprising a gyrA_S83Y and IncY plasmid. We also report invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella harbouring typhoidal toxins.
