Accurate diagnostic tests are needed to aid scabies control efforts. In particular they might aid decisions about when to start and stop treatment of whole communities (mass drug administration). Currently most diagnosis is based on clinical examination only and there is a need to establish what criteria new diagnostic tests should meet for them to be of public health use. To aid with this, we determined the programmatic areas of greatest need (use cases) and then developed a shortlist of product requirements (target product profiles, or TPPs) for each scenario. These TPPs can then be used by product developers to ensure that novel diagnostic tools in development are fit for purpose. There were two programmatic use cases for which scabies TPPs were developed. The first TPP focused on diagnostics to determine if the community prevalence of scabies was above 10%—the threshold at which mass drug administration is recommended. The second TPP focused on diagnostics to determine if the community prevalence of scabies is below 2%—the threshold at which mass drug administration can be stopped.
