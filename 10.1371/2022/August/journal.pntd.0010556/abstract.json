    "Background": "Scabies was added to the WHO NTD portfolio in 2017 and targets for the control of scabies were included in the 2021\u20132030 WHO NTD roadmap. A major component of scabies control efforts a strategy based on mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin. Currently diagnosis of scabies relies on clinical examination with a limited role for diagnostic testing. Under the recommendation of the WHO Diagnostic Technical Advisory Group (DTAG) for Neglected Tropical Diseases, a working group was assembled and tasked with agreeing on priority use cases for and developing target product profiles (TPPs) for new diagnostics tools for scabies.",
    "Methodology and principal findings": "The working group convened three times and established two use cases: establishing if the 10% threshold for mass drug administration had been reached and if the 2% threshold for stopping mass drug administration has been achieved. One subgroup assessed the current diagnostic landscape for scabies and a second subgroup determined the test requirements for both use cases. Draft TPPs were sent out for input from stakeholders and experts. Both TPPs considered the following parameters: product use, design, performance, configuration, cost, access and equity. The group considered the use of the tests as a single step process or as part of a two step process following initial clinical examination. When used a single step test (the ideal scenario) for starting MDA a new diagnostic required a sensitivity of \u226592% and a specificity of \u226598%. When used a single step test (the ideal scenario) for stopping MDA a new diagnostic required a sensitivity of \u226580% and a specificity of \u226599%.",
    "Conclusions": "The TPPs developed will provide test developers with guidance to ensure that novel diagnostic tests meet identified public health needs."
