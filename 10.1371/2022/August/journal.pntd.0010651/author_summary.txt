The liver, a critical metabolic organ, consists of approximately 80% parenchymal hepatocytes. Hepatic schistosomiasis results in inflammatory granulomas response and fibrosis formation that inevitably affects hepatocytes. However, whether and how hepatocytes involved in the progression of liver injury caused by S. japonicum is not clear. Here, we found that, the level of FXR, a key regulator of bile acid metabolism in hepatocytes, was clearly decreased in the liver of mice with this worm infection. Further, we found that FXR specifically deficient in hepatocytes increased bile acids toxicity and inhibited hepatocellular autophagy induced by worm infection, which therefore accelerated the progression of schistosomiasis by promoting hepatocyte injuries but not the formation of egg granulomas and hepatic fibrosis. Our work provides a regulatory loop of FXR/bile acids-autophagy in schistosomiasis, which suggests a role of hepatic FXR in the protection from hepatic damages caused by infection with S. japonicum.
