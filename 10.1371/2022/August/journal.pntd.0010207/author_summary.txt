ETEC is one of the top causes of diarrheal diseases in low and middle income countries. The advancement of molecular diagnosis has made it possible to accurately detect ETEC in endemic areas. However, the complexity, infrastructure and cost implication of these tests has made it a challenge to routinely incorporate them in health facilities in endemic settings. The ETEC RLDT is a simple and cost-effective molecular tool that can be used to screen for ETEC in resource limited settings. Here, we described the performance of the RLDT against a qPCR as the gold standard. Our findings showed that the ETEC RLDT performs comparable to the qPCR and would be a suitable screening tool in health facilities in recourse limited settings.
