Scrub typhus is a mite-borne rickettsial illness, which is potentially severe if untreated or diagnosis is delayed or missed. This easily treatable disease is endemic in southeastern and eastern parts of Asia, but is increasingly recognised to have a global distribution. In endemic areas, where infected vectors transmit different strains of Orientia tsutsugamushi—the causative pathogen of scrub typhus—the diversity of these bacterial strains poses a serious obstacle for developing effective diagnostics and a universal scrub typhus vaccine. Comparison studies on the host immune responses against various strains are rare and there is limited evidence on strain-specific immune responses over the disease course.
In this study, we characterized the clinical disease progression from the start of infection to full convalescence in a well-characterised non-human primate rhesus macaque model, infected with the two most prevalent O. tsutsugamushi strains; Karp and Gillam, and compared the time course dynamics of bacteremia with correlations of various immune response mechanisms. We found that Gilliam strain infection associated with higher disease severity, earlier onset of bacteremia, lymph node enlargement, eschar lesions and higher inflammatory markers during the acute phase of infection, when compared to the Karp strain. The findings suggest that a Gilliam strain infection in rhesus macaques provides improved endpoint measurements when compared to Karp strain infections, which is useful for future vaccine development.
