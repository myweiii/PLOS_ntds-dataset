Dengue Fever, a disease caused by infection with dengue virus, is a significant global health problem. Some estimates indicate that ~390 million dengue virus infections occur each year, resulting in ~ 500,000 cases of severe dengue disease which can be fatal. One Dengue virus vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur’s Dengvaxia) has been approved in some countries for people aged 9 to 45 years but has limited effectiveness and the potential for increased risk of severe dengue in seronegative individuals. There are no other drugs or vaccines widely available to prevent or treat dengue virus disease given the European Medicines Agency announced delay in approval decision on Takeda’s TAK-003 candidate. Therefore, development of a drug to treat dengue is a global public health priority. This would be an important tool to go along with vaccination, potentially saving lives and relieving human suffering caused by dengue virus infections around the world. UV-4 is an antiviral drug candidate for dengue virus and additional acute viral diseases. An important attribute of UV-4 is that it does not target the virus directly. This has potential advantages such as preventing the virus from developing resistance to the drug. In previous studies, UV-4 or the hydrochloride salt UV-4B were well tolerated and ameliorated dengue and influenza virus disease in animals. Here, we report the first evaluation of UV-4 hydrochloride administration to healthy human volunteers. UV-4 as the hydrochloride was safe at all doses tested up to 1000 mg. These results support the further development of UV-4 for antiviral activity against dengue or other acute viral diseases.
