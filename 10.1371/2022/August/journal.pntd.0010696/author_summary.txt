Visceral leishmaniasis is a fatal parasitic disease which affects impoverished populations living in remote areas. It has caused very high mortality in South Sudan where several major outbreaks have occurred in the past 40 years. In East Africa, the disease can be successfully treated with a combination of injectable sodium stibogloconate and paromomycin given for 17 days. South Sudan was the first country where this regimen was introduced. Now, nearly 20 years later, our data show that it may have become less effective. In our clinic in Lankien, situated in the middle of the endemic area, more and more patients present with relapsed disease and need to be retreated. We have analysed our data and found that the relapse rate as a proportion of all VL cases has increased by 6.5% per annum since 2003. It is possible that this is caused by treatment-resistant parasite strains. Since there is currently no alternative first line treatment, this is of concern. We have planned a prospective observational study where we will follow patients for 12 months in order to determine the current relapse rate, and we highlight the need for new chemical entities that will enable safe and effective short-course oral treatments.
