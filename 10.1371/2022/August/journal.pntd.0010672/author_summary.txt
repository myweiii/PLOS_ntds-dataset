Buruli ulcer is a chronic skin disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. The disease mainly affects children in West Africa, and the skin ulcers are induced by mycolactone, a toxin produced by the bacteria. The mycolactone diffuses through the skin, killing cells, creating irreversible ulceration, and weakening host immune defenses. However, the cytotoxic pathway induced by mycolactone remains largely unknown. We evaluated the mycolactone-induced cell death pathway by screening host factors using a genome-scale knockout assay in human premonocytic THP-1 cells. We identified 884 genes that are potentially involved in mycolactone-induced cell death, of which SEC61A1, the Î±-subunit of the Sec61 translocon complex, was the highest ranking. Knockout of SEC61A1 in THP-1 cells resulted in suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress and caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by mycolactone. These results suggest that SEC61A1 is an essential mediator of mycolactone-induced cell death.
