Snakebite kills 81,000â€“138,000 people a year and disables another 400,000 mainly in tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia and Latin America. We must be able to correctly identify biting snakes if we want to understand the diversity of snakes that threatens different populations in endemic countries. This is key to improve snakebite epidemiological data and to ensure the appropriate distribution of antivenoms in a given country and the specific treatment of patients with these antivenoms when bitten by prevalent snakes. However, snakes are diverse and healthcare providers lack the expertise to identify them, i.e., victims carry the snake to the hospital or take photos. Here we used thousands of snake photos from across the world and computer vision to develop an AI model to classify snakes. We show for the first time that AI can accurately classify a large diversity of venomous and non-venomous snakes from across the world including lookalike species from snakebite endemic countries. This study sets the foundation for developing global, regional or national snake identification support systems for snakebite epidemiologists and healthcare providers, herpetologists, and the general public.
