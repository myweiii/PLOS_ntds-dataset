The present work shows the current trends in the frequency of neurocysticercosis hospitalizations in four endemic Latin American countries. Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic disease of the central nervous system that has been historically linked to poverty and poor sanitation. It is one of the neglected tropical diseases included in the PAHO/WHO action plan for their elimination. We compiled official data available from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico. Our results show a clear and significant reduction in the disease burden in 3 of the 4 countries included. On the other hand, in Colombia, an increase in incidence was observed. These mixed results are of great relevance. They allow us to be optimistic about the possibility of eliminating this disease in some countries, but also allow us to consider why the disease does not seem to be controlled in other countries and direct public health measures aimed at eliminating this parasite in the countries that need it most.
