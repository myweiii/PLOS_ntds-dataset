Protection against tuberculosis (TB) requires a robust proinflammatory Th1-type immune response with cytokines like TNF and IFN-gamma being vital for cell recruitment and activation of microbicidal mechanisms, and granuloma formation to wall off the bacteria. Lately also the cytokine IL-17 was shown important for TB-protection. Helminths generally trigger a Th2-type immunity which suppresses Th1-type responses having consequences for TB reactivation and disease severity in endemic regions. To study helminths species-specific effects on the cytokine response for TB, which is not fully explored, we recruited patients with active pulmonary TB and healthy community controls (CCs) in Gondar, Ethiopia, and analyzed the Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles including IL-17A in plasma and from isolated and stimulated immune cells (PBMCs). In CCs confirmed not having latent TB we found that Ascaris lumbricoides or Schistosoma mansoni infection suppressed Th1 cytokines and IL-10 in PBMCs. In TB patients, on the other hand, only hookworm infection showed a similar pattern suppressing Th1 cytokines in PBMC, as well as suppressing the elevated systemic levels of IL-17A in plasma. Our findings show that helminths suppress the TB-protective cytokine output in a species-dependent manner whereby certain species possibly increase susceptibility to TB and others more strongly regulate immunity during TB disease.
