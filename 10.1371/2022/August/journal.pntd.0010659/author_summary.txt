Melioidosis is a fatal infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative bacterium called Burkholderia pseudomallei. The bacteria can be found in many parts of the world, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions. Infection displays a variety of symptoms such as pneumonia, organ abscess and septicemia. The latter can lead to death within 24–48 hours if not properly diagnosed and treated. Rapid and accurate diagnosis, consequently, are essential for saving patients’ lives. Currently, culturing B. pseudomallei is a gold standard diagnostic method, but the assay turnaround time is 2–4 days, and the result could be of low sensitivity. Other detection methods such as real-time PCR and serological assays are limited by availability of equipment and by low specificity in endemic areas, respectively. For these reasons, in this study we developed a specific, sensitive and rapid detection assay for B. pseudomallei DNA, that is based on CRISPR-Cas12a system. The CRISPR-Cas12a is a protein-RNA complex that recognizes DNA. The RNA can be reprogramed to guide the detection of any DNA of interest, which in our case B. pseudomallei genomic DNA. Our data showed that this assay exhibited a 100% specificity to B. pseudomallei while discriminating against 10 other pathogens and human. The assay can detect B. pseudomallei DNA in less than one hour and does not require sophisticated equipment.
