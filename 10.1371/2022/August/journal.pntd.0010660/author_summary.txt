Trachoma is an eye disease caused by an infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. It is the principal infectious cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and is one of the 20 neglected tropical diseases which is present in 1,338 districts worldwide with an estimated 154.5 million people living in endemic areas. Globally, the disease was earmarked for elimination as a public health problem by the year 2020 and later extended to the year 2030. The WHO elimination strategy SAFE includes Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement. This paper describes the SAFE activities implemented and actions taken for Mexico to achieve the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem. From the compilation of national and local data and information, it was possible to identify that local and federal political commitment and leadership, effective coordination across health institutions and critical sectors such as water and sanitation agencies, and consistent communication and health promotion activities that supported the implementation of SAFE strategies were determinant in driving trachoma elimination. The model of coordinated work and collaboration serves as a model example for the elimination of trachoma and other Neglected Infectious Diseases in Latin America.
