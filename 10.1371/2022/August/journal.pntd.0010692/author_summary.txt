Ticks are a common blood-sucking parasite, which spread many pathogens that cause serious diseases such as Lyme disease to people. Ixodid ticks can take up to three blood meals in their life. During the long process of waiting for their host in the wild, they have evolved a strong ability to tolerate hunger, which should not take more than a year. To study these tenacious molecular regulatory mechanisms, we conducted the DIA quantitative proteomics technology to perform large-scale protein quantitative research on various tissues of Haemaphysalis longicornis starved for a long time. Through the analysis of thousands of proteins produced by the performed research, the results showed that many proteins in the ticks starved for a long time had expressed quantitative changes such as the increased expression of some synthase enzymes. The large amount of data provided by this study can help to better understand the molecular mechanism of ticksâ€™ long-term hunger tolerance. Although this study focuses on finding possible mechanisms for tick starvation resistance at the protein level, the current findings may well have a bearing on research about special activities such as ultra long-distance space travel in the dormant state of the human body in the future.
