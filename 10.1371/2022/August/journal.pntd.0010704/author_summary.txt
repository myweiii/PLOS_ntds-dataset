Typhoid fever is a major public health concern in endemic regions. Understanding the circulating strains of S. Typhi, could provide insight into the genomic epidemiology and guide in the choice of appropriate antibiotics. In this paper, our aim was to characterize S. Typhi strains causing invasive disease in Kibera, where a high typhoid burden has been described. We also aim to understand the evolutionary history of these strains and how antimicrobial resistance determinants have changed over time. We found that there was low diversity of S. Typhi observed in Kibera isolates with isolates grouping into 4 wgMLST clades and five genotypes. The majority (93.5%) of the isolates belonged to genotype 4.3.1; phylodynamic analysis suggest isolates of this genotype from Kibera are related to other 4.3.1 isolates from Africa and this genotype has been introduced multiple times in Kibera. This genotype in particular warrants close monitoring to inform antibiotic strategy in this population. Furthermore, concurrent detection of gene markers for MDR and quinolone resistance in some isolates raise concern about the potential emergence of extensive drug resistant (XDR) strains. Additional surveillance is needed in Kibera to monitor changing trends in resistance that may require altering clinical treatment, and to inform other preventive measures such as typhoid-conjugate vaccine introduction.
