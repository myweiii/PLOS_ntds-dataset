Snakes of the genus Bothrops are responsible for most snakebite accidents in Latin America. Bothrops moojeni, a venomous member of this genus, is of particular medical importance in Brazil. Despite significant advances in the study of the pathogenesis of systemic and local effects induced by Bothrops venom, the target tissues and their responses to envenomation are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of B. moojeni venom (Bmv) on preadipocytes, focusing on the release of inflammatory mediators, lipid accumulation and mechanisms involved in PGE2 production. Our results show that Bmv induced an inflammatory response in preadipocytes, with activation of the NF-ÎºB signalling pathway, release of the inflammatory mediators PGE2, IL-6 and KC and expression of COX-2. Furthermore, we show that engagement of the EP1 receptor potentiates PGE2 biosynthesis by positive feedback. Bmv also induced lipid accumulation in differentiating preadipocytes. These results indicate that adipose tissue cells may be another target for Bmv and highlight the importance of the adipose tissue as a source of inflammatory mediators during Bothrops envenomation, providing a new perspective for studies of this envenomation. Besides contributing to systemic effects, the mediators released by adipose tissue cells following activation by Bothrops venom may intensify local effects.
