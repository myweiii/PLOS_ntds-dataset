A fatal human case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occurred in a patient from the Tiwi Islands of northern Australia in February 2021. The Tiwi Islands are 80km north of Darwin in the Timor Sea. Attempts to culture the virus from post-mortem brain tissue were unsuccessful. However, the whole genome was successfully sequenced and compared phylogenetically to other JE viruses. The Tiwi Islands strain was shown to belong to the rarely detected genotype IV (GIV) of the JE virus (JEV), together with the Australian 2022 outbreak strain, and is only the second fatal case of JE associated with a GIV virus. JEV strains isolated from Indonesia in 2017 and 2019 were shown to be the most-closely-related to the Australian GIV strain providing evidence for the geographic origins of the emergent Australian virus. From evolutionary analysis, the clade containing the Australian and recent Indonesian viruses was estimated to have emerged between 1998 and 2014, suggesting that this lineage of GIV viruses has been circulating for several years before the Tiwi Islands case. This is the third JEV genotype to be detected in Australia and demonstrates the ease with which new genotypes can spread and unexpectedly cause disease in new areas. The possible origin and risks of further incursions into Australia are discussed.
