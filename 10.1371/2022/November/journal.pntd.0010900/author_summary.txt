Lymphatic filariasis (LF) remains an important public health issues in endemic areas in Indonesia. One potential challenge to achieving LF elimination is the risk posed by never treatment during mass drug administration (MDA). Although Ambon City in Maluku Province, Indonesia, initiated its annual MDA in 2009, the microfilaria rate in 2016 still exceeded the threshold for elimination as a public health problem. In 2018 and 2019, we conducted a community-based study in the catchment areas of Air Salobar and Waihaong Health Centers, Ambon to improve treatment coverage and reduce the coverage-compliance gap in MDA for LF. Using data from the two cross-sectional surveys, our analysis examined factors associated with never treatment. We found the role of employment, healthcare catchment area, perceived possibility of side effects after swallowing LF drugs, difficulties in swallowing and remembering when to swallow all LF drugs and knowledge of how to swallow LF drugs were associated with the likelihood of never treatment. Recommendations to improve MDA uptake include the need to reassure community members about side effects, provide specific instructions on how to take LF drugs, and promote the message that MDA participation is part of oneâ€™s contribution to community health.
