Aedes aegypti is one of the most important mosquito species because females can potentially carry pathogens that cause disease. These diseases have a tremendous impact worldwide making this species an important target of control.
We evaluated a mosquito control strategy independently of the company that developed the method while the company tested it in Harris County, TX. The strategy relies on a bacterium (Wolbachia sp) that causes changes in the sperm of infected males, preventing uninfected female mosquitoes from producing viable eggs (phenomenon known as cytoplasmic incompatibility). Wolbachia-infected males are released in large numbers (inundative releases) to outcompete wild-type Wolbachia-free males and reduce the population of existing Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.
We observed a sustained reductions > 90% in the number of females very likely because of the intervention conducted in Harris County, TX. The results we observed were very similar to observations made by others in Miami, FL and in Fresno, CA. However, more experiments (following randomized cluster designs) should be performed to increase the statistical power while controlling for environmental factors that could contribute to fluctuations in mosquito populations and trapping variations.
