Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. The disease remains often silent for years, and some patients never experience any symptoms at all. If the disease becomes symptomatic, symptoms are manifold but most commonly patients suffer from epileptic seizures or headache. Symptoms depend on the location, number and stage of the NCC lesions. Radiological features of NCC differ between world regions and are still understudied for African populations. In this study, we describe radiological but also clinical features of NCC patients with and without epileptic seizures. We found that around one third of patients with epileptic seizures had NCC typical lesions in their brain. Most patients had multiple parenchymal lesionsâ€“patients with epileptic seizures had on average more lesions than asymptomatic patients. Patients with epileptic seizures and NCC more commonly had focal onset seizure than patients with epileptic seizures without NCC.
