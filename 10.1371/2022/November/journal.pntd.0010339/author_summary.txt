Rift Valley fever (RVF) affects humans and livestock across Africa, South West Indian Ocean islands, and the Arabian Peninsula. This disease is one of the World Health Organization priorities and is caused by a virus which is transmitted by mosquitoes (mainly of Aedes and Culex spp. genera), but also by direct contact from livestock to humans. Mathematical models have been used in the last 20 years to disentangle RVF virus transmission dynamics. These models can further improve our understanding of processes driving outbreaks, test the efficiency of control strategies, or even anticipate possible emergence. Provided with detailed datasets, models can tailor their conclusions to specific geographical contexts and aid in decision-making in the field. This review provides a general overview of mathematical models developed to study RVF virus transmission dynamics. We describe their main results and methodological choices, and identify hurdles to be lifted. To offer innovative animal and public health value, we recommend that future models focus on the relative contribution of host and vector species to transmission, and the role of animal mobility.
