The emerging tick-borne Rickettsia pathogens have a major impact on human health worldwide. In previous studies, R. massiliae has been isolated and recognized as a human pathogen in Italy, southern France and Argentina. The first isolation of R. massiliae from Rhipicephalus ticks was reported in Maresille and was further found in Greece, Spain, Portugul, Switzerland, Sicily, Central Africa, and Mali. Our previous studies have found various Rickettsia (R. parkeri-like, R. honei, and R. felis) in Ixodes granulatus and Rh. sanguineus ticks in Taiwan area. In this study, R. massiliae was firstly detected in Rh. sanguineus ticks infested on dogs. As a companion animal for humans, the first detection of human pathogenic strain of R. massiliae in Rh. sanguineus ticks from dogs may imply the potential threat for the regional transmission of Rickettsia infection among humans in Taiwan.
