We thank the US National Science Foundation (NSF) through Ecohealth net (https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/program/ecohealthnet) for their scientific support, the Ituri province authorities for their administrative support and the village health care workers (RECO) and guides for their assistance in carrying out the field surveys. The Uganda-DRC crossborder studies were supported by APOC, The Carter Center and SightSavers. We are also grateful to the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren and the Natural History Museum in London for allowing us access to their important collections of African Simuliidae, and for supplying us with the on-site facilities to examine the specimens. We also thank them and Frans Breteler (Herbarium Vadense) for sharing their taxonomic expertise and advice.
