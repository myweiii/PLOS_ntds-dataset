River blindness (= onchocerciasis) is a severely debilitating disease caused by the nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus, and in Africa it is known to be transmitted from person to person by blood-sucking blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae) of the Simulium damnosum complex, the S. neavei group and (rarely) by S. albivirgulatum. Using classical morphological characteristics and DNA analysis we have unexpectedly identified the vector blackfly as S. dentulosum (and possibly S. vorax) in a small endemic area (the Kakoi-Koda focus) which has been recently discovered on the western slopes of the rift valley in the Democratic Republic of Congo above Lake Albert. In the surrounding endemic areas, the vectors are S. damnosum complex and/or S. neavei (as normally expected), and because S. dentulosum is not a vector in these surrounding areas, it follows that this focus is entomologically isolated from immigrant blackfly species which might otherwise have carried new infections into the Kakoi-Koda focus (and vice-versa). This is of local importance, because it makes elimination of the parasite easier, but our findings have wider significance across Africa, because they raise the possibility that under the right conditions, other common and widely-distributed blackfly species might unexpectedly become human-biters and significant vectors.
