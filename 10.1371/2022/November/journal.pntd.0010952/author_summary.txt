Scrub typhus is a leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in endemic regions, but its clinical features and case fatality rate are not yet fully described. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis and found that adults with neurological scrub typhus commonly present with headache and neck stiffness, whilst children present with altered sensorium and seizure activity. Signs classically associated with scrub typhus such as eschar and lymphadenopathy were not commonly reported. Just under 4% of patients with neurological manifestations of scrub typhus die in hospital, and the case fatality rate may be higher in children. Clinicians should have a low threshold to start empiric treatment for scrub typhus when patients present with neurological infections in endemic regions.
