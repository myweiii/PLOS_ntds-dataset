Loiasis is a typically-mild filarial worm disease. In contrast, lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis are diseases of significant public health concern. LF and onchocerciasis are primarily controlled by administering chemotherapeutics to entire at-risk human populations. However, individuals with heavy loiasis infections are at risk of severe adverse events when treated with these drugs. Accurate loiasis surveillance is therefore critical to the safe implementation of these programmes.
Screening humans to detect parasites in the blood is invasive and expensive at large scale. Recently, however, several studies have demonstrated the potential of collecting wild blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes and screening them for the presence of human blood-borne parasites. To explore the potential of mosquito screening as a non-invasive tool for loiasis surveillance, we collected mosquitoes in a known loiasis transmission area in Cameroon. We tested the samples for parasites that cause loiasis, and concurrently screened for the parasites that cause malaria, LF and mansonellosis to determine the potential for integrated disease surveillance. The DNA of all four parasites were identified using these methods. The findings suggest mosquito screening may provide a useful tool for the surveillance of loiasis alongside other parasitic diseases.
