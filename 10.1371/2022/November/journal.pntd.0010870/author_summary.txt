Neurocysticercosis is a neglected zoonotic disease caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Patients with neurocysticercosis show a wide range of symptoms, from asymptomatic to severely affected by epileptic seizures, progressive headache or focal neurological deficits. Epileptic seizures are particularly common and up to 30% of people with epilepsy have neurocysticercosis in areas endemic for Taenia solium. The disease is often undiagnosed in Africa because of a lack of diagnostic opportunities (serological tests and neuroimaging). Furthermore, symptoms are too unspecific to diagnose patients solely based on clinical characteristics. Moreover, radiological features of neurocysticercosis differ between continents and have not been described yet for African populations. In this study, for the first time, we describe radiological but also clinical features of patients with epilepsy and neurocysticercosis in eastern Africa. We found that in Tanzania, Malawi and Uganda, neurocysticercosis is common in people with epilepsy although less common than previously reported. Also, most patients with neurocysticercosis have multiple parenchymal lesions and clinical features of people with epilepsy and neurocysticercosis do not differ substantially from people with epilepsy without neurocysticercosis.
