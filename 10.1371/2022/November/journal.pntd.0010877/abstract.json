    "Abstract": "The live attenuated tetravalent CYD-TDV vaccine (Dengvaxia) is effective but has scarcely been used due to safety concerns among seronegative recipients. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which can accurately determine individual dengue serostatus are needed for use in pre-vaccination screening. This study aimed to determine the performance of existing RDTs (which have been designed to detect levels of immunoglobulin G, IgG, associated with acute post-primary dengue) when repurposed for detection of previous dengue infection (where concentrations of IgG are typically lower). A convenience sample of four-hundred-and-six participants including 217 children were recruited during a community serosurvey. Whole blood was collected by phlebotomy and tested using Bioline Dengue IgG/IgM (Abbott) and Standard Q Dengue IgM/IgG (SD Biosensor) RDTs in the field. Serum samples from the same individuals were also tested at National Health Laboratory. The Panbio indirect IgG ELISA was used as a reference test. Reference testing determined that 370 (91.1%) participants were dengue IgG seropositive. Both assays were highly specific (100.0%) but had low sensitivity (Bioline = 21.1% and Standard Q = 4.6%) when used in the field. Sensitivity was improved when RDTs were used under laboratory conditions, and when assays were allowed to run beyond manufacturer recommendations and read at a delayed time-point, but specificity was reduced. Efforts to develop RDTs with high sensitivity and specificity for prior dengue infection which can be operationalised for pre-vaccination screening are ongoing. Performance of forthcoming candidate assays should be tested under field conditions with blood samples, as well as in the laboratory."
