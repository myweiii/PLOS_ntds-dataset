The global scale of COVID-19 is unprecedented. Malaysia has experienced several waves of infection, leading to an overwhelmed health system. Nonetheless, reported cases remain an inaccurate estimate of the true disease burden within the population. We approximated the infection fatality ratio using an estimated adjusted age-specific case fatality ratio. We then estimate the true number of infections that have occurred in Malaysia. A total of 9.95 million cases are estimated to have occurred amongst Malaysians between March 2020 and December 2021. This figure corresponds to 32.8% of the total population of Malaysians. These findings suggest that community immunity remains low, and a great deal of the population remains susceptible. Booster doses and periodic strong public health measures may be required for the foreseeable future.
