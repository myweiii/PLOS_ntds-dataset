Female genital schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease, acquired by humans when exposed to infested water. Patients can develop severe gynaecologic symptoms and face psychological and social problems. Although urogenital schistosomiasis is very common in many communities in Sub-Sahara Africa, knowledge on FGS among community members and health care workers is poor. Knowledge and experiences of women affected by FGS have never been explored but need to be understood to provide effective health care and to promote adequate interventions.
In this study, waterborne and sexual transmission were the most recurrently mentioned pathways for FGS acquisition. Most women perceived the risk for FGS as immutable and related to the precarious living conditions. The women were able to differentiate between urinary and female genital schistosomiasis. FGS caused partnership conflicts and affected womenâ€™s position in the community. Stigma within the community and mistrust in health care resulted in delayed seeking health care. In view of these results, we propose including health education and structural interventions to improve living conditions, in order to reduce the burden of FGS. Further, improved access to correct diagnosis and treatment should be provided.
