Arboviral infections pose an increasing risk to global health. As most of them predominantly circulate in (sub-)tropical regions comprised of low-resource countries and affect already vulnerable populations, these diseases have an immense impact on the socio-economic sector. Worldwide, the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) represents one of the most important arboviruses. Yet, despite its significance, reliable data to understand many populations’ real disease burden is still lacking. One example is the South Pacific Region (SPR), which has been severely affected by numerous CHIKV outbreaks since 2011. Epidemiological data is indispensable for the implementation of strategies for optimal allocation of limited resources, efficient early intervention, and vector control as well as to understand the virus’ geographical distribution and its contribution to global morbidity. We therefore conducted a CHIKV seroprevalence study in the local populations of two Pacific Island states–the Cook Islands and Vanuatu. Our results show that about 30% of the local population has been affected during the 2014/2015 CHIKV epidemic on the Cook Islands. Although no outbreak was ever officially reported in Vanuatu, a notable part of the respective test population was also proven to have been exposed to CHIKV. By comparing our two study settings we further identified several environmental and social factors with potential outbreak modifying effect.
