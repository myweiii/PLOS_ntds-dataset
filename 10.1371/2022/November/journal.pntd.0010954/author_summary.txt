The rapid expansion of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations prompted the development of novel control strategies, such as RNA interference (RNAi). As the only member of the phosphagen kinase family in insects, arginine kinase (AK) plays an important role in insect energy metabolism, however, characterization of mosquito AK is still limited. We cloned the full-length cDNAs encoding CpAK1 and CpAK2 from Cx. pipiens pallens, and investigated their spatial-temporal expression patterns as well as the effects of RNAi-mediated knockdown of CpAK1 and CpAK2 on mosquito reproduction and blood-feeding behavior. We found that the expression levels of both CpAK1 and CpAK2 were upregulated in response to blood feeding, and knockdown CpAKs led to high mortalities of adult female mosquitoes and decreased hatchabilities. The blood feeding rate and the engorgement rate of the female mosquitoes were negatively affected by co-injection of dsRNAs targeting CpAK1 and CpAK2. The findings of this study indicate that technology based on RNAi of AK might provide a new way to control mosquito vectors.
