In this study, the fusion gene TsCRT+TsSP1.1 was designed and synthesized, the fusion gene TsCRT+TsSP1.1, individual TsCRT or TsSP1.1 was used to construct the DNA vaccines. Oral vaccination with TsCRT+TsSP1.1 in combination elicited obviously higher level of serum specific antibody, mucosal sIgA and cellular response, and immune protection than either of single TsCRT or TsSP1.1 DNA vaccination. Moreover, vaccination with TsCRT+TsSP1.1, TsCRT and TsSP1.1 also obviously relieved intestinal and muscle inflammatory reaction in vaccinated mice after challenge. The results indicated that TsCRT and TsSP1.1 might be regarded as the novel potential targets for anti-Trichinella vaccines.
