Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) is a deforming leishmaniasis clinical form related to functional damage and stigmatization. This disease is caused mainly by L. braziliensis and predominates in neglected populations in the Americas, where approximately 2000 cases occur per year. There are few ML clinical trials, which makes the current treatment supported by fragile scientific evidence. In this study, we carried out an extensive literature search to gather the accumulated evidence for ML treatment. Twenty-seven studies with different designs were included with a total of 1,666 patients with ML treated. The results confirmed that antimony is still the main drug used for ML treatment, with only a moderate cure rate, an efficacy possibly increased by pentoxifylline combination. Miltefosine was found to be an alternative, with a cure rate similar to antimonials standard doses. In turn, the high toxicity of amphotericin B deoxycholate was clearly demonstrated, generating low cure rates due to early interruption of treatment. Other alternatives such as pentamidine, imidazoles, and aminosidine, were evaluated in a small number of cases and presented variable cure rates. The quality of the studies is low, and there is great heterogeneity in the definitions of cure, which limits a global analysis of the data. More and well-designed studies are needed to guide ML treatment recommendations.
