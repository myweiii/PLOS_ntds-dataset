    "Background": "Clonorchis sinensis requires bile acid transporters as this fluke inhabits bile juice-filled biliary ducts, which provide an extreme environment. Clonorchis sinensis sodium-bile acid co-transporter (CsSBAT) is indispensable for the fluke\u2019s survival in the final host, as it circulates taurocholate and prevents bile toxicity in the fluke; hence, it is recognized as a useful drug target.",
    "Methodology and principal findings": "In the present study, using structure-based virtual screening approach, we presented inhibitor candidates targeting a bile acid-binding pocket of CsSBAT. CsSBAT models were built using tertiary structure modeling based on a bile acid transporter template (PDB ID: 3zuy and 4n7x) and were applied into AutoDock Vina for competitive docking simulation. First, potential compounds were identified from PubChem (holding more than 100,000 compounds) by applying three criteria: i) interacting more favorably with CsSBAT than with a human homolog, ii) intimate interaction to the inward- and outward-facing conformational states, iii) binding with CsSBAT preferably to natural bile acids. Second, two compounds were identified following the Lipinski\u2019s rule of five. Third, other two compounds of molecular weight higher than 500 Da (Mr > 500 Da) were presumed to efficiently block the transporter via a feasible rational screening strategy. Of these candidates, compound 9806452 exhibited the least hepatotoxicity that may enhance drug-likeness properties.",
    "Conclusions": "It is proposed that compound 9806452 act as a potential inhibitor toward CsSBAT and further studies are warranted for drug development process against clonorchiasis."
