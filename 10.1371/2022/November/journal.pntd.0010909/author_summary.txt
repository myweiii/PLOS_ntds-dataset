Clonorchis sinensis, the Chinese liver fluke, is a parasite infecting human. People are infected via ingesting raw freshwater fishes carrying C. sinensis metacercariae, the encysted form of larvae. Clonorchiasis is a disease caused by C. sinensis, which affects primarily the host hepatobiliary organs. World Health Organization has classified C. sinensis as a biological carcinogen inducing cholangiocarcinoma. Praziquantel has been a therapeutical choice for clonorchiasis. However, the flukes resistant to the drug have emerged due to the extensive use of it. Hence, it is necessary to develop new chemotherapeutic agents to outwit the drug-resistant worms. Sodium-dependent bile acid transporter of C. sinensis (CsSBAT) is essential for the survival of C. sinensis in the bile environment. When CsSBAT is inhibited, bile acids accumulate in the wormâ€™s tissues and cells, which are detrimental to the survival of the worm. Structure-based virtual screening is a powerful approach for compound identification and drug development. Here, we prepared CsSBAT structures using tertiary structure modeling and refinement. We identified four putative inhibitory compounds, which competitively targeted the bile acid-binding pocket of CsSBAT. One inhibitor candidate revealed the least oral toxicity and hepatotoxicity that may enhance its druggability.
