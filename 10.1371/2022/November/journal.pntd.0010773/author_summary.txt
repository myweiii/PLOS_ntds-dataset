To successfully eliminate malaria, highly effective vaccines against the two major human malaria species, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, will be needed. Vaccines against the blood form of malaria generate antibodies that target specific proteins on the Plasmodium parasite to reduce its replication within the host. Studying the antibody response after natural malaria infection can help identify blood markers of parasite exposure and also shed light on the magnitude and longevity of antibodies to vaccine candidate proteins. We performed a study to determine the frequency, magnitude, and longevity of natural antibody responses against nine P. vivax vaccine candidate proteins in patients with vivax malaria in Brazil. These proteins were selected based on prior studies demonstrating that antibodies against these proteins were either associated with protection against vivax malaria or have been tested as blood markers of recent infection with vivax malaria. Here, we identified specific vivax proteins that produce more frequent and longer-lived antibody responses in this population.
