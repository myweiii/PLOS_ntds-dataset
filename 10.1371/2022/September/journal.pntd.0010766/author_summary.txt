Fasciolosis caused by the helminth parasite Fasciola hepatica is a serious health and economic problem worldwide. Treatment and prevention of this disease pose several drawbacks that have so far not been solved. The definition of suitable parasite molecular targets to overcome such drawbacks should be based on thoroughly deciphering host-parasite interactions, and in this regard most studies have focused on the adult stages of F. hepatica. Nevertheless, in this context, the study of the transient juvenile stages of this parasite could be of higher utility due to the importance of early interactions with the host for parasite migration and the successful establishment of infection. In this work, we set-up an ex vivo model and performed a quantitative proteomics approach to study the changes in F. hepatica juveniles upon gut passage. We found that the parasite tegument and somatic compartments experienced deep changes in their composition and showed that the host triggers the expression of specific molecules that are important for parasite migration and survival at this stage. The molecules described here could serve to better understand host-parasite interactions and to define new targets against fasciolosis.
