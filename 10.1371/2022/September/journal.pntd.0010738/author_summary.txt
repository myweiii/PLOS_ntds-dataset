Our analysis of the last 40 years of reported Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) in California included cases that met specific inclusion criteria which highlighted new information. First, there are two distinct epidemiologic patterns which are illustrated with detailed descriptions of two fatal cases. The typical sylvatic cycle involves transmission by Dermacentor spp. ticks in grassland or woodland habitats. A peridomestic cycle exists that involves transmission by the brown dog tick, Rh. sanguineus, often in association with travel to hyper-endemic areas such as certain parts of northern Mexico or resulting from the increasing presence of Rh. sanguineus in Southern California. Second, the typical clinical picture of fever, headache, chills, and rash emphasized the non-specific nature of this life-threatening disease. Inquiries regarding recent tick exposure in both the sylvatic and peridomestic environments can help in recognition of the disease. Lastly, while RMSF remains rare in California, incidence is increasing, notably in the Hispanic/Latino population. Public health messaging about RMSF in California must focus on both sylvatic and peridomestic settings, particularly in Southern California, and should be culturally appropriate.
