    "Abstract": "Cytokines and chemokines are immune response molecules that display diverse functions, such as inflammation and immune regulation. In Plasmodium vivax infections, the uncontrolled production of these molecules is thought to contribute to pathogenesis and has been proposed as a possible predictor for disease complications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytokine profile of P. vivax malaria patients with different clinical outcomes to identify possible immune biomarkers for severe P. vivax malaria. The study included patients with non-severe (n = 56), or severe (n = 50) P. vivax malaria and healthy controls (n = 50). Patient plasma concentrations of IL-4, IL-2, CXCL10, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, CCL2, IL-17A, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12p70, CXCL8 and active TGF-\u03b21 were determined through flow cytometry. The levels of several cytokines and chemokines, CXCL10, IL-10, IL-6, IL-4, CCL2 and IFN-\u03b3 were found to be significantly higher in severe, compared to non-severe P. vivax malaria patients. Severe thrombocytopenia was positively correlated with IL-4, CXCL10, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 levels, renal dysfunction was related to an increase in IL-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-17A and IL-8, and hepatic impairment with CXCL10, MCP-1, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3. A Lasso regression model suggests that IL-4, IL-10, CCL2 and TGF-\u03b2 might be developed as biomarkers for severity in P. vivax malaria. Severe P. vivax malaria patients present specific cytokine and chemokine profiles that are different from non-severe patients and that could potentially be developed as biomarkers for disease severity."
