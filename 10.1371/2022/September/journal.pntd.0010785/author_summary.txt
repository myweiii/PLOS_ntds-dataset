Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) that predominantly affects poor and vulnerable populations. It is estimated that around six million people are infected with T. cruzi, most of them in endemic areas of Latin American countries. It is recommended that individuals with CD be followed up by health services through one to two medical consultations per year. Identifying groups of people with CD who are more vulnerable in relation to their health status, whether due to the unavailability of health services or the types of behavior that lead to the non-use of available services, can contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality from the disease. Our study evaluated the prevalence of non-use of health services in the last year by 1,160 people with CD in an endemic area in Brazil and the contextual and individual factors associated with this non-use. The study results showed that almost a quarter of these patients had not had a medical appointment in the last year. “Living in cities with a larger population” and “having a lower severity of the disease” influenced the non-use of the health service in the last year by these patients. These results reinforce the need for public policies that consider the contextual determinants of the use of health services by populations affected by the disease.
