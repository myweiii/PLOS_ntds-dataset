In this study, we show (1) that two main factors can explain the lower numbers of cases and deaths per inhabitants in Africa: an underestimation (by a factor 8.5) of the reported cases and deaths which directly results from the under capacities of the health systems at country level, but also a genuine effect by a factor 5.1 directly resulting from the smaller fraction of elderly people. We demonstrate (2) that the dynamics of the epidemic can be approximated deterministically by few variables only. Its time evolution is however highly sensitive to the initial conditions which makes it unpredictable at long term. Moreover, dynamics can largely vary from one country to another. For one country (Ghana), it is shown that very different epidemiological evolution can occur under strictly identical sanitary conditions. Finally, we reveal (3) that the impact of the control measures on the contact number is effective at short term and enabled to maintain the epidemic at a relatively low level, but it is more difficult to identify distinctly the long-term role of mitigation strategy. The omicron variant is very clearly detected in the recent evolution of the epidemic.
