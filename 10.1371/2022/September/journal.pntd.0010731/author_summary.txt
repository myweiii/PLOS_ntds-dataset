Neglected intestinal parasitic infections, such as soil-transmitted helminthes, have been identified as a major public health issue in the worldâ€™s poorest communities. Women of reproductive age, especially pregnant women, are at a particular risk from soil transmitted helminthiasis which results in morbidities such as anemia. Deworming is one strategy for reducing the burden of intestinal parasites in pregnant women. Little is known about levels of deworming utilization and its determinants among pregnant women in Ethiopia. We used national survey data from approximately 7590 pregnant women to assess deworming utilization and its individual and community-level determinants in Ethiopia. We found that the level of utilization of deworming was very low, there is a higher uptake of deworming medication among womens who have an occupation, media exposure, desired pregnancy, ante natal care visit and pregnant women with low level community poverty. Our findings have important implications for scaling up the utilization of anthelminthic treatment for pregnant women.
