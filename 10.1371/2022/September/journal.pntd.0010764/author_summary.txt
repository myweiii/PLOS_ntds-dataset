India is the highest-burden country in the world where leprosy is known to cluster in hamlets. As no geographical data about hamlets is available, we develop a system to outline them using a high-resolution population density map. Then, using the household coordinates of 169 new leprosy cases enrolled in two hyperendemic blocks of Bihar, we screened household contacts and assessed clustering at hamlet level. The patients interviewed had lived in their current villages for a median of seventeen years at the moment of the survey. We found 11 new cases among 658 contacts examined equivalent to 16.7 per 1,000 population. There were three statistically significant clusters among five at the hamlet level and three including 78 cases in 98,623 population. Our results can be used to guide targeted and more efficient active case finding and post-exposure prophylaxis.
