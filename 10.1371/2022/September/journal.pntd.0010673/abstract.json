    "Background": "Podoconiosis is endemic non-filarial elephantiasis and non-infective neglected tropical disease. It has a wide impact on the physical, social and psychological aspects of the well-being of a person. However, limited information is available about the disease burden on health-related quality of life and associated factors in Ethiopia.",
    "Objective": "This study aimed is to determine health-related quality of life and associated factors among adult podoconiosis patients in Debre Elias district, Northwest, Ethiopia.",
    "Methods": "A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 1 to March 30, 2020 in the Debre Elias district. A multi-stage stratified; systematic random sampling technique was employed to select 403 podoconiosis patients. The data were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi data version 4.6 and exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. After the assumption check for the linear regression model, simple and multiple regression was done to see the association between the predictor and outcome variables. Predictor variables that had p-value <0.2 at simple linear regression were taken into multiple linear regression. \u03b2 coefficient with 95% CI and p-value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant variables in multiple linear regression analysis.",
    "Result": "The overall mean quality of life score among podoconiosis patients was 61.93\u00b117.14. The mean quality of life score for the physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains were 75.57\u00b121.86, 60.43\u00b118.58, 30.34\u00b110.46, and 81.38\u00b122.77 respectively. Foot care had a statically significant association with all domains. Higher quality of life podoconiosis patients was associated with foot care. Lower quality of life was associated with the presence of anxiety, advanced stage of the disease, and frequent adenolymphangitis attack.",
    "Conclusion": "Social and psychological domains of quality of life were lowest as compared to physical and environmental domains of quality of life. Early medical treatment, psychosocial support, and home-based foot care should be encouraged to improve the quality of life in podoconiosis patients."
