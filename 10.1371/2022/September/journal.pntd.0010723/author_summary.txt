Snakebite is a significant public health issue in the tropics, and the rural farming communities in developing countries are at the greatest risk of snakebite. The acute effects of snakebite are often emphasized in the literature. There is a severe dearth of prospective studies to obtain reliable data about the long-term impact. We aimed to describe the long-term health effects perceived by patients followed up after confirmed snakebites. We followed up 199 and 168 confirmed snakebite patients from a snakebite cohort in rural Sri Lanka four and one year after snakebite. One-third of the patients after one year and half of the patients after four years reported various long-term effects attributed to the snakebite, suggesting the proportion with health issues increases with time. However, only sixteen patients (all viperine bites) had permanent musculoskeletal problems, none with a significant functional disability affecting daily routine. Many patients complain of various non-specific and oral symptoms that they perceived as effects of the snakebite. Although these symptoms were more common in patients with systemic envenoming and viper bites, they cannot be explained as venom-induced effects, warranting a broader socio-cultural explanation.
