The Aedes aegypti mosquito is an invasive species on Madeira Island and recently responsible for a dengue outbreak that affected more than 2000 people. To help control the activity of this mosquito, the local health authorities have an entomological surveillance program in place throughout the island. However, the full extent of the areas that can be colonized by this species remains unknown. We estimate the current and future potential distribution of Ae. aegypti on Madeira Island accounting for climatic, land use and human settlement conditions. Our results suggest that suitable conditions are predominantly distributed along the southern coast of the island. However, as climate change progresses, climatically suitable areas are expected to increase, particularly at mid-altitudes and in eastern part of the island. Minimum temperature of the coldest month was the most influential predictor variable in climatic suitability models, while human population density, housing density and public spaces were the most influential in models of land use and human settlement suitability. Our work provides valuable insight on the potential distribution of Ae. aegypti on Madeira Island, which can be used to inform ongoing and future monitoring and prevention initiatives.
