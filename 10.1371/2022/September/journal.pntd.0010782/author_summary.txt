Toxoplasmosis is an important zoonotic disease that represents a concern to captive neotropical primates, due to its high susceptibility, with quick lethal course. Large studies of the pathology and epidemiology of toxoplasmosis in in wildlife neotropical primates are rare, rendering it difficult to evaluate the impact of this disease in free-ranging population. This study investigated toxoplasmosis-induced deaths in 1,001 free-ranging marmosets, describing its epidemiology, pathology, and diagnostic tools. Also, this study highlights the importance of histopathology in the differential diagnosis of other important zoonotic diseases that may circulate in that population, such as Yellow Fever.
