Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is important in understanding the genetic diversity, genomic epidemiology, and transmission chain of emerging viruses of concern. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a zoonotic vector-borne infectious disease with a high mortality rate. Approximately 170 SFTS cases are reported annually in Republic of Korea. We assessed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based NGS method for whole-genome sequencing of SFTS virus (SFTSV) and monitored the prevalence of SFTSV in wild ticks. We developed an amplicon-based NGS method to obtain whole-genome sequences of SFTSV using the nanopore sequencing. A total of 6,593 ticks were collected from Gyeonggi and Gangwon Provinces in 2019 and 2020. The infection and minimum infection rates of SFSTV were 0.34% and 0.05%, respectively. We recovered whole-genome sequences of SFTSV from three Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks collected from Pocheon and Cheorwon, enhancing the high-resolution phylogeographical analysis for potential prevention of SFTS outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SFTSV Hl20-8 from Cheorwon was a reassortant compatible with the B-1 and B-2 sub-genotypes. Our findings provide important insights into the target enrichment-based NGS and genetic diversity for the genome-based diagnosis of SFTSV in the endemic outbreak.
