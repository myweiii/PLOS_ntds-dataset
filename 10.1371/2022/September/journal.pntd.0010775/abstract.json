    "Background": "Understanding the burden of snakebite is crucial for developing evidence-informed strategies to pursue the goal set by the World Health Organization to halve morbidity and mortality of snakebite by 2030. However, there was no such information in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.",
    "Methodology": "A decision analytic model was developed to estimate annual burden of snakebite in seven countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Myanmar. Country-specific input parameters were sought from published literature, country\u2019s Ministry of Health, local data, and expert opinion. Economic burden was estimated from the societal perspective. Costs were expressed in 2019 US Dollars (USD). Disease burden was estimated as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate a 95% credible interval (CrI).",
    "Principal findings": "We estimated that annually there were 242,648 snakebite victims (95%CrI 209,810\u2013291,023) of which 15,909 (95%CrI 7,592\u201333,949) were dead and 954 (95%CrI 383\u20131,797) were amputated. We estimated that 161,835 snakebite victims (69% of victims who were indicated for antivenom treatment) were not treated with antivenom. Annual disease burden of snakebite was estimated at 391,979 DALYs (95%CrI 187,261\u2013836,559 DALYs) with total costs of 2.5 billion USD (95%CrI 1.2\u20135.4 billion USD) that were equivalent to 0.09% (95%CrI 0.04\u20130.20%) of the region\u2019s gross domestic product. >95% of the estimated burdens were attributed to premature deaths.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "The estimated high burden of snakebite in ASEAN was demonstrated despite the availability of domestically produced antivenoms. Most burdens were attributed to premature deaths from snakebite envenoming which suggested that the remarkably high burden of snakebite could be averted. We emphasized the importance of funding research to perform a comprehensive data collection on epidemiological and economic burden of snakebite to eventually reveal the true burden of snakebite in ASEAN and inform development of strategies to tackle the problem of snakebite."
