Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease that is quite common in Ethiopia. This is caused by Leishmania aethiopica, which results in severe lesions that do not seem to respond well to treatment. In Ethiopia, sodium stibogluconate is the most widely used treatment for leishmaniasis, but data on the effectiveness of intralesional sodium stibogluconate for localized CL is scarce. We recorded treatment outcomes and adverse events of patients with localized CL lesions who were treated with intralesional SSG up to six times with one injection administered every week. Patients were followed for 90 days, after which the cure rate was assessed. Among 83 patients enrolled, 72 were seen for outcome assessment. Less than 60% of patients were cured, despite having received at least 5 doses of treatment. Almost all patients reported injection site pain as a side-effect. The low cure rate and a high proportion of patients reporting pain indicate that intralesional sodium stibogluconate is not ideal as a treatment regimen. Cryotherapy or thermo therapy could be a better alternative, but a comparative clinical trial is needed to provide concrete evidence as to which treatment should be recommended.
