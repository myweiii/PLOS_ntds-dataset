Here, we report our results from a pull-down assay and ELISA, which identified Ae. aegypti salivary gland proteins that interact with one or more of five human receptor proteins. Some of these interactions could affect the expression of costimulatory molecules involved in host defense against pathogens. This underscores the potential proviral or antiviral roles of these interactions on mosquito-borne viral infections. Our study provides a preliminary enquiry into the vector (mosquito)-host (human) interaction networks and how this interaction could be further investigated and harnessed as a strategy to augment existing vector-borne diseases control approaches.
