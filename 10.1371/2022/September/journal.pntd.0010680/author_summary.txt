Neglected tropical diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and schistosomiasis pose major health threat in poor tropical regions of the world. MDA is the preferred strategy mostly used in the treatment and management of lymphatic filariasis and schistosomiasis. Although MDA has proven effective since its adoption in 2000, however, most if not all post-MDA surveillance have focused on efficacy but not ADEs post-MDA. The present study assessed incidence of ADEs and factors that may contribute to ADE incidence among students treated with PZQT or ADZ monotherapy or combination of the two (PZQT + ADZ) as part of an annual District mass de-worming exercise against lymphatic filariasis and schistosomiasis at KEEA Municipality. Incidence of ADEs post-MDA, although mostly transient and manageable, was quite common among the study population. It is recommended that the Disease Control Unit of the Ghana Health Service should consider reviewing post-MDA surveillance to include ADE monitoring and management.
