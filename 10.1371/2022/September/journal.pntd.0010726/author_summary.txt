Clonorchis sinensis, also known as the liver fluke, lives in human bile duct system and is endemic in East Asia. Chronic C. sinensis infection without treatment can result in serious illness and predispose the human to bile duct cancer. Helminth infection is able to modulate the host immune response and influence the outcome of infection, but the immune characteristics of C. sinensis infection is not yet known. In this study, we analyzed serum samples from individuals living in endemic areas with clonorchiasis in China. We found C. sinensis infection caused increased specific IgG and IgE to adult worm antigens, but diminished levels of key cytokines for essential immune response. Th1 cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12p70, IFN-γ and TNF-α), Th2 cytokine (IL-4), as well as Th17 cytokine (IL-17A) showed decreasing trend by infection intensity. Moreover, females exhibited more significant cytokine variation compared to males with similar infection intensity. Our study indicates that C. sinensis infection is related to immune suppression in human, which might contribute to the outcome of clonorchiasis. The sexual dimorphism needs to be considered in the clonorchiasis prophylaxis and immune investigation.
