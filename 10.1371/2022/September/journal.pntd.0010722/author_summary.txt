Shigella infections are common among children in low-resource settings and cause inflammation, which may contribute to poor child development outcomes. We studied children from birth to 6â€“8 years of age in Brazil, Tanzania, and South Africa to assess whether Shigella infections and markers of inflammation in the first 2 years of life were associated with child development outcomes at school age, including height and cognitive assessment scores. Shigella infections were consistently associated with long-term deficits in linear growth. However, the associations between Shigella and cognitive outcomes were smaller, not statistically significant, and inconsistent across the three sites. There was no evidence that inflammation caused by Shigella explained the associations between Shigella and school-aged outcomes. Systemic inflammation was strongly associated with lower cognitive assessment scores in Brazil but not in the other sites, highlighting the differences in determinants of child development across settings. Quantifying the impact and understanding mechanisms for the effect of early life exposures to Shigella on long-term cognitive outcomes remains challenging.
