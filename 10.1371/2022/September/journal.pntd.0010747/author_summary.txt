Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsioses are important neglected zoonoses throughout the world, with expanding known distribution, among which R. raoultii is an emerging member. As the clinical symptoms of R. raoultii is similar to other diseases, the accurate diagnosis of the pathogen based on the detection of genome plays a vital role in effective treatment and control at low infection levels. Due to the lack of on-site detection technology of Rickettsia raoultii in remote areas, the pathogen can only be treated in the late infection stage with specific clinical symptoms. Closed dumbbell-mediated isothermal amplification (CDA) is a method that rapidly amplifies nucleic acids under isothermal condition, which can help to resolve the problem of point of care detection for R. raoultii. The established R. raoultii detection approach based on CDA was feasible for on-site detection with merits of easy-operation, rapidity, high sensitivity, and specificity. At last, compared with PCR and LAMP, CDA method is simpler and more efficient to detect R. raoultii, which helps to improve the efficiency of detection and strengthen the prevention and control of this neglected but widely distributed disease.
