Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease which affects livestock and humans, causing symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe morbidity and even mortality in Sri Lanka. The bacterium is known to survive well outside the hosts under favourable conditions such as in a rice-ecosystem. In low-income situations the wellbeing of families can suffer significantly if the principal breadwinner is affected or their livestock turns out sick. In this study rodent host species were sampled in and around smallholder rice storage structures in Sri Lanka with the aim of building knowledge on the wildlife reservoir and potential spill-over events. Leptospira were commonly detected in the black rat and in commensal shrew species. Genetic analysis demonstrated that Leptospira isolates found in these small mammal species were similar to those already isolated from human clinical cases from Sri Lanka. In a biodiversity hotspot such as Sri Lanka, this information can be used to design and implement management strategies which focus on particular host species.
