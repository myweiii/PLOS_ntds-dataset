Dengue is one of the fastest-growing vector-borne diseases in the world. Currently, vaccines are experimental and are not very effective, so prevention depends on the control of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Health promotion campaigns aimed at encouraging people to reduce mosquito breeding sites have limited effect. In addition, the heterogeneity of the territories that have dengue becomes a major challenge for the epidemiological surveillance of the disease. Brazil has a territory of continental size, and single standardized surveillance is not very effective for monitoring this arbovirus. Classifying types of dengue dynamics based on features of the epidemiological cycle in each location has the potential to increase the precision of surveillance and control strategies. In our study, we were able to classify areas according to different dengue transmission profiles, ranging from episodic to persistent transmission. These results can provide tools to guide actions aimed at achieving the World Health Organizationâ€™s goals of eliminating neglected tropical diseases in countries that have the virus.
