Chagas disease (CD), a neglected vector-borne disease, negatively impacts 300,000 United States citizens in present time. The parasite that causes CD, Trypanosoma cruzi, is spread through the infected feces of triatomine bugs. Vector-borne transmission risk is considered highest in the southwestern United States, where there is greater triatomine diversity. Southwestern National Park Service (NPS) employees are a unique population regarding human-CD risk because they live in close contact with several species of triatomines. However, CD transmission does not solely result from biological factors; sociocultural factors, including what human populations understand and what they do in response to a disease, are integral for vector-borne agent spread. Therefore, we investigated how NPS employee knowledge and attitudes impact their triatomine preventive behaviors. We detected high self-reported triatomine bug bite exposure in southwestern national parks. Additionally, NPS employees overall had low knowledge of CD, but greater knowledge of CD was not associated with better practices. Human emotions, behavior, and environmental factors are deeply rooted within the CD transmission cycle. This research adds to the growing body of literature on the CD knowledge, attitudes, and practices of a high-risk population in the US.
