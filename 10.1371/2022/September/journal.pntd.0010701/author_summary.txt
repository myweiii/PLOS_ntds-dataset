Surveillance of vector mosquitoes is essential for prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases. However, traditional methods for monitoring mosquitoes may not meet ethical requirements and are labor-intensive. We developed an internet-based vector mosquito monitor, MS-300, that can sensitively detect mosquito entry and automatically transmit the data to cloud-based server services and remote terminals. We evaluated its efficiency for the capture of the important vector mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus, in laboratory, semi-field and field trials. Our results demonstrate that the MS-300 device could monitor Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus with results comparable with human landing catches and BioGents Sentinel traps. The MS-300 monitor can be a dependable tool for assessing Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus population densities and circadian activity patterns in both laboratory and field surveys and can be used to guide prevention and control efforts of mosquito-borne diseases when applied to daily and seasonal population fluctuations.
