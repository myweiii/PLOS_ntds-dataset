Scabies is a known public health problem in the Pacific region. This study aimed to determine the importance of scabies and associated skin infections in the Loyalty Island Province (LIP) of New Caledonia (20,000 inhabitants).
The provincial electronic medical database was searched for all cases of scabies and skin infection that occurred in the LIP population between 2004 and 2018. To evaluate the impact of scabies on skin infections, we measured the decrease in the number of skin infections in children <5 years one year after scabies treatment.
Over the study period, the average number of scabies cases occurring each year was 6 per 100 inhabitants. In children <1 year, this number was 18 per 100 inhabitants. We found that 80% of children aged 15 years had experienced at least one episode of scabies. We also observed a fourfold decrease in the number of skin infections in children <5 years 1 year after treatment. Scabies was more frequent (+30%) in winter.
