    "Background": "Scabies and its complications are a public health problem in the low- and middle-income countries of the Western Pacific region. However, no data are available for the relatively wealthy French territory of New Caledonia. This study aimed to determine the incidence of scabies and its association with skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) in Loyalty Islands Province (LIP) (20,000 inhabitants), New Caledonia.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This retrospective observational study reviewed cases of scabies and SSTI extracted from the electronic health record databases of LIP clinics for the period 2004\u20132018. Data were validated through double sampling. The overall scabies incidence rate (IR) and scabies IRs by sex and age group were calculated. Scabies seasonality was evaluated. For children <5 years, the presence of SSTI was compared between the 3-month period preceding scabies diagnosis/treatment and the 3-month period preceding the 1-year anniversary of scabies diagnosis/treatment (self-matching).",
    "Conclusions": "Although health care is much better in New Caledonia than in neighboring countries, scabies is highly endemic in LIP. The disease is especially common in children <2 years and is associated with many SSTIs in children <5 years. Mass drug administration should be considered."
