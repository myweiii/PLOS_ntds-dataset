Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are a group of parasites that remain a public health challenge across developing countries. The high number of global infections is ongoing despite significant financial investment in reducing the disease burden in endemic countries. In recent years WHO recommendations have shifted morbidity reduction to the possibility of transmission elimination through MDA and WaSH measures. One concern with attempting this route towards transmission interruption remains the impact that compliance and coverage has on effectiveness of community-wide treatment. The problem of STH reinfection means that a sustainable break in transmission remains difficult to achieve across an entire community. Despite repeated rounds of treatment, non-compliant individuals can shed infective eggs into the environment, essentially exposing treated individuals to become re-infected. This study highlights this problem, despite the overall effectiveness in reducing infection intensity across communities in the study area, prevalence remains at levels that would not indicate transmission interruption. This in part is due to the non-compliant individuals remaining viable reservoirs for infection that will lead to reinfection of that community before repeated round of MDA. This study indicates the importance of understanding treatment compliance and tools to combat the problem in settings where transmission interruption is being sought.
