The World Health Organization has presented estimates of the burden of foodborne disease and attribution percentages of zoonotic foodborne pathogens to food groups (e.g., beef, vegetables). To inform food safety decision making at the national level, these estimates should be combined, extended to pathogens with human reservoirs and provided at a more detailed level (e.g., drinking raw milk as one food product in the dairy group). We present a Structured Expert Elicitation study using the same protocol as the World Health Organization (Cooke’s Classical Model) to attribute foodborne disease of selected pathogens (Campylobacter spp., enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Cryptosporidium spp., Brucella spp., Mycobacterium bovis) to different food types and food products in the beef, dairy, poultry and vegetable groups in three African countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Rwanda). Individual experts’ uncertainty assessments resulted in modest statistical accuracy and high information scores, that is concentrated in small ranges, suggesting overconfident assessments. Nevertheless, the optimized item-weighted decision maker was statistically accurate and informative. Cooke’s Classical Model with performance-based weighting provided robust uncertainty estimates of the attribution of foodborne disease in three African countries.
