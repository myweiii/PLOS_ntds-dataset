The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for sustainable and effective water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). There is a significant body of literature measuring the impact of WASH interventions on health outcomes, such as diarrhoea or soil-transmitted helminth infections. The importance of behavioural determinants is also recognized and measured. However, many WASH interventions are not sustainable long-term. To improve this, research focus in the WASH sector has recently shifted towards implementation. This includes a significant number of process evaluations that focus on how well programs are implemented.
A key component of implementation that has been recognized for health interventions in clinical settings is the initial and ongoing ‘acceptability’ to the recipient population. Sekhon et al. developed a theoretical framework of acceptability to capture the aspects of acceptability that may influence intervention uptake and sustained use. This is the first review of acceptability of WASH interventions. The outcomes of this review add new evidence on how and why it has been measured, and the potential place of acceptability evaluations in WASH to improve the impact and sustainability of interventions. The findings of this review may be useful for WASH stakeholders including intervention researchers, implementers, and recipients.
