Accurate diagnostic tests are needed to aid yaws eradication efforts. Diagnostic tests are important for determining where yaws is present and for monitoring eradication efforts. Whilst there are tests available, they have limitations and will not all be suitable in all settings, especially as disease prevalence reduces in the move towards eradication. Therefore, new diagnostics solutions are needed. To aid with this, we determined the programmatic areas of greatest need (use cases) and then developed a shortlist of product requirements (target product profiles, or TPPs) for each scenario. These TPPs can then be used by product developers to ensure that novel diagnostic tools in development are fit for purpose. There were two programmatic use cases for which yaws TPPs were developed. The first TPP focused on diagnostics to detect a single case of yaws in a community, thus highlighting the need for, or continuation of mass drug administration efforts. The second TPP lays out the requirement for a test that can detect resistance to azithromycin, the antibiotic used for the eradication campaigns. This will be key to rapidly detect emergent antibiotic resistant bacteria and prevent it from being passed on.
