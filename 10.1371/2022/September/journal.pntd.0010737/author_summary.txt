Emergomycosis, histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis and blastomycosis are serious fungal diseases which occur in southern Africa among people with either healthy or weakened immune systems. These fungal diseases may be missed because they mimic other diseases, occur together with other conditions that mask their presence or are simply not considered by healthcare workers. There are very few available simple diagnostic tests and most African countries do not conduct fungal disease surveillance. We described cases of these fungal diseases, which had been diagnosed in South African laboratories, from 2010â€“2020. We identified 682 cases, of which 307 were proven, 279 were probable and 96 were possible based on the available clinical and laboratory information. A majority of cases could not be allocated to one of the four disease types and were classified as unspecific endemic mycoses (30.4%). The remainder were sporotrichosis (24.9%), emergomycosis (22.3%), histoplasmosis (19.5%), blastomycosis (2.1%) and a travel-associated infection, talaromycosis (0.6%). We found relatively few cases considering the large population at risk. We believe that this could be due to the above-mentioned issues and insufficient expertise in diagnostic laboratories. There is a need to increase awareness among healthcare workers and to develop rapid point-of-care diagnostic tools and make these widely accessible.
