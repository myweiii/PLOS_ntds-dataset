Molecular diagnosis of human specimens is the fastest way to confirm and subsequently mitigate yellow fever (YF) outbreaks. In Africa, a serological method requiring lengthy confirmation external to the National Laboratories is standard and results are not always definitive due to factors such as cross-reactive antibodies. Molecular testing has been uncommon in African YF laboratories, largely due to challenges with acquiring reagents and a lack of an approved assay that simplifies laboratory procedures. In our capacities as members of the global Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics strategy, we independently evaluated the RealStar Yellow Fever RT-PCR kit 1.0 (altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany). We showed that the assay is sensitive and specific for detection of RNA from representative YF virus strains found worldwide. It is not subject to interference from common blood contaminants and has good clinical performance. In conjunction with a separately conducted review of the manufacturerâ€™s quality systems, we concluded that the RealStar Yellow Fever Virus RT-PCR kit 1.0 is appropriate for use in YF endemic regions. Logistical and funding support to introduce the assay is being arranged, which should decrease YF outbreak detection times and ultimately save lives.
