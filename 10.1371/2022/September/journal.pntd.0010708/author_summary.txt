In this retrospective cohort study laparoscopic hepatectomy for hepatic alveolar echinococcosis had no negative impact on perioperative outcomes, disease recurrence or survival compared with open hepatectomy. The importance of this finding is that the laparoscopic approach is feasible and safe for selected patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis, especially those with PNM stage 1.
