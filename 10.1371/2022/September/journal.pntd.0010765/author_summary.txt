We adapt a compartmental ODE model of lymphatic filariasis (LF) transmission and focus our attention on what happens after Mass Drug Administrations (MDA) is terminated. We add a game-theoretic component to the model and study whether LF transmission can be substantially interrupted by voluntary use of personal protection strategies such as using insect repellents. We identify optimal voluntary protection levels and demonstrate that LF incidence rates will become too high.
