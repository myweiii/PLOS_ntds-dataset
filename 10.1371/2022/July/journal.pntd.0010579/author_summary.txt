Snakebites mostly affect rural communities living in tropical regions. The beliefs and perceptions of these rural inhabitants on snakes and snakebites could inform the development of resources to minimise the risk of injury to humans and snakes. However, few studies have investigated how rural communities perceive snakes and snakebites, and the beliefs that drive these perceptions. We conducted interviews with members of the community in Kitui county, to explore the beliefs and perceptions regarding snakes and snakebites and methods of prevention and management. Negative perceptions were common, and there was a generalised awareness to prevent snakebite by keeping snakes away from homes/compounds. There was a preference for hospital treatment of snakebite, but this was limited by logistic and financial obstacles to early hospital presentation. Most inhabitants used the black stone before seeking health care, and there was an expectation for the snake’s ‘teeth’ to fall out of the wound for complete healing to occur. Our findings highlight a need to explore and clarify common misconceptions about snakes and first aid treatment of snakebites, and to improve community perceptions using locally developed forms of knowledge, and employment of art techniques such as music and dance.
