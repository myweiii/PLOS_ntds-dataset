Almost 90% of people requiring schistosomiasis preventive chemotherapy in 2018 lived in sub-Saharan Africa. Besides, 205.3 million children under five years suffer and die of undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries. The physiopathology of schistosomiasis mansoni involves liver damage, oxidative stress, and perturbation of the immune response. These disturbances are intensified by undernutrition. Praziquantel is used to treat schistosomiasis, but its efficacy on the comorbidity of S. mansoni infection and undernutrition has not been investigated. We conducted this study to assess the effectiveness of praziquantel on S. mansoni infection in mice fed with a low-protein diet. We recorded growth retardation, hepatomegaly, and high worm and egg burdens in mice fed with a low-protein diet and treated with PZQ. Moreover, the treatment did not reverse the liver function injury, oxidative stress, high iron level, and low calcium level. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-5 was still high, and the gene expression of some macrophage-associated chemokines was reduced. Therefore, this study demonstrated that in a murine model of a low-protein diet, the efficacy of praziquantel on S. mansoni infection was reduced. It also underlines the importance of targeting protein deficiency and malnutrition in populations living in schistosomiasis endemic areas for efficient disease control.
