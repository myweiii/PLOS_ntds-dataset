Leishmania infantum, a parasitic protozoan causing fatal visceral leishmaniasis, is transmitted to humans by several sand fly vectors. In this study, the microbiota within the midguts of Phlebotomus kandelakii, P. perfiliewi, P. major and P. alexandri was analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) Miseq sequencing, revealing highly diverse community composition and abundance, from three diverse ecological and geographical regions of Iran. It appears that the gut microbiota is highly dynamic and controlled by multiple factors, including sand fly host and environment. Proteobacteria were the principal bacterial phylum isolated. High numbers of gram-positive human or animal pathogens were also found, suggesting that sand fly vectors of ZVL could pose a potential threat to livestock and human in the region. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between vector capacity and bacterial diversities, where the weakest ZVL vector had the lowest diversity, whereas other, more efficient, vectors had higher diversity. This study showed that Bacillus subtilis, Asaia sp. and Enterobacter cloacae are possible candidates for a paratransgenic approach to reduce Leishmania transmission.
