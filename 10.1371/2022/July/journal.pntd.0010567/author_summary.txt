Taenia solium is a parasitic worm of people and pigs. It is the most significant global foodborne parasite and causes neurocysticercosis, the leading cause of preventable human epilepsy in low and middle-income countries. Due to this significance, many people have attempted to estimate the burden of disease of T. solium. The disability-adjusted life year is the most common method for measuring burden of disease and combines the number of years of life lost with the number of years of life lived with disability due to an illness. This review found that many published studies probably underestimate the true burden of disease due to the challenges in diagnosing neurocysticercosis. If estimates are to become more accurate there must be further research into the epidemiology of T. solium and new approaches to disease modelling. Current estimates can be difficult to compare and a reporting framework for burden of disease studies may increase their utility by facilitating subsequent use and interpretation of different approaches.
