Mathematical and statistical models have been used to forecast the global decline of active trachoma prevalence as a result of interventions against the disease. Here we used trachoma program data to create an empirical model predicting the year of attaining global elimination. We analyzed over 20 years of trachoma implementation and survey data to calculate the mean number of rounds of mass drug administration required for implementation units to fall below the elimination threshold for active trachoma. We then compared these means against the number of rounds of mass drug administration previously undertaken for all areas still above the elimination threshold to produce a forecast of the last year of antibiotic distribution for each implementation unit. Our model predicts that elimination will be achieved in 2028 in Ethiopia (95% CI: 2026–2033) and 2029 outside of Ethiopia (95% CI: 2023–2034), with areas in East Africa predicted to be the last requiring mass drug administration globally. However, although disease-elimination progress can be predicted for most implementation units, there is an important minority of implementation units that is not declining or has not yet begun implementation. These areas represent an important barrier to the timely global elimination of active trachoma.
