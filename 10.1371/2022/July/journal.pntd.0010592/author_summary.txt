Characterising the transmission intensity of dengue virus is essential to inform the implementation of interventions, such as vector control and vaccination, and to better understand the environmental drivers of transmission locally and globally. It is therefore important to understand how methodological differences and model choice may influence the accuracy of estimates of transmission intensity. Using a simulation study, we assessed the performance of catalytic and mixture models to reconstruct the force of infection (FOI) from simulated antibody titre data. Furthermore, we estimated the FOI of dengue virus from antibody titre data collected in Vietnam and Indonesia. The models produced consistent estimates of FOI when they were applied to data with clear separation between the distributions of seronegative and seropositive antibody titres. We observed greater bias in FOI estimates obtained from catalytic models than from mixture models when they were applied to data with high overlap in the bimodal distribution of antibody titres. Our results indicate that mixture models could be preferential to estimate dengue virus FOI when the antibody titre distributions of the seronegative and seropositive components largely overlap.
