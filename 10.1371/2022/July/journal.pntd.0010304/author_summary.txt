Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), transmitted by P. argentipes sand flies, is endemic in South-East Asian countries such as Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, and is on the verge of elimination as a public health problem in Nepal by 2023. As part of the WHO Global Vector Control Response, entomological surveillance including insecticide resistance monitoring is one of the four main pillars of this strategy. In the early 1990s, the historical use of DDT for sand fly vector control was replaced with deltamethrin or alpha-cypermethrin, which have now been in use for almost three decades in Nepal. Suspecting that this long-term use of pyrethroids might have selected resistance in sand fly populations which would jeopardize control efforts, we conducted the first comprehensive survey to generate contemporary evidence of insecticide resistance in Nepal. For this, we performed WHO susceptibility tests in five VL endemic districts and found strong evidence of pyrethroid resistance in vector populations from the areas receiving IRS. Resistance mechanisms involved would probably be kdr mutations and monooxygenase. This study also endorses regular insecticide resistance monitoring to inform evidence-based decisions on insecticide use for vector control and to maintain the effectiveness of vector control measures as a core intervention in the fight against VL.
