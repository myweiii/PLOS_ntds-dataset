We performed a general epidemiological and disease burden assessment of 490 hospitalized children infected with any virus from the family Flaviviridae [Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)] from December 2015 to December 2020 with confirmed clinical presentation and laboratory results. Our study found that hospitalization for Japanese encephalitis (JE) predominated in children who lived in rural areas, and the infection was rate was considerably higher in summer and autumn (July–October) compared with other months. In addition, children hospitalized with JE have the largest share of disease burden. However, the overall low rate of hospitalization and mortality of children shows that China’s JE prevention and control policies remain effective. However, the prevention, control and surveillance of JEV in rural areas should not be neglected. Dengue and yellow fever have not yet caused serious public health concerns among children in China, but the spatial and temporal distributions of viral infection must be assessed to be alert to the indigenous spread of imported cases. CHC is a refractory phenotype of HCV infection in children; thus, early screening and intervention are encouraged given the insidious appearance of symptoms in the early stages after HCV infection. These findings can help to understand the epidemic status of viruses classified in the family Flaviviridae in children and the disease burden of hospitalized children, which is conducive to precise prevention and control, optimization of the allocation of resources, and the formulation of more reasonable and effective policies.
