Morbidity and mortality from vector-borne diseases are an increasing public health problem. Approaches to reduce mosquito abundance to control pathogen transmission, known as population suppression, have been under development in an attempt to decrease the burden imposed by such diseases. One proposed strategy to collapse vector populations relies on skewing the sex ratio equilibrium to compromise fertility. Based on that, this research demonstrates the conditional expression of the male determining factor of the mosquito Ae. aegypti with the goal of establishing repressible sex distortion. Although full conversion of females into males was not achieved, a masculinization phenotype was observed in some transgenic lines, providing the foundation for the development of a new category of genetic vector control strategy via sex ratio distortion.
