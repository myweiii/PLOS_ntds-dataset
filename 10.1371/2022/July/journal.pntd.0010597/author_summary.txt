Rapidly evolving landscape of in-vitro diagnostics is posing quality assurance challenges for manufacturers and regulators as well as creating product selection dilemmas for procurers, donors, and national programmes. In attempting to address such challenges, a landscape analysis of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) diagnostics was conducted to provide insights for all stakeholders to support a future regulatory framework for NTD diagnostics. The inventory of commercially available diagnostics was compiled and analyzed and the global need and size of the market for each type of diagnostic was estimated. The results showed low commercial value and limited regulatory oversight on NTD diagnostics. Despite the insufficient return on commercial investment, reasonable assurance of product safety, performance and quality is required. One of the priorities is to establish a risk assessment mechanism, in particular for NTD diagnostics of lower risk, in order to support national NTD programmes, procurement agencies, donors and other partners with the selection and procurement of the diagnostics needed to achieve the 2021â€“2030 NTD road map targets.
