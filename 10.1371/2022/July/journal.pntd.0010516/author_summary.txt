There is evidence that typhoid fever incidence may vary over time, but there are few longitudinal studies estimating incidence. This is especially true in Sub-Saharan Africa, where recent estimates show wide variation in incidence across different settings, but very limited longitudinal descriptions from those settings. Incidence estimates were generated using facility-based surveillance data from three study periods that was adjusted for health-seeking behavior established through healthcare utilization surveys performed in the catchment area. In addition to coupling facility-based surveillance data with healthcare utilization data, we utilized a Bayesian statistical methodology in order to estimate incidence and characterize uncertainty around the estimates. Our results demonstrate moderate typhoid incidence in 2007–08 and low incidence during 2012–14 and 2016–18, but with overlapping credible intervals across study periods. Our data are consistent with evidence that endemic typhoid may vary substantially over time. Given potential variation, multi-year surveillance may be warranted in locations making decisions about typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction and other control measures.
