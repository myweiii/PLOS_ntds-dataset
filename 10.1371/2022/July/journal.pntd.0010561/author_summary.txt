Strongyloidiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by a parasite which is endemic to parts of Latin America, Asia and Africa. Due to its characteristic life cycle, individuals can carry the infection lifelong with few or no symptoms. With the aim of knowing the prevalence of S. stercoralis at the community level, a population in the rural area of South India was studied using serologic assessments. There was a seroprevalence of S. stercoralis infection in this study of 33%. This suggests a need to revise control programs in order to avoid continued transmission.
