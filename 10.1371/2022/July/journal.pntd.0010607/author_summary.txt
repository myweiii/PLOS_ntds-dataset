World Health Organization (WHO) has included Mycetoma in the neglected tropical diseases. Epidemiological data of mycetoma cases from Pakistan is not available. Although physicians and surgeons frequently see cases of mycetoma in their clinical practice, but poor socioeconomic conditions of patients restrict laboratory diagnosis such as histopathological and microbiological confirmation of disease. This leads to disability, disfigurement and at times limb loss or mortality. Through this study we are documenting the diagnosed cases of mycetoma from specimens submitted to our laboratory. The diagnosis was mainly made by histopathological examination of samples. It is disappointing to note that mycetoma was not included in the differential diagnosis list of clinicians. Probably, that is the reason that very few samples were submitted to the microbiology laboratory for the culture to find out etiologic agents of eumycetoma and actinomycetoma. Overall, this study has highlighted the gaps in the clinical as well as laboratory diagnosis of this disease and case management.
