Mayaro virus is a neglected tropical disease and there is insufficient evidence to define its geographic range. The mosquito Haemagogus janthinomys is a primary vector of Mayaro and its distribution is largely unknown at a sub-country scale. Building compendiums of collection data and creating ecological niche models provides a more precise estimation of vector species potential habitat. Our dataset stands as one of the most expansive existing for collection data of this species combining data published in literature, publicly available data repositories and digitized museum specimen records. Comparing results of niche models with near real time environmental data can give even better predictions of areas where Mayaro virus exposure could occur. The methods and results of this study can be replicated for any disease/vector of interest so long as there is data discoverable through the scientific literature, public repositories, or other civilian and governmental agencies willing to share.
