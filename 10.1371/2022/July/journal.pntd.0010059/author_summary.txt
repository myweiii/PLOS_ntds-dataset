Aedes aegypti is the most efficient vector of human diseases including yellow fever, dengue chikungunya and Zika. West Africa is an emerging hotspot for dengue, as illustrated by Burkina Fasoâ€™s outbreaks in 2016 and 2017. Coincidentally, this study investigated the bionomics and behavior of Ae. aegypti in urban, peri-urban and rural localities of Ouagadougou, from August to October in 2016 and 2017. The results from over 1700 homes showed that Ae. aegypti preferentially fed on humans and rested primarily outdoors. The most common pupal productive habitats were discarded vehicle tires, animal water troughs and large water barrels. Infestation rates were higher in the urban and peri-urban localities. A range of community-based control measures are suitable for consideration in a vector control program to prevent outbreaks.
This study provides the most complete contemporary description of an Ae. aegypti population in West Africa, providing evidence for mosquito control programs to prevent or mitigate disease outbreaks. The potential of a regional vector control program for west Africa is discussed briefly.
