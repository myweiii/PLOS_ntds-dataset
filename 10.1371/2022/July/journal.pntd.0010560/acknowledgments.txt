We would like to thank the directors of the control programs, as well as their collaborators, for having made some reports available and for detailed explanation of the results observed over the years. For the search of very old publications, we thank the staff of the documentation center of the Institut de Recherche pour le DÃ©veloppement (IRD, French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development in Montpellier).
