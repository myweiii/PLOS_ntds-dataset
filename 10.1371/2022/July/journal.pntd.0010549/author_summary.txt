Arboviral vector Aedes aegypti usually thrives in urban areas due to its close dependence of human dwellings on breeding sites and meals. However, urban landscapes are heterogeneous and present varying levels of urbanization and land use, affecting Ae. aegypti spatial structure and dispersal. We used nuclear Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms to analyze 99 Ae. aegypti specimens from three areas within the city of Buenos Aires: highly urbanized Area 1, intermediate urbanized Area 2 and poorly urbanized Area 3. We found an inverse association between urbanization levels and spatial genetic structure: mosquitoes from Area 1 did not present genetic structure. On the other hand, mosquitoes from Area 2 and 3 displayed 2 and 3 clusters, respectively. Human-mediated transport plays an important role in highly urbanized areas, connecting mosquito populations from distant locations. Potential active dispersal was detected in Area 1 where we found pairs of full-siblings located 1500m apart. In less urbanized areas, the distribution of breeding sites also affected spatial genetic structure. In Area 3, spatial structure was mostly due to consanguinity, but it also reflected the effect of urban landscape on Ae. aegypti population dynamics. Area 2 presented the highest effective population size. This could be partially explained by the advantageous conditions that cemeteries offer to vector populations which can also spill over surrounding neighbourhoods. Our results suggest that vector programs should consider the heterogeneity of urban landscapes to improve the effectiveness of control measures.
