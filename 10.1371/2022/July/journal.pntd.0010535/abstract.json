    "Abstract": "A recurring question concerning Trypanosoma cruzi DNA detection/quantification is related to the fact that DNA amplification, by itself, does not differentiate between viable or dead parasites. On the other hand, RNA can be considered a potential molecular marker of pathogens viability. Herein, we developed a quantitative real-time PCR with reverse Transcription (RT-qPCR) to quantify viable T. cruzi in artificially infected Rhodnius prolixus whilst evaluating differences between DNA and mRNA quantification along the insect midgut during 5, 9, 15 and 29 days after feeding. The RT-qPCR presented an improved performance with linearities ranging from 107 to 102 parasites equivalents and 3 to 0.0032 intestine unit equivalents, and efficiencies of 100.3% and 102.8% for both T. cruzi and triatomine targets, respectively. Comparing both RT-qPCR and qPCR, we confirmed that RNA is faster degraded, no longer being detected at day 1 after parasite lysis, while DNA detection was stable, with no decrease in parasite load over the days, even after parasite lysis. We also observed statistical differences between the quantification of the parasite load by DNA and by RNA on day 15 after feeding of experimentally infected R. prolixus. When assessing different portions of the digestive tract, by RT-qPCR, we could detect a statistically significant reduction in the parasite amount in the anterior midgut. Oppositely, there was a statistically significant increase of the parasite load in the hindgut. In conclusion, for this study parasite\u2019s viability in R. prolixus digestive tract were assessed targeting T. cruzi mRNA. In addition, differences between DNA and RNA detection observed herein, raise the possibility that RNA is a potential molecular viability marker, which could contribute to understanding the dynamics of the parasite infection in invertebrate hosts."
