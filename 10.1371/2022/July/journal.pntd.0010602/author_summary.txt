Although generally mild and self-limiting, infections with Dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) can progress to severe complications requiring hospitalization and/or cause death. It has also been hypothesized that arbovirus infections may indirectly lead to hospitalizations or death by decompensating pre-existing comorbidities. We investigated whether increases in notifications of confirmed arbovirus cases in Brazil between 2014 and 2019 were associated with excess hospitalizations from any cause, from arboviruses, or from specific indirect causes (e.g., diabetes). Our findings indicate widespread and seasonal circulation of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV in Brazil. In municipalities with at least 200 notifications of a given arbovirus during the study period, increased incidence of confirmed dengue, and chikungunya cases were all associated with small increases in hospitalizations directly caused by arboviruses but were not consistently associated with excess all-cause or indirectly caused hospitalizations. Increases in Zika was associated to increases in hospitalizations by neurological diseases. Nevertheless, this study is limited by the ecological design, and follow-up studies are needed to investigate if arboviruses infections can, at the individual-level, exacerbate pre-existing comorbidities and lead to hospitalizations by indirect causes.
