The recent road map (2021â€“2030) released by WHO for controlling or eliminating neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) highlights diagnostics as a major focus. Development and deployment of accurate, affordable and field-friendly diagnostics/surveillance tools will be crucial for the control and elimination of schistosomiasis. Multi-epitope chimeric antigens, constructed based on linear B-cell epitopes identified from highly antigenic antigens, may achieve not only an equivalent or superior diagnostic performance compared to the parent immunogens but also exhibit more optimal physicochemical properties. However, to date, only a limited number of linear B-cell epitopes have been identified for the serological diagnosis of schistosomiasis. In this study, we identified a linear B-cell epitope (-S163QCSLVGDIFVDKYLD178-) on SjSAP4, a recognized immunodiagnostic biomarker for schistosomiasis japonica, and validated its potential as a component of a multi-epitope assay for the serological diagnosis of schistosomiasis japonica. Notably, differential recognition of B-cell epitopes (SjSAP4-Peptide and SjSP-13V2-Peptide) was observed in a subset of subjects positive by the Kato-Katz technique for the disease. A dual epitope-ELISA (SjSAP4-Peptide + SjSP-13V2-Peptide-ELISA) showed a superior diagnostic performance (84.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity) than individual-epitope ELISAs. The findings in this study provide support for the development of multi-epitope antigen-based diagnostics for schistosomiasis.
