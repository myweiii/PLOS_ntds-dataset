Trachoma is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, transmitted through person-to-person contact, and it is the worldâ€™s leading infectious cause of blindness. Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) is a group of intestinal parasites composed of Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworms), Trichuris trichiura (whipworms), and Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator Americanus (hookworms), that are transmitted by fecal contamination of the soil and adversely affect nutritional status and impair cognitive processes in children. Although there is evidence of the occurrence of trachoma in several areas of Peru, an epidemiological study has not been carried out to determine if it is a public health problem. STH infections have been reported to affect children in areas of the Loreto Department in Peru, but prevalence surveys in rural communities bordering Brazil and Colombia have not been carried out. In this study, we present the results of an integrated survey for trachoma and STH in Loreto and the factors associated with the occurrence of these diseases. The results of this study show that both diseases and risk factors overlap, supporting the need to implement integrated interventions to eliminate them as public health problems in communities living in vulnerable conditions in the Amazon basin of Peru.
