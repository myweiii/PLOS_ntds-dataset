Mosquito-borne disease is an important cause of illness and death in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico. Most tactics to prevent these diseases rely on stopping mosquito bites, either by reducing the mosquito population or creating barriers between mosquitos and humans. These methods vary in the degree of community involvement required. This study used data collected from 2,353 households in Ponce, Puerto Rico from May 2018 to May 2019 to understand how household perception of risk of contracting these diseases related to 1) the amount of money households spent annually to prevent mosquito bites, and 2) the number of activities their household engaged in to prevent mosquito bites. We found that 27% of households perceived themselves at high risk of contracting these diseases, and 36% of households engaged in at least three activities to reduce their risk. On average, households that perceived themselves at high risk spent more money on mosquito bite prevention and engaged in more activities to prevent mosquito bites, compared to households that perceived no risk. Paired with other research in this area, these results support investment in community-based approaches to mosquito control and ensuring that communities have accessible information to understand their risk of mosquito-borne disease.
