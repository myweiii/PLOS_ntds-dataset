Zika virus (ZIKV) spread since 2015 led to establishment of urban epidemic cycles involving humans and Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV is also sexually and vertically transmitted and causes congenital Zika syndrome. Together, these features show that ZIKV poses significant global public health risks. By virtue of similar reproductive anatomy and physiology to humans, macaques serve as a useful model for ZIKV infection. However, macaque studies to date have been limited by small sample size, typically 1 to 5 animals. Although mounting evidence identifies the male reproductive tract as a significant ZIKV reservoir, data regarding the duration of ZIKV persistence, potential for sexual transmission, and male genitourinary sequelae remain sparse. Here, we analyzed archived genital tissues from more than 50 ZIKV-inoculated male macaques. Our results show that ZIKV can persist in the male macaque reproductive tract after the resolution of viremia, with virus localization to sperm precursors and epithelial cells, and microscopic evidence of inflammation in the epididymis and prostate gland. Our findings help explain cases of sexual transmission of ZIKV in humans, which also carries a risk for transmission via assisted fertility procedures, even after resolution of detectable viremia.
