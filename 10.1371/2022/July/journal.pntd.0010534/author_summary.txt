Chagas disease is a complex zoonotic infection caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. This pathology is endemic in the Americas and causes a tremendous burden in terms of public health. The feces of triatomine bugs mainly transmit this parasite. A massive diversity of triatomines can be found in the north of South America, where Rhodnius is considered the most epidemiologically relevant genus. However, government efforts have attempted to control the vector transmission of specific regions. That is the case of Boyaca in eastern Colombia, which has several municipalities certified as free of R. prolixus transmission of the parasite. However, other species such as Triatoma dimidiata can occupy the left niche due to R. prolixus elimination. We explored the infection rate, parasite load, feeding preferences, and T. cruzi diversity in T. dimidiata specimens collected in municipalities with no R. prolixus infestation. Our results highlight the preponderant need for increasing serological surveillance and prevention in those communities due to the risk of a plausible reactivation of T. cruzi vector transmission due to T. dimidiata.
