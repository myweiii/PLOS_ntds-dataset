Areas with unknown onchocerciasis endemicity may pose a threat to eliminating transmission because they may re-introduce onchocerciasis to areas where interventions have been successful. Additionally, because vectors (and thus Onchocerca volvulus transmission) have specific ecological requirements for growth and development, changes in these ecological factors due to human activities (deforestation, modification of river flows by dam construction, climate change) might change patterns of parasite transmission and endemicity. To estimate the impact of environmental changes, we must first identify ecological factors determining prevalence. We have employed Bayesian geostatistical modeling to create a nationwide O. volvulus nodule prevalence map for Ethiopia based on pre-intervention nodule prevalence data and have explored the effect of environmental variables on nodule prevalence. We estimated the number of pre-intervention cases of nodules and associated uncertainty in previously unmapped areas of Ethiopia to identify areas that need additional data to increase the prediction accuracy. Hydrological variables such as distance to the nearest river, precipitation seasonality, soil moisture, and flow accumulation are associated significantly with O. volvulus nodule prevalence. We show that the spatial distribution of nodule prevalence can be estimated based on ecological data and that predicted prevalence can be used as a guide to prioritize pre-intervention mapping.
