Nodding syndrome (NS) is a neglected and progressive neurological disorder that is disabling and of unknown cause. The Greater Mundri area in South Sudan is currently considered to be the epicenter of new cases. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence, spatial pattern and epidemiological risks of NS. We found that the prevalence of NS is very high–more than one in five households affected–in the Greater Mundri area, which is comparable with the previously reported rates within smaller populations in the same area, but higher than the rates reported in all the other NS-endemic countries. We found that NS cases significantly cluster between adjacent households but we could not find clustering within the same household. In addition, we prove that living near the rivers, as well as using river water for drinking, cooking, handwashing and bathing strongly increased the risk of having a NS case in households. We further identified a new association of NS with ownership of poultry.
