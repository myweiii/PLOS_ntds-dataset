Schistosomiasis is a snail-borne neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. Human urogenital schistosomiasis is targeted for elimination on the Zanzibar Archipelago, United Republic of Tanzania, with multiple interventions being implemented to curtail transmission of the parasite to humans on the islands since 2012. Environmental surveillance for schistosomiasis transmission by collecting intermediate host snails, checking snails for Schistosoma infection, and preserving collected snails and Schistosoma parasites offers the possibility for molecular analyses to investigate the evolutionary/genetic relationships of both snails and parasites. Schistosome transmission on Zanzibar was believed to involve a single schistosome species (Schistosoma haematobium) transmitted via a single intermediate host species (Bulinus globosus). However, our findings demonstrate the locally established presence of S. bovis, responsible for bovine intestinal schistosomiasis, and an extended intermediate host compatibility of S. haematobium with the snail B. nasutus on Pemba. Increased parasite diversity and intermediate host species compatibility may increase the transmission of Schistosoma species on Zanzibar and stretch resources for public health interventions with the need for Schistosoma species specific surveillance.
