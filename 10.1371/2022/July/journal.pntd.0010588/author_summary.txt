Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted by mosquitoes and is a serious health threat due to potential epidemic spread. Infection in adults may lead to Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, a neurological disorder, or may cause harm to a developing fetus resulting in preterm birth, fetal death, or devastating congenital malformations. There are currently no approved vaccines against ZIKV. We previously developed a lead candidate vaccine based on a virus-like particle (VLP) that was generated in tissue culture. This ZIKV shell is devoid of any viral genetic material. In previous studies, this lead VLP candidate generated neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that recognized wild-type ZIKV and prevented viral replication in both mice and non-human primates. To increase production of the lead VLP candidate and decrease cost-of-goods, we introduced a single amino acid change, phenylalanine to alanine, in the envelope glycoprotein. This change resulted in a modest increase in VLP yield. However, this single amino acid change resulted in reduced induction of nAbs following immunization and no significant reduction of RNAemia following challenge compared to the lead candidate. The results of this study suggest this investigational vaccine candidate is not suitable for further vaccine development and that ZIKV VLP maturation may have an important role in protection.
