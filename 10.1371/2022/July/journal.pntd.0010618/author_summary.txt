Echinococcosis is a serious but neglected helminthic zoonosis caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis. At present, clinical pharmacotherapy of echinococcosis, such as albendazole (ABZ) and mebendazole, has limited effectiveness. Thus, the development of novel therapeutic drugs for human echinococcosis is urgently needed. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is a glucose analog used as a promising anticancer agent, and it exerts its effects by inhibiting the glycolytic energy metabolism to deplete cells of energy. Echinococcus in the host depends on glycolysis for energy production and glycolysis intermediates for other metabolic processes. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the efficacy of 2-DG against Echinococcus. 2-DG exerted an effective in vitro and in vivo activity against E. granulosus protoscoleces and E. multilocularis metacestodes, and the combination of this drug with ABZ further improved the therapeutic effect. Therefore, 2-DG can be developed as a promising anti-Echinococcus drug, and its combination with ABZ may provide a new strategy for the treatment of human echinococcosis in the future.
