Taenia solium cysticercosis (TSC) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the larval stage of T. solium. The disease is a serious threat to public health, especially in low-income countries and is associated with poor pig husbandry practices, deficient hygiene and sanitation, close contact between humans and pigs, lack of slaughter facilities for pigs and inadequate meat inspection. When the larva of T. solium lodges in the human central nervous system, the disease is called neurocysticercosis (NCC). The most frequent neurological manifestations of NCC are epileptic seizures and epilepsy. NCC diagnosis remains a challenge in low-income countries and its relationship with neurological signs/symptoms so far was not studied in Mocuba, located in Zamb√©zia province, one of the districts with the biggest pig populations in Mozambique. In this study we investigated the seroprevalence for TSC, risk factors for infection and the association with neuropsychiatric (= neurological and psychiatric) disorders. Seroprevalence of TSC was 10.3%, and was associated with chronic headache. Moreover, increasing age was associated with Ag-ELISA seropositivity. Future studies are needed applying in-depth clinical examination, and additional serological, molecular biological and radiological diagnostic tools in order to confirm (or not) the results of our study.
