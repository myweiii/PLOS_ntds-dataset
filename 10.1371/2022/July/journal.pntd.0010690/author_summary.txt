Cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic infection causing diarrhea and dehydration, emerged as a global enteric pathogen in the 1980s with the AIDS pandemic. Cryptosporidium infections have evolved to become a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in children under the age of 2 years in low to middle income countries. Given these developments, there is a critical need for an effective human vaccine. C. hominis and C. parvum are two Cryptosporidium species, with C. hominis being more common and more infectious than C. parvum. In this study, passive protection conferred to piglets suckling sows immunized with C. parvum during pregnancy was examined. Newborn piglets were separated into 4 groups: 2 groups from sows immunized with C. parvum and 2 control groups from unimmunized sows. One immunized group and one control group were infected with C. parvum, and the second immunized group and the second control group were infected with C. hominis. Newborn piglets were equally and fully protected against diarrheal disease regardless of whether the sow off which they fed was immunized. The results confirm that the damâ€™s colostrum and milk convey non-specific disease-preventing elements for full protection from disease, while passively acquired specific antibody reduces considerably the extent of infection.
