Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness in the world, which is caused by repeated eye infections with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. The global objective of trachoma control is to eliminate trachoma as a blinding disease worldwide by Year 2020, using the World Health Organization-endorsed SAFE strategy (Surgery to correct trichiasis, Antibiotics to treat infection, Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement to interrupt transmission). In order to implement the control program, the knowledge of the disease distribution and prevalence in each district is essential. Disease mapping surveys were conducted in 27 health districts in the Far North region in Cameroon. Thirteen health districts have a prevalence of trachomatous inflammation–follicular ≥10% in children aged 1–9 years and qualify for district-level mass antibiotic treatment as well as intensive implementation of other components of SAFE. There are estimated to be 17193 trichiasis cases in the region, which need surgical operations to prevent from being blinded. The survey provided a foundation for the national program to plan and implement the SAFE strategy in the region.
