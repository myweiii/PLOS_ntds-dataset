Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) is a very common human gastrointestinal parasitic disease which affects 50 million people worldwide. Men who have sex with men (MSM) have already been found to be one of the high-risk populations with E. histolytica infection. Previous studies have reported an increased risk for E. histolytica infection and invasive amebiasis in HIV seropositive MSM. This pilot study aimed to investigate the serology of E. histolytica among MSM from mainland China. High prevalence of E. histolytica infection (41.1%, 246/599) was observed among the study population, receptive anal sex behavior and sadomasochistic behavior were found to be associated with the E. histolytica serostatus. Although HIV infection was not found to be associated with E. histolytica infection in this pilot study, studies from other countries had reported increased risks for E. histolytica infection and invasive amebiasis among HIV-positive MSM. Our findings suggest E. histolytica infection control needs to be concerned with respect to the increasing HIV prevalence among Chinese MSM population.
