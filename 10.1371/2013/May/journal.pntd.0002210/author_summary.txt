Infections caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus have increased significantly over the last two decades, with cases now regularly reported globally. The emergence of cholera at global scale has brought the attention toward other Vibrio diseases in developing countries. This was the situation in Peru, where the investigation of V. cholerae in hospitals and regional public health laboratories after the dramatic emergence of cholera epidemic in 1991 enabled the identification of other pathogenic Vibrio throughout the whole country. The submission of all these bacteria to the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS, Lima, Peru) for characterization generated an extraordinary repository of records and isolates which have been decisive for sizing the impact of V. parahaemolyticus infections on the population. The present study addresses, for first time, the impact of the arrival of a non-endemic population of V. parahaemolyticus on the genetic structure and virulence attributes of local populations. The detection of the pandemic clone of V. parahaemolyticus to Peru in 1997 changed not only the epidemic dynamics of this pathogen, but also the population structure and genetic variation of native populations through population admixture, horizontal genetic transfer and homologous recombination between native and introduced populations of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus.
