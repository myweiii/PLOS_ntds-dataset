Approximately 680 million people risk infection with food-borne trematodes, including Opisthorchis viverrini (OV). Animal models show that significant kidney pathology results from OV infection as detected by antibodies in urine (microproteinuria). However, kidney pathology in humans infected with OV is often overlooked because it develops alongside more severe pathologies such as bile duct fibrosis and bile duct cancer. In Northeastern Thailand, the researchers observed that OV infected individuals had elevated levels of urine IgG against OV antigen that was not associated with the level of OV infection. The researchers observed that urine IgG to OV antigen was associated with bile duct fibrosis and bile duct cancer. Moreover, individuals with urine IgG to OV antigen also had elevated risk of bile duct fibrosis and bile duct cancer than individuals with no urine IgG to OV antigen. For the first time, OV infection has been shown to result in significant kidney disease in humans, which is also strongly associated with bile duct pathology. A urine-based assay that could indicate both renal and bile duct pathology from OV infection would be of profound benefit in Southeast Asia, especially in the resource-limited settings of the Mekong Basin region countries of Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.
