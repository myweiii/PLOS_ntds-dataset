Serological investigations indicate that Q fever is present nationwide in China. However, this zoonosis is poorly understood, and nearly all cases of Q fever are retrospectively diagnosed because of the lack of laboratory diagnosis techniques. Traditional serodiagnosis requires a pair of serum samples from the acute and convalescent stages of infection, which is not useful as an early test of C. burnetii. In this study, we developed a rapid, simple and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that targets the htpAB gene of C. burnetii, in which the lowest limits of the LAMP assay were 1 copy per reaction and the specificity of the LAMP assay was 100%. The sensitivity of the LAMP was significantly higher than that of the real time PCR on evaluation of its utility of detection clinical Q fever patients samples and domestic animals samples. Using the developed LAMP assay, Q fever was first confirmed in the Yi Li area, Xinjiang Province, and the positive rate was 33.3% for unknown febrile patients and 21.0% for domestic animals. Here we concluded that the developed LAMP assay is ideal for the early diagnosis of Q fever, especially in rural areas in China.
