Leishmania mexicana is a single-celled parasite that causes chronic skin disease in humans and mice. Antibodies on the surface of parasites lead to the production of a protein called interleukin-10 (IL-10), which blocks an effective immune response needed to kill parasites and resolve skin lesions. In mice, IL-10 is required to maintain chronic, non-healing lesions. Parasite surface targets of these antibodies have not been identified. Using biochemical and immunologic techniques, we have shown that antibodies bind to parasite surface glycolipids (molecules with sugars that are anchored to the membrane by lipids), rather than to protein targets. We have determined some basic structural features of these glycolipids and shown that antibodies to them bind the surface of parasites and can induce IL-10 from mouse cells. We have extended this work to humans by showing that people infected with this parasite also make antibodies that bind to these glycolipids and to the surface of parasites, and that can induce IL-10 from human white blood cells. Further characterization of these glycolipids may have important implications for the development of a drug or vaccine for this and related parasite infections, and may shed light on poorly understood immunologic pathways by which glycolipids induce antibody responses.
