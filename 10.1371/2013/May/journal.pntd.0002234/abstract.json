    "Background": "Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging around the world due to a higher prevalence of immunosuppressive illness and therapy. Saudi Arabia is not an exception as there have been novel mycobacterial species also identified. In addition, several published case reports from different parts of the country suggest a growing pathogenic potential of NTM. As the first nationwide study, we sought to gain an insight into the species diversity of NTM clinical isolates.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "During June 2009\u2013July 2010, 95 clinical isolates were collected from tuberculosis reference laboratories in major provinces within Saudi Arabia and subjected to standard line probe assay techniques to identify their species. Diagnostic guidelines of the American Thoracic Society were applied to determine the clinical relevance of respiratory isolates.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "The high rates of clinically confirmed respiratory cases suggest that NTM infections are indeed a new challenge to health authorities. The current findings show an opposite picture of the Western world where M. avium complex and particularly slow growing NTM are the most predominant respiratory pathogens. The complexity of species demands an immediate strengthening of the current diagnostic facilities."
