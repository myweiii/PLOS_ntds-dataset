Transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes found worldwide, dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. The incidence of dengue has increased 30-fold over the past 50 years, and is now endemic in over 100 countries. Vaccination is believed to be one of the most effective strategies in dengue prevention. However, no vaccine is currently available, and prevention strategies to control mosquitoes in endemic areas have been insufficient in controlling dengue. We have developed a recombinant live-attenuated tetravalent vaccine against all four serotypes of dengue virus. This candidate vaccine is currently under human clinical evaluation. In this report, we provide information regarding our manufacturing strategy, and present details of the genetic and biological characterization of the master seed virus for each vaccine serotype. The study described here, our previously reported and ongoing pre-clinical studies, and current clinical trials will provide critical information to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine to protect humans against dengue.
