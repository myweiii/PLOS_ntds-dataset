Accidents involving brown spiders (Loxosceles genus) are reported throughout the world. South and Southeast of Brazil are endemic areas for this spider. Loxosceles bites commonly trigger local signs as swelling, erythema, hemorrhage and the hallmark symptom: a dermonecrotic lesion with gravitational spreading. Systemic effects are less common; however, are implicated in more severe cases. Hyaluronidases are referred in several venoms as “spreading factors” due to their enzymatic activity upon extracellular components. This activity facilitates the permeation of other toxins through the victim's body. In fact, a previous study identified the activity of L. intermedia venom upon glycosaminoglycans which are abundant components in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. Disclosing a little more about the role of hyaluronidases within this venom, we investigated the activities of a recombinant hyaluronidase from L. intermedia venom. Dietrich's hyaluronidase, as it was designated, was produced as a recombinant protein. By performing a rabbit skin dermonecrosis assay using Dietrich's Hyaluronidase and a dermonecrotic toxin, we showed that Dietrich's Hyaluronidase increased the dermonecrotic area induced by the dermonecrotic toxin. Our results confirm that hyaluronidases are a “spreading factor” of L. intermedia venom.
