Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that causes approximately 20 to 40 thousand deaths every year. In Brazil, more than 600,000 clinical cases of leishmaniasis have been reported since 1990. Almost 90% of these cases are due to cutaneous leishmaniasis, whereas the remaining 10% are due to visceral leishmaniasis. Understanding of disease transmission, together with model-based incidence maps, will assist in designing and optimizing control efforts. We used reported leishmaniasis incidence data in Brazil covering the period between 2001 and 2010 to explore the association of the disease with climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic variables, and to predict its spatial distribution using Bayesian geostatistical models. We produced countrywide high spatial resolution maps for both forms of leishmaniasis and estimated the number of infected people, stratified by state. We believe that our incidence maps are useful to prioritize the spatial targeting of prevention and control.
