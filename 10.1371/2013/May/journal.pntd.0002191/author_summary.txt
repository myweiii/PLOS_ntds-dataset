Buruli ulcer (BU) can lead to large ulcerative lesions due to extensive skin loss caused by the necrotizing effect of the main virulence factor mycolactone. For a long time the general perception was that BU lesions are not infected by other bacteria because of a postulated antimicrobial effect of the macrolide toxin, mycolactone. In this study, we analyzed laboratory confirmed BU lesions before, during, and after streptomycin/rifampicin treatment. Contrary to popular belief, our findings show that BU lesions are frequently co-colonized with other potential bacterial pathogens before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. For example, 75% of cases that were clinically indicative of being infected after treatment were microbiologically confirmed as infected. Most microbiologically infected cases were also confirmed by histopathological analysis. The most prominent bacterial species isolated included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and P. mirabilis. When we tested the isolates against first line drugs used in Ghana, the isolates were found to be resistant to most of these drugs. This study indicates that wound care practices need to be improved and that wound infection may be a common cause of wound healing delay in BU.
