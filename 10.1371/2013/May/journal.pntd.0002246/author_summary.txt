Bartonella species are zoonotic vector-borne bacteria that typically parasitize the erythrocytes of mammalian hosts, resulting in long lasting infections. They are responsible for a wide range of clinical manifestations in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts.
Rodents and a wide range of small mammals serve as reservoirs of bartonellae, usually with no apparent clinical manifestations. Close association between rodents and humans especially in rural communities as well as in the overcrowded cities facilitates transmission of these bacteria.
There have been no studies investigating the presence of Bartonella spp. in rodents and ectoparasites from Nigeria. The aim of the current study was to investigate the presence of Bartonella spp. in commensal rodents and their ectoparasites in Nigeria and its public health implications. We report, for the first time, the molecular detection of Bartonella in 26% (46/177) of commensal rodents and 28% (9/32) of ectoparasite pools from Nigeria. Sequence analysis of the citrate synthase gene (gltA) revealed diversity of Bartonella spp. and genotypes in Nigerian commensal rodents and their ectoparasites. The Bartonella spp. detected in this study were identical or closely related to Bartonella elizabethae, Bartonella tribocorum and Bartonella grahamii previously associated with human diseases highlighting their importance to public health.
