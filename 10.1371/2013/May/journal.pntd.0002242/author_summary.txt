Sand fly saliva contains potent, biologically active proteins that allow the insect to stop host responses to acquire a blood meal. After repeated exposures, a number of these salivary proteins also induce a response in the host such as antibody production and/or cellular-mediated immunity. In animal models, these immune responses affect Leishmania infection. On one hand, immunity to Phlebotomus papatasi saliva protected animals against cutaneous leishmaniasis, while on the other hand, immunity to Lutzomyia intermedia saliva did not protect but exacerbated this disease. These differences are probably due to the types of proteins present in the saliva of these different sand fly species. The present work focused on isolation and identification of the secreted proteins present in the salivary glands of Lu. intermedia, an important vector of L. braziliensis, the agent of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Saliva from this sand fly contains a number of proteins not present in P. papatasi saliva and, with some exceptions; proteins that are homologous between the two species are very divergent. Furthermore, we identified one protein that, after vaccination, induced a cellular immune response able to protect mice against Leishmania braziliensis infection. This is the first evidence that a single salivary protein from Lu. intermedia can protect mice against this cutaneous leishmaniasis.
