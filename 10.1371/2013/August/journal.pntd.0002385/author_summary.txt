Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infectious disease, is a major health problem worldwide. Its incidence has dramatically increased in the last 3 decades, particularly in the Americas. The traditional World Health Organization dengue case definition was in use for over 30 years, but in 2009 a revised dengue case definition, containing fewer symptoms and more signs, was published. In this study, we evaluate the diagnostic utility of both case definitions in children in Managua, Nicaragua. We used clinical data from suspected dengue cases enrolled at two different sites: a health center and the national pediatric reference hospital. Laboratory tests were performed to determine dengue virus infection status. At both sites, the case definitions showed high sensitivity (≥85%) and low specificity (8–55%). In children under 4 years old, who cannot express some of the symptoms included in the definitions, both case definitions showed reduced sensitivity and increased specificity. This reduction was particularly important in the health center, where sensitivity dropped below 50%. In conclusion, both case definitions should be primarily used for screening and not for diagnosis, and caution must be exercised when applying the definitions to younger children. This is the first published evaluation of the revised dengue case definition in pediatric populations.
