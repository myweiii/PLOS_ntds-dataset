Despite significant gains in the reduction of the burden of Chagas disease in many South American countries, active transmission and significant burden remain in areas such as the Gran Chaco. High initial vector density, poor housing material, peridomestic infestation, insecticide resistance, and a lack of systematic insecticide spraying and vector surveillance have previously been incriminated for failure to interrupt and sustain interruption of transmission. We conducted a census, seroprevalence, and epidemiologic study in a rural area in the Bolivian Chaco. The prevalence of infection was almost 20% in children and over 80% in adults. We estimated the intensity of transmission over time based on infection prevalence by age. We found that after the first spray program, transmission appeared to fall transiently but then increased again quickly. Sleeping in a structure with cracks in the walls, age and village of residence were associated with increased likelihood of infection. These findings suggest that consistently repeated systematic spraying campaigns accompanied by housing improvements are necessary to interrupt and sustain interruption of vector-borne transmission.
