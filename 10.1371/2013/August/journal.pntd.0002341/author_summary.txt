Scrub typhus has been recognized as a public health problem in the rural areas of Southeast Asia. The aboriginal population, one of the most impoverished groups in the Malaysia, may be exposed to the bite of Leptotrombidium mites (vector for scrub typhus) due to their involvement in the agricultural activities, living environment and personal habits. A serosurvey was conducted for seven aboriginal subgroups to determine antibody prevalence to O. tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus and to identify factors associated with scrub typhus. The findings in this study confirmed high antibody prevalence to O. tsutsugamushi in aboriginal subgroups who engaged in agricultural activity. Multivariate analysis showed that individuals who are above 18 years old, receiving household income less than US$ 166.7 (RM500) per month and having close contact with animal pets have higher exposure rates to scrub typhus. Institution of appropriate preventive measures is important in reducing the risk of acquiring scrub typhus in the population studied.
