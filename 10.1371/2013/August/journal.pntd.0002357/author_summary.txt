The four serotypes of the mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV) infect an estimated 100 million humans annually, resulting in tens of millions of dengue cases and hundreds of thousands of cases of severe disease. However, infection with DENV does not always lead to clinical signs, and a large proportion of DENV infections are inapparent. Here, we studied the factors that influence whether a DENV infection is inapparent or symptomatic. Data from over 2,000 DENV infections (∼1,600 inapparent and ∼400 symptomatic) were collected during 7 years from an ongoing prospective cohort study of children in Managua, Nicaragua. We show that whether a person is infected for the first, the second, or the third time with different DENV serotypes, the proportion of symptomatic infections is similar. However, the proportion of symptomatic infection varied substantially across study years, and symptomatic infections tended to happen in older children when compared to inapparent infections. We also show that if a second DENV infection happens within a period of ∼2 years after the first infection, the second infection is more likely to be inapparent. However, if the time interval between first and second DENV infections is longer, this protection wanes and the infection is likely to be symptomatic. These findings are important for the modeling of dengue epidemics and the development of new vaccines.
