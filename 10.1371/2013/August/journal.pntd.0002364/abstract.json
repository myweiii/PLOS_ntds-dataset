    "Background": "We investigated the pathological and diagnostic role of selected markers of inflammation, oxidant/antioxidant status, and cellular injury in human Chagas disease.",
    "Methods": "Seropositive/chagasic subjects characterized as clinically-symptomatic or clinically-asymptomatic (n\u200a=\u200a116), seronegative/cardiac subjects (n\u200a=\u200a102), and seronegative/healthy subjects (n\u200a=\u200a45) were analyzed for peripheral blood biomarkers.",
    "Results": "Seropositive/chagasic subjects exhibited an increase in sera or plasma levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO, 2.8-fold), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP, 56%), nitrite (5.7-fold), lipid peroxides (LPO, 12\u201317-fold) and malondialdehyde (MDA, 4\u20136-fold); and a decline in superoxide dismutase (SOD, 52%) and glutathione (GSH, 75%) contents. Correlation analysis identified a significant (p<0.001) linear relationship between inflammatory markers (AOPP/nitrite: r\u200a=\u200a0.877), inflammation and antioxidant/oxidant status (AOPP/glutathione peroxidase (GPX): r\u200a=\u200a0.902, AOPP/GSH: r\u200a=\u200a0.806, Nitrite/GPX: 0.773, Nitrite/LPO: 0.805, MDA/MPO: 0.718), and antioxidant/oxidant levels (GPX/MDA: r\u200a=\u200a0.768) in chagasic subjects. Of these, MPO, LPO and nitrite biomarkers were highly specific and sensitive for distinguishing seropositive/chagasic subjects from seronegative/healthy controls (p<0.001, training and fitting AUC/ROC >0.95). The MPO (r\u200a=\u200a0.664) and LPO (r\u200a=\u200a0.841) levels were also correlated with clinical disease state in chagasic subjects (p<0.001). Seronegative/cardiac subjects exhibited up to 77% decline in SOD, 3\u20135-fold increase in LPO and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) levels, and statistically insignificant change in MPO, AOPP, MDA, GPX, GSH, and creatine kinase (CK) levels.",
    "Conclusions": "The interlinked effects of innate immune responses and antioxidant/oxidant imbalance are major determinants of human Chagas disease. The MPO, LPO and nitrite are excellent biomarkers for diagnosing seropositive/chagasic subjects, and MPO and LPO levels have potential utility in identifying clinical severity of Chagas disease."
