Chagas disease is a chronic disease of the heart, and caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection. In this study, we have monitored the biomarkers of inflammation caused by innate immune cells, oxidative stress, and antioxidant status in seropositive/chagasic, seronegative/cardiac disease, and seronegative/healthy subjects. Our goal was to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of selected biomarkers, and determine if any of the biomarkers are good indicators of clinical severity of Chagas disease. We also determined whether sera or plasma serve as a better source, and if sample storage affects the estimation of the selected biomarkers. Our data suggest that innate immune responses and antioxidant/oxidant imbalance are inter-linked pathological events in Chagas disease. We have identified peripheral blood markers (myeloperoxidase, lipid hydroperoxides and nitrite) that strongly distinguish seropositive/chagasic subjects from controls. Further, we found that myeloperoxidase and lipid hydroperoxide levels have potential utility in identifying seropositive subjects at risk of developing clinically symptomatic disease.
