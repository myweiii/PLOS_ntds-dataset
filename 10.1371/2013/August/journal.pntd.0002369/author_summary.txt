Chagas disease, considered one of the most neglected tropical diseases, is caused by the blood-borne parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and currently affects about 8 million people in Latin America. T. cruzi can be transmitted by insect vectors, blood transfusion, organ transplantation and mother-to-baby as well as through ingestion of contaminated food. Although T. cruzi causes life-long infections that can result in serious damage to the heart, the two drugs currently available to treat Chagas disease, benznidazole and nifurtimox, which have been used for more than 40 years, have proven efficacy only during the acute phase of the disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs that are more targeted, less toxic, and more effective against this parasite. Here we described the characterization of T. cruzi genes involved in the biosynthesis of GPI anchors, a molecule responsible for holding different types of glycoproteins on the parasite membrane. Since GPI anchored proteins are essential molecules T. cruzi uses during infection, besides helping understand how this parasite interacts with its host, this work may contribute to the development of better therapies against Chagas disease.
