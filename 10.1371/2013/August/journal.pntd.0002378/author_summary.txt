Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are endemic in Honduras but their impact on children's health is not well studied. With the purpose of determining the prevalence and intensity of STH infections and their association with nutritional status in a sample of Honduran children, a cross-sectional study was undertaken in 2011. School-age children were enrolled, and in addition to demographic data, blood and stool samples and anthropometric measurements were obtained to determine nutritional status and STH infection. The overall STH prevalence among 320 studied children was 72.5% and almost half of the infected children harboured multiple parasites. Polyparasitism was more likely to occur in children attending schools with absent or annual deworming schedules than in pupils attending schools deworming twice a year. Prevalence by species was 30%, 67% and 16% for Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworms, respectively. Infections of moderate to heavy intensity as well as multiparasite infections were significant predictors of decreased weight-for-age scores in children ages 7â€“10 years after controlling for key confounders. Sustainable efforts to control STH infections in Honduras are required. Future research providing more insight on the nutritional impact of polyparasitic STH infections in childhood is necessary.
