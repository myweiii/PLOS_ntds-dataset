Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. About 200 million people are affected worldwide. Also travelers are at risk as even a brief contact with infested freshwater can cause infection. S. mansoni and S. haematobium are the two main species that are identified in travelers and migrants. The eggs of these parasites are respectively excreted in feces and urine, and the diagnosis relies mostly on microscopy. In travelers, infections are easily missed due to low worm load or because egg excretion is not yet started upon arrival. Consequently, there is need for sensitive diagnostic tools that can be used in the early stage of infection. A previously published study reported the ability to detect S. mansoni DNA in serum by real-time PCR. To enable the diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis, we developed a PCR to detect S. haematobium DNA in serum. We demonstrated that the latter PCR is more sensitive than microscopy when applied on feces and urine, and, when performed on serum, particularly useful to confirm diagnosis during acute urogenital schistosomiasis. We comment on the plausible origin of parasite DNA in relation to the different life cycle stages present in the blood circulation.
