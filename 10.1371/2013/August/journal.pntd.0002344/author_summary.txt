The mini-FLOTAC has been recently developed as a novel direct method for the diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infections. Mini-FLOTAC attempts to address the challenge of using modern technology matched with high sensitivity, affordability, and appropriateness of diagnosis in resource-limited settings where intestinal parasitic infections are widespread. We compared accuracy and feasibility of mini-FLOTAC with currently more widely used diagnostic methods, such as the direct fecal smear and the formol-ether concentration method. Our study was carried out in Dharamsala, India, and in Bukumbi, Tanzania in order to evaluate the methods under different field conditions and diverse parasitic infection profiles. Among 180 primary schoolchildren examined, 72% were positive for any intestinal parasitic infection. Mini-FLOTAC detected the highest number of helminth infections (90% sensitivity), whereas the formol-ether concentration was the most sensitive approach for intestinal protozoa infections (88% sensitivity). The logistic advantages of mini-FLOTAC are that the procedure does not require any centrifugation step or expensive equipment, it can be performed on fresh and fixed stool samples, and only requires 10â€“12 min of preparation before microscopic analysis. Our data suggest that mini-FLOTAC is a promising diagnostic tool for helminth diagnosis; therefore, follow-up studies in other settings are warranted.
