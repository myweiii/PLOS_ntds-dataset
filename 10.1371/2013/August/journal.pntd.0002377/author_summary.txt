Schistosomiasis remains one of the most serious and prevalent diseases worldwide. Despite intensive control efforts by the government and international bodies, schistosomiasis is the second cause of death, after malaria, in Yemen, with an estimated 3 million cases. We screened 400 children in rural areas of five provinces in Yemen for the presence of schistosomiasis. Overall, 31.8% of the children were found to be positive for schistosomiasis; 23.8% were infected by Schistosoma haematobium, and 9.3% were infected by S. mansoni. The study identified the presence of other family members infected with schistosomiasis, low household monthly income, using unsafe water supply as a source for drinking water, living nearby stream/spring and/or pool/pond as the key factors significantly associated with schistosomiasis in these communities. Innovative and integrated control measures to control this infection should be implemented among this population. Periodic school-based and community-based drug distribution, health education, provision of clean and safe drinking water, introduction of proper sanitation will help to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of schistosomiasis among these communities.
