Approximately half of the world's population is at risk of viral, mosquito-borne illness such as dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, and chikungunya. In the past, these viruses have been regarded as pathogens of the tropics; however, they are emerging as global causes of illness. Very few effective drugs and vaccines have been developed for mosquito-borne viral infections and even less are available to people in resource-limited countries. An important aspect of disease prevention is mosquito surveillance to determine geographical range and seasonal prevalence of the associated viruses. However, there are hundreds of viruses transmitted by mosquitoes that are pathogenic to humans and animals. Using a portable microarray, we developed an assay with the ability to detect most of the known medically important viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. This assay was designed for use in conjunction with broad-range screening tools as a cost effective, rapid method to determine the identity of viruses from infected mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive assay to date for field surveillance of mosquito-borne viruses.
