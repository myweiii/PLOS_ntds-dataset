The impact of malnutrition in the world is staggering. Malnutrition is thought to directly or indirectly contribute to more than half of all childhood deaths, most of them related to heightened susceptibility to infection. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by the intracellular protozoan Leishmania donovani, is a progressive, potentially fatal infection found in many resource-poor regions of the world. Most people who get infected with this parasite have only an asymptomatic latent infection, however, people who are malnourished have a greatly increased risk of developing severe VL. We initiated these studies of an experimental model that mimics human childhood malnutrition to better understand how malnutrition increases the susceptibility to VL at the molecular and cellular level. In this model we found that malnutrition led to failure of the skin-draining lymph node to act as a barrier to dissemination. This loss of lymph node barrier function was associated with a significant reduction in the numbers of dendritic cells and macrophages, phagocytic cells that capture and kill invading pathogens, and alteration of the flow of lymph through the lymph node.
