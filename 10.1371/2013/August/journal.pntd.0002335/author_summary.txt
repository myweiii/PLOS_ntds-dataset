Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi is the cause of typhoid fever and infects over 21 million individuals and causes 200,000 deaths each year. With adequate treatment, most patients recover from their acute stage of illness and clear infection. However, a small percentage of S. Typhi infected individuals develop a chronic but asymptomatic infection in the biliary tract that can persist for decades. Since S. Typhi is a human-restricted pathogen, chronic carriers may act as reservoirs of infection. Correctly identifying and treating asymptomatic chronic carriers could be critical for ultimate control of typhoid fever. Using an immunoscreening technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT), we have identified potential biomarkers unique to S. Typhi chronic carriers. Further evaluation of these antigens could lead to the development of improved diagnostic assays to detect asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers in typhoid endemic zones, and to an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of S. Typhi in the chronic carrier state.
