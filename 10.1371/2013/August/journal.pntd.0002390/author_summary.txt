Paracoccidioidomycosis is a deep mycosis that is endemic in Latin America, mostly affecting rural workers of Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection is acquired upon the inhalation of airborne propagules derived from the saprophytic mycelium form of the fungus. Once in the lungs, P. brasiliensis converts to its parasitic yeast form and interacts with alveolar macrophages. This phagocytic cell is specialized in secreting cytokines, lipid mediators, and microbicidal molecules that control the fungal growth. Among the lipid mediators generated by macrophages, 5-LO-derived leukotrienes play an important role in lung innate immunity and are known to be important for neutrophil recruitment and activation. Here, we evaluated whether leukotrienes are involved in the immune response in a murine model of P. brasiliensis infection. 5-LO-deficient mice exhibited high mortality, severe lung pathogenesis and increased fungal burden in the lungs, associated with less activation of macrophages, resulting in lower phagocytosis and P. brasiliensis killing. These results reveal for the first time that endogenous production of leukotrienes, especially LTB4, is important for assembling a protective immune response of the host against P. brasiliensis.
