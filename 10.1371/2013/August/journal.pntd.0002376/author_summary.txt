The Trypanosoma cruzi protozoan infects 9 million people in Latin America and increasing numbers in North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan. It is an important neglected parasitic disease in the Americas with no safe treatment available. One third of those infected develops incapacitating pathology. While in poor countries transmission of the parasite is mainly through blood feeding insects, transplacental infection is increasingly important in developed regions. Herein we show that T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT), a multifunctional protein, exteriorized by the parasite, mediates infection of human placenta, since it binds human complement component C1, a “danger signal” detector. (Complement is an innate immune defense system, with more than 40 plasma or membrane-bound proteins). However, in a parasite strategy, maternal C1 is utilized to infect placenta. Fetal calreticulin (HuCRT) is also easily detectable in placental tissues that are in direct contact with maternal blood. Thus, C1q by bridging parasite and HuCRT mediates high increases in cultured placental tissue infection with damaging consequences. Complete reversion of C1-mediated infection and a decreased placental damage, is observed in the presence of anti-TcCRT and anti-HuCRT antibody fragments, or fluid-phase competing HuCRT. It remains to be determined whether these mechanisms also operate in other intracellular protozoa.
