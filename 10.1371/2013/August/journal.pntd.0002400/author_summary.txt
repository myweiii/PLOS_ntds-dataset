This work was conducted to determine the use of herbal treatment among a group of eumycetoma patients. As mycetoma is a good example of a badly neglected tropical disease across the world, many mycetoma patients tend to present late with advanced infection, one of the important reasons for which is the use of herbal medicine for quite a long time; hence, this study was conducted to determine that. The study showed that a good number of the patients used it, many of them not aware of the type of herbs used. This treatment was associated with many complications. Raising the patients' and community's awareness on the negative impacts of this treatment is important to decrease its use and complications and to encourage patients to present early for medical treatment.
