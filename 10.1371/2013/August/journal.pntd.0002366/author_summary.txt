The rapid diagnostic test (RDT) Crystal VC detects lipopolysaccharide antigens from V. cholerae O1 and O139 in stool samples, which are also present in the oral cholera vaccine Shanchol. It is important to take into consideration the possibility of a positive result to the RDT due to vaccination and not to cholera in recently vaccinated individuals. During a large mass cholera vaccination campaign in Kabak (Guinea) in 2012, we conducted a study to estimate the proportion of positive results to the RDT in recipients of the oral cholera vaccine at different time points after vaccination. The results of this study show that ingestion of the cholera vaccine led to a positive RDT, although almost exclusively to the O139 antigen, in the majority of vaccinated people. From the fifth day after vaccination, only a small minority of vaccinated individuals remained positive for the RDT and none of the specimens tested the seventh day of follow-up were positive. Our findings provide the first data on the use of the RDT Crystal VC in vaccinated people. This test should be used carefully during the first week after reactive mass oral cholera vaccination campaigns in areas where V. cholerae O139 is present.
