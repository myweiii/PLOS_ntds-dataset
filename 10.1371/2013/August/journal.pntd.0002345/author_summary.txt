African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT) is a neglected tropical disease heavily impacting on the poor. Sensitive diagnostic tools are needed since actual parasitaemia levels can be very low, particularly in chronically infected or trypanotolerant animals. Hence, we present a novel real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for the simultaneous detection of the three AAT species (T. congolense, T. brucei and T. vivax). Thereby infected animals can be accurately detected in one step. 368 individuals from three cattle types (Baoulé, Zebu and hybrids) originating from 72 farms in Burkina Faso were analysed. Farmers were interviewed and morphometric measurements of the cattle taken to detect potential risk factors of infection. In our study, the overall rate of prevalence detected with the novel qPCR assay was 11.14% (41/368) compared to 10.87% (40/368) with conventional PCR. Zebus are most often infected (21.74%) compared to Baoulé (9.70%) and hybrid (9.57%) cattle. Except for breed, no significant correlation with other tested parameters could be detected. Baoulé show significantly less infections and therefore provide a unique and valuable genetic resource. In summary, with this novel qPCR technique the three AAT species can be simultaneously detected in a fast and sensitive manner.
