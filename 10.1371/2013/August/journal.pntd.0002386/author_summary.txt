Echinococcosis is a complex zoonosis for which there is sparse evidence on the effectiveness of control strategies in diverse settings. This presents significant challenges for the design of effective public health policy against this disease. Mathematical modelling is a useful tool for simulating control packages under locally specific transmission conditions to inform optimal timing and frequency of phased interventions for cost-effective control of echinococcosis. This systematic review of 30 years of Echinococcus modelling discusses the importance of six key epidemiological mechanisms underpinning models of Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis transmission and establishes the need to include a human transmission component. Accounting for the dynamic behaviour of the Echinococcus parasites in humans will be key to predicting changes in the disease burden over time and to simulate control strategies that optimise public health impact.
