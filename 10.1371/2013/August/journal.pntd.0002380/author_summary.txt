There is an overlap in the worldwide distribution of intestinal worms (helminths), malaria and HIV. Co-infections with helminth and malaria parasites cause a significant problem in the host, particularly in the presence of HIV infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of intestinal worm and malaria infection and co-infections and the associated risk factors among HIV-positive pregnant women that attended rural and peri-urban health centers in Rwanda. Our findings indicate that intestinal worms were more common among HIV-infected pregnant women in the rural than peri-urban settings. HIV-positive pregnant women who had lower CD4 cell counts were more at risk of being infected by intestinal worms and malaria. Malaria also increased the risk of being infected by intestinal worms and vice versa. Socio-economic factors such as lack of education and unemployment were among the risk factors for intestinal worm infections and malaria. Hand washing was found to reduce the risk for worm infections; whilst one particular ART combination (AZT-3TC-NVP) led to a reduced rate of helminth infections when compared to others.
