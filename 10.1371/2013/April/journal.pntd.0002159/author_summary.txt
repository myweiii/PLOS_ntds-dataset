Dengue is a potentially fatal acute febrile illness that is endemic throughout the tropics and sub-tropics. Dengue has been endemic in Puerto Rico for several decades and recent epidemics occurred in 1994–5, 1998 and 2007. In January 2010, dengue surveillance indicated that an epidemic had begun. The epidemic peaked in early August and ended in December with a total of 26,766 suspected dengue cases identified, of which 128 were fatal. The 2010 epidemic was one of the longest in Puerto Rico history and resulted in the greatest number of cases and deaths ever detected. We analyzed the epidemiologic and immunologic characteristics of laboratory-confirmed dengue cases and age group-specific attack rates, and determined the frequency of first DENV infection and DENV-types among persons experiencing their first infection. This analysis indicated that 10–19 year-olds were most affected during the epidemic, and that DENV-1 was roughly four times more likely to be associated with clinically apparent illness upon first DENV infection than were DENV-2 or -4. The 2010 dengue epidemic demonstrated the heavy burden of illness due to dengue in Puerto Rico, re-emphasizing the critical need for effective primary prevention tools to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to dengue worldwide.
