Despite being considered a relatively benign disease, Plasmodium vivax infection has been recently associated with fatal outcomes. The mechanisms contributing to severe disease in P. vivax malaria remain largely unknown, although scarce evidences suggests that similarly to P. falciparum, P. vivax may also adhere to host receptors on the vascular endothelium or on uninfected erythrocytes to form ‘rosettes’. Such cytoadhesion phenotypes might contribute to mild sequestration of P. vivax and poor clinical outcomes. The present study aimed to describe clinically relevant cytoadhesive phenotypes of P. vivax infected erythrocytes isolated from peripheral blood of pregnant and non-pregnant patients in the Brazilian Amazon. We did not observe any specific cytoadhesion phenotype associated to pregnancy, although a P. vivax haplotype was more frequent among pregnant women than in non-pregnant hosts. This finding suggests that other parasite phenotypes still unknown may increase the propagation of certain P. vivax clones among pregnant hosts. In addition, we found that rosetting was a frequent cytoadhesive phenotype in P. vivax infections that was associated with an increased risk of anaemia. This study places cytoadhesion and specifically rosetting as a target for the development of new therapies to treat or prevent life-threatening P. vivax malaria.
