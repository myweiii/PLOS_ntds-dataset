Upon outbreak of zoonotic viral diseases in herds of animals, early detection of naturally infected animals and prevention of further viral spread are important for minimizing the impact of outbreak in the society. Vaccination may compromise the identification of infected animals since both natural infection and vaccination induce antibodies specific to the pathogen. Therefore, new generation vaccines should have a marker to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen which can cause hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders or blindness in humans and a high-rate abortion in ruminants. MP-12 strain, a live-attenuated candidate vaccine, is safe and immunogenic, but lacks a DIVA marker. In this study, we developed and characterized improved MP-12 viruses which encode a DIVA marker by replacing the virulence gene with that of serologically distinct viruses belonging to the same genera. The novel MP-12 variant with such DIVA marker was highly efficacious and replicated efficiently in human diploid cells for vaccine production, and will become alternative candidate vaccines of MP-12 for veterinary applications.
