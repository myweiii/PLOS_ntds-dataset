Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that infects human macrophages, producing the neglected tropical disease known as leishmaniasis. As is the case for apoptotic cells, transient exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of the parasite is required for macrophage engulfment and infection. Although the mechanism involved in this lipid translocation remains unknown, inhibition of PS exposure could therefore prove to be a novel way to combat this parasitic disease. Here, we have identified a new ABC transporter from Leishmania, namely LABCG2, as a protein involved in this process. The dominant-negative inhibition of LABCG2 showed that this transporter is required for the normal exposure of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This altered phenotype was subsequently found to be correlated with a deficient ability to infect mouse peritoneal macrophages. In addition, studies in a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis showed that animals infected with parasites with down-regulated LABCG2 activity did not develop any lesions. Taken together, these results suggest a role for the Leishmania LABCG2 transporter in PS exposure, determining the virulence of the parasite.
