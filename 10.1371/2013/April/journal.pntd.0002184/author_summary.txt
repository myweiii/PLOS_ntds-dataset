West Nile virus (WNV) is mantained in the environment in a cycle between mosquitoes and birds. The virus has been isolated on almost all the continents, and several migratory bird species are primarily responsible for virus spread and dispersal. Humans acquire the infection through WNV-infected mosquito bites. Although most infected humans remain symptoms-free, in a minority of cases (especially in the elderly or immunocompromised patients) the infection can develop into a neuroinvasive form causing life-threatening encephalitis and threatening meningitis. Diagnosis of WNV is based primarily on serological tests, i.e. the detection of the virus-specific antibodies in human serum. Our aim was to collect updated information regarding the performance accuracy of WNV serological diagnostic tests used by laboratories involved in WNV diagnostics, in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses of diagnostic techniques in each laboratory. The performance of diagnostic tests varied among the laboratories, indicating that there is still a need to improve test procedures and to harmonize protocols.
