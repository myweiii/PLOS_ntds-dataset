Nutritional deficiencies are common in women in rural and disadvantaged regions, and, in particular, iron and folate deficiencies may impact their health and that of their offspring. Weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular deworming help to prevent these deficiencies, yet many women in developing countries do not have access to these interventions. Using the local health system, we implemented a weekly iron-folic acid supplementation program with regular deworming for approximately 250,000 women in a rural mountainous province of Viet Nam. We present the results of a survey of women's iron and worm infection status after the program has been running for 54 months. Overall, anemia prevalence fell from 38% to 18%, iron deficiency fell from 23% to 8% and the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was reduced to 4%. The level of moderate or heavy infestation of any soil-transmitted worm infection was reduced to less than 1%. These results show that a health system-based program can reduce and maintain the prevalence of these diseases in the community at a level where they do not constitute a public health risk.
