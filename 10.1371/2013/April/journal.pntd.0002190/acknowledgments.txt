We would like to thank W. K. Reisen for continued support of our use of containment facilities, lab space and fruitful discussions, A. Ponlawat for collecting and sending mosquito eggs, and three anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on an earlier version of the manuscript. This research benefited from discussions with M. B.

Paaijmans, and working group members in the Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program of the Science and Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security, and the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health.
