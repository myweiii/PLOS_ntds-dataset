Until recently, elimination of onchocerciasis (river blindness) from Africa by mass treatment with ivermectin alone was deemed impossible. However, recent reports of elimination of onchocerciasis from various African foci have stimulated renewed interest. An important determinant of achieving elimination is the pre-control microfilarial (mf) prevalence, i.e. the percentage of people with larval stages of the Onchocerca volvulus worm in the skin, which can be detected in a skin snip (a small skin biopsy). Because this method is considered invasive, pre-control infection levels in Africa have been mapped mostly by means of palpation of subcutaneous nodules (protuberances under the skin where the adult worms live) in adult males, a relatively crude but non-invasive method of detecting infection. We developed a tool to derive estimates of pre-control mf prevalence from available pre-control nodule prevalence estimates. This tool can help evaluate ongoing control programs, help assess local elimination prospects, and help estimate levels of disease due to onchocerciasis by linking pre-control nodule palpation data to the large body of literature on the association between mf prevalence and disease.
