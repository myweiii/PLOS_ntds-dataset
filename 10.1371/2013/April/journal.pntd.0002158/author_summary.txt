Vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease has not been effectively controlled in large parts of Latin America, particularly in the Gran Chaco ecoregion. To better understand the challenges in this region, we assessed the effectiveness of an intensified insecticide-based spraying strategy in suppressing the major vector Triatoma infestans from a well-defined rural area in northern Argentina. After an initial community-wide spraying, we intensively monitored infestation every 4â€“7 months for 35 months and applied insecticides selectively to the detected foci. In addition to the moderate levels of pyrethroid resistance reported in parallel, we found that selectively spraying only infested sites performed poorly. Prespraying bug abundance and the characteristics of infested sites before the initial interventions were reliable predictors of postspraying site infestation, including the type and use of the site and availability of refuges for the vector. We conclude that professional vector control based on residual insecticide spraying in an area with moderate pyrethroid resistance requires intense monitoring of house infestation, systematic insecticide applications and appropriate management actions. Operational, economic and political constraints to sustainable vector and disease elimination require complementary tools and approaches that favor changes in material conditions which reduce habitat suitability for the vector.
