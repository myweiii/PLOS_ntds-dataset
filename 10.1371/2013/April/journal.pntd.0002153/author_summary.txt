Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a serious disease, especially in children, in large parts of Asia. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and mainly known as a disease in the rural, rice-producing areas in South and Southeast Asia. Here, the authors show that of 43 pigs sampled in Can Tho city, South Vietnam, all had antibodies to JE virus (JEV), and since some of these were born in the city, they must have been infected within the urban area. Mosquitoes were collected during night at households both in the city and in a rural area, using traps that attract mosquitoes with light. The mosquitoes were analyzed to see if they had JEV in them. Two different types of JEV were found in mosquito samples collected at urban households. One of these, genotype I, has been emerging in Northern Vietnam and was now shown to be circulating together with the older genotype III. These findings suggest a risk of JEV transmission from pigs to humans in urban areas, or in other words, that JE should not be regarded as a rural disease only.
