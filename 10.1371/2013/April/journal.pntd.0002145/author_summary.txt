Cholera is the prototypical “waterborne” disease that can provoke deadly acute watery diarrhea epidemics in settings deprived of clean water and proper sanitation. In spite chronic deprivation, Haiti had been spared cholera for a century until the vibrio was imported in October 2010, which triggered the largest national epidemic ever recorded. To better understand the progression of the epidemic and adapt control measures, we describe and analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics and underlying factors associated with the first year of this cholera epidemic in Haiti. Attack rates reached highly heterogeneous levels between communes (from 64.7 to 3070.9 cases per 10,000 inhabitants), thereby suggesting disparate outbreak processes. While the first principal outbreak spread centrifugally like a damping wave that suddenly emerged from Mirebalais and Lower Artibonite, a second principal outbreak erupted at the end of May 2011, concomitant with the rainy season, and displayed a highly fragmented epidemic pattern. Environmental factors, such as rivers and rice fields, appeared to play a role in disease dynamics exclusively during the beginning of the epidemic. The dynamics of the cholera epidemic varied from place to place as time passed, following no clearly predictable scheme. Therefore, cholera control measures in Haiti should include rapid and exhaustive case tracking.
