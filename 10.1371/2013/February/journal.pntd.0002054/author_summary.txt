Schistosomiasis mansoni is a debilitating and sometimes fatal disease that affects many individuals in Africa and Brazil. Currently available diagnostic methods are not sensitive for patients with low parasite load which leads to underreported cases. The selection of target diagnostic antigen candidates is a promising tool for the development of a new and more sensitive assay. In this study, we focused on different types of circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) for development of an innovative assay. This new assay is called immunomagnetic separation and it uses magnetic microspheres attached to the antigens in order to improve the diagnostic sensitivity. Best results were found when we used the protein chain of the recombinant CCA showing high sensitivity and specificity with no false-negative results. Together, the use of “crude antigen” presented good results for the control of cure. Our new assay was superior to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in discriminating positive and negative cases, especially related to patients with low parasite load.
