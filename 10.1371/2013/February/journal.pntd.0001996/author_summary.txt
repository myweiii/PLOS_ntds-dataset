Chronic Chagas heart disease (CHHD) caused by the infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the most important infectious heart disease in the world. The typical manifestations are dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure; they result from death of cardiomyocytes and their replacement by collagen. Knowing the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte death is important for the development of therapies that prevent them. The contribution of apoptosis in cardiomyocyte death was evaluated in the guinea pig model of T. cruzi infection, and the detection of serum levels of collagen precursors were evaluated as biomarkers of cardiac fibrosis. We observed apoptosis of lymphocytes, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and epicardial adipose tissue in cardiac tissue of infected guinea pigs. The increase of serum levels of collagen precursors PICP and PIIINP were associated with cardiac fibrosis. Areas of inflammation and apoptosis of epicardial adipose tissue were associated with cardiac pathology, which suggests the importance of epicardial adipose tissue in CCHD. These results show that apoptosis is an important characteristic of cardiac cell death during CCHD and serum levels of PICP and PIIINP could be used as biomarkers of cardiac fibrosis.
