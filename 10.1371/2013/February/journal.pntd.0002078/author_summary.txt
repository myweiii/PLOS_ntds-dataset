Chagas disease (ChD), caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in most Latin America countries and may be transmitted via blood transfusions. Cardiac disease is a major feature of chronically infected patients and may be lethal. Universal blood bank screening for ChD has been established in most Latin American countries, as well as in non-endemic countries with large immigrant populations, including the United States, Canada, Spain and Portugal. Blood donor screening leads to large numbers of new diagnoses of chronic T. cruzi infection. Counseling these individuals should address the recognition of those with more severe disease that deserve to be rigorously evaluated by experienced cardiologists and treated more promptly. The electrocardiogram is an important exam that can help in the recognition of cardiac disease and the evaluation of prognosis in ChD patients, but its role in blood donors has not been studied. The authors describe some electrocardiographic abnormalities that are typical of the infected blood donors, as well ECG abnormalities that help in the identification of those with severe cardiac involvement. These results may guide the evaluations of patients with incidentally detected T. cruzi infection from blood bank testing or public health screening.
