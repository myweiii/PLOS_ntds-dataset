Cholera is acute watery diarrhoea, severely dehydrating, caused by Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium ubiquitous in aquatic environments. Cholera is a global threat, particularly, in areas where sanitary conditions, such as drinking water and sewage, are not available. Seven cholera pandemics, all originating in Asia, occurred. The ongoing pandemic, the 7th, has been caused by V. cholerae El Tor biotype. Recently, El Tor has undergone genetic changes and the strains being referred to as “atypical” El Tor are rapidly replacing the original El Tor in many areas. The atypical El Tor is characterized by multi-antibiotic resistance and changes in the major virulence determinants. Cholera caused by atypical strains may be more clinically severe. In Africa, cholera outbreaks are occurring with increasing frequency and severity, as demonstrated by the recent major outbreaks in Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Here, we performed a comprehensive characterization of V. cholerae isolated from different recent outbreaks in Nigeria. Our results show that cholera outbreaks in Nigeria are driven by atypical El Tor strains, as worldwide.
