Glossina swynnertoni is restricted to open savannah in north-western Tanzania and south-western Kenya, where it is a vector of both human and animal trypanosomiasis in wildlife reserves and in neighbouring conservation areas used by pastoralists. Despite the challenge to minimize disease transmission through effective management of the vector in the presence of abundant wildlife reservoirs, little has been done to test the efficacy of modern tsetse traps or targets for controlling G. swynnertoni. We made field tests in the Serengeti and Maasai Mara to determine the most visually-attractive, long-lasting and practical object that induces the strongest landing response in G. swynnertoni. Fly landings were twice as high on 1 m2 blue-black targets as on pyramidal traps when equivalent areas of these devices were covered with adhesive film. Furthermore, blue leg panels in either cloth or plastic and blue or blue-black-blue cloth targets under half the size of traditional targets captured tsetse at equivalent numbers per unit as the latter. These smaller targets and leg panels show promise as cost-effective devices for management of G. swynnertoni populations as they can be used for both control (insecticide-impregnated cloth) and monitoring of this species (rigid plastic with insect glue or adhesive film).
