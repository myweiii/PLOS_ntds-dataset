Malaria during pregnancy remains a risk for approximately 125 million women each year. Adverse outcomes of malaria during pregnancy include maternal anemia and low infant birth weight. Additionally, the presence of malaria parasites, namely Plasmodium falciparum, has been associated with the occurrence of placental lesions. In the Amazonian region of Brazil Plasmodium vivax is the primary parasite species. To date, little is known about the capacity of this parasite to induce placental lesions. In this study we have used ten histological parameters to evaluate the effect of exposure to Plasmodium vivax during pregnancy on the occurrence of placental lesions when compared to placentas from non-exposed women. Placentas from women exposed to Plasmodium falciparum were used as controls. Placentas from Plasmodium vivax-exposed placentas did not have strong evidence of placental parasites but had increased syncytial knotting, thickness of the placental barrier and mononuclear cells when compared to non-exposed women. We developed a score based on these three parameters and not on the presence of placental parasites that enables us to visualize the effect that Plasmodium vivax has on placentas from women infected during pregnancy.
