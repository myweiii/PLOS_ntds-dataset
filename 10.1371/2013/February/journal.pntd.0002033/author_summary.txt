Mexico is one of the countries where human onchocerciasis (river blindness) can be found in Latin America. In 1989, the onchocerciasis program in Mexico started the treatment with ivermectin only for symptomatic individuals and then mass distribution of ivermectin was initiated for all eligible residents from 1994, either annually, twice or four times a year in endemic foci, coordinated by Mexican Secretariat of Health (MSH). In our study, we used a statistical method to analyse the cases of the disease reported by MSH from 1988 to 2011. The analysis showed that the cases of the disease have marginally decreased since 1999. The results also predicted an extremely low number (absence) of cases between 2012 and 2013 in the Chiapas region, the last endemic area, suggesting that disease is on a trend towards elimination in Mexico. Meanwhile, it could provide a benchmark for surveillance after mass treatment has been halted in 2012.
