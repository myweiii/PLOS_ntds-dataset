Chronic cardiomyopathy is the most common and severe manifestation of human Chagas' disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Among diverse inflammation-promoting moieties, eicosanoids and the vasoactive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) have been implicated in its pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the link between these two factors has not yet been identified. In the present study, we found that T. cruzi infection induces gene expression of ET-1 and eicosanoid-forming enzymes in the heart of infected mice. We also demonstrated that HL-1 atrial myocytes respond to ET-1 stimulus and T. cruzi infection by induction of cyclooxygenase-2 through activation of the Ca2+/calcineurin/NFAT intracellular signaling pathway. Moreover, the cooperation between T. cruzi and ET-1 leads to overproduction of eicosanoids (prostaglandins E2 and F2Î±, thromboxane A2) and the pro-hypertrophic atrial natriuretic peptide. Our results support an important role for NFAT in T. cruzi plus ET-1-dependent induction of key agents of pathogenesis in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. Identification of the Ca2+/calcineurin/NFAT cascade as mediator of cardiovascular pathology in Chagas' disease advances our understanding of host-parasite interrelationship and may help define novel potential targets for therapeutic interventions to ameliorate or prevent cardiomyopathy during chronic T. cruzi infection.
