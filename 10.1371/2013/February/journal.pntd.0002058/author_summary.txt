This study dealt with the ecological and epidemiological characterization of a newly emerged dermal disease caused by Leishmania parasites transmitted by the bite of infected sand flies. In the first five years of its emergence, the human infection rate in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu, Israel reached 16%. The majority of cases resided along the periphery of the Kibbutz. To identify the vector species, we performed systematic trapping of sand flies in different habitats inside and outside the inhabited areas. Sand flies were identified in the laboratory and shown to comprise mainly Phlebotomus papatasi. Since the causative agent of human cases was shown to be L. major, we examined sand flies for Leishmania infections by PCR and found a high infection rate amongst sand flies trapped near houses in late summer (11.8%). To confirm the Leishmania species, we isolated live parasites from the gut of a wild-caught sand fly female. The cultured isolate was identified as L. major by several methods. The Levant vole, abundant in the surrounding fields and Tristram's jird found further away from the Kibbutz were tested for infection rate and their capacity for hosting the parasite and were both incriminated as new possible hosts.
