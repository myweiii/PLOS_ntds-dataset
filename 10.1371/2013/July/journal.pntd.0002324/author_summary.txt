The syndrome of fever is caused by a large number of infectious diseases. Malaria is thought to have been declining in the tropics since 2004. Increasing use of malaria diagnostic tests reveal a growing proportion of patients with fever who do not have malaria. While malaria diagnostic tests may be available, healthcare workers have few tools to diagnose causes of fever other than malaria. In order to identify major causes of fever other than malaria in northern Tanzania, we studied 870 patients with fever who were sufficiently ill to require admission to hospital. Malaria was uncommon and over-diagnosed, whereas invasive infections, including bloodstream infections, were underappreciated. Infections associated with animals such as brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever, and spotted fever group rickettsioses as well as viral infections transmitted by mosquitoes were common yet overlooked. We recommend that research on the syndrome of fever in resource-limited areas should focus on a wide range of potential causes. Animal-associated infections should be prioritized in patient management and disease control.
