In the present study, the immunological profiles of HTLV-1 carriers with or without dermatological lesions were thoroughly described and compared. The results indicated that HTLV-1-infected patients with dermatological lesions have distinct frequency and activation status than asymptomatic carriers. Alterations in cells and molecules that are important for immune cell function were observed in the HTLV-1-infected group with skin lesions. Additionally, HTLV-1 carriers with dermatological skin lesions have elevated frequency of high proviral load as compared to asymptomatic carriers, which indicates that the virus may be present in higher frequency in those patients. Patients with different skin lesions, autoimmune or infectious, also demonstrated differences in their immunological profile. All in all, these results suggest a distinct and unique immunological profile in the blood of HTLV-1-infected patients with skin disorders, and the different nature of skin lesion observed in these patients may be an outcome of a distinct unbalance of the systemic inflammatory response upon HTLV-1 infection.
