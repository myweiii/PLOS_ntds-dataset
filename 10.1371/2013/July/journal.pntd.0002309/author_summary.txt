Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an important disease of ruminants that affects most African and Arabian Peninsula countries where domestic livestock is the basis for subsistence in rural areas. The disease is caused by a bunyavirus that can be transmitted by close contact with infected animals or through the bite of infected mosquitoes thus facilitating the spread of the virus. Safer and practical methods to control virus spread are demanded in order to prevent both human and animal disease after disease outbreaks. The efficacy of a recombinant modified poxvirus vector (the vaccinia modified Ankara virus (rMVA)) and/or DNA-based vaccines in a mouse infection model has been investigated. A single immunization with a rMVA encoding the virus envelope glycoproteins provided sufficient immunity to protect mice against a lethal dose of RVFV. The immune mechanisms underlying the protection were also investigated. A number of specific immune CD8+-T cells could be activated in the presence of at least three different glycoprotein epitopes. On the other hand, the protective effect of the vaccine was found only in immune competent mice since in mice lacking IFN-type-I responses the vaccine was not efficient.
