In mammals, secreted host defence peptides (HDPs) protect against a wide range of infectious pathogens. They also perform a range of immune modulatory functions which regulate the immune response to pathogens, ensuring that the protective inflammatory response is not exacerbated and that post-infection repair mechanisms are initiated. We identified a novel family of molecules secreted by medically-important helminth pathogens (termed helminth defence molecules; HDMs) that exhibit striking structural and biochemical similarities to the HDPs. To further investigate the extent of this similarity, we have performed a comparative functional study between several well characterized, anti-microbial, mammalian HDPs and a series of parasite-derived peptides. The parasite HDMs displayed immune modulatory properties that were similar to their HDP homologs in mammals, but possessed no antimicrobial or cytotoxic activity. We propose that HDMs of these helminth pathogens underwent specific adaptation, losing their anti-microbial activity but retaining their ability to regulate the immune responses of their mammalian hosts. This absence of cytotoxicity and retention of immune-modulatory activity offers an opportunity to design novel immunotherapeutics derived from the HDMs which could be used to combat destructive inflammatory responses associated with microbial infection and immune-related disorders.
