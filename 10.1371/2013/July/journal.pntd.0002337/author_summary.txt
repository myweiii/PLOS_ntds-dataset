Host blood ingested by adult schistosomes resident in the bloodstream, passes down a short esophagus to reach the gut where proteolysis of its constituents occurs. The esophageal gland surrounds the posterior half of the esophagus, which has a membrane surface area enormously expanded into plates that must be crucial for its functioning. The contents of a unique crystalloid vesicle, manufactured in the gland, are released into the lumen and accumulate between the plates. Incoming host leucocytes are tethered in the lumen of the posterior esophagus and damaged or destroyed there. Erythrocytes are also lysed as they enter the posterior esophagus. We have identified two further protein products of the gland, to add to the two we previously described, which may potentially interact with the incoming host cells to determine their fate. Finally, we have shown the antibodies from infected hosts can recognise and bind to the esophageal gland secretions. This raises the possibility that gland constituents may serve as a new source of candidates for both a therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine.
