We are grateful to Dr. Alain Michault and his team for technical assistance. We also thank the Regional Public Health Director from the Region of Vatovavy-Fitovinany (Dr. Albert Rasolofomanana) and the staff of the primary health care centre in Mananjary (Drs. Maurice Randriarison, Cyrille Rakotomalala and Jamesy Andriamanjara). This work is dedicated to the memory of the late Dr. Figaro from the primary health care centre in Toamasina, who consistently supported arbovirus surveillance work and always participated actively in all our studies.
