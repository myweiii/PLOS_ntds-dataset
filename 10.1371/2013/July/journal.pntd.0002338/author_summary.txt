Leprosy caused by Mycobacterium leprosy continues to be a public health challenge in developing countries. It manifests as a leprosy spectrum with varied clinical forms of localized (tuberculoid) and generalized (lepromatous) disease. Consensus on the immunological basis for leprosy spectrum is lacking. T helper subsets of Th1 and Th2 based on mutually exclusive cytokines IFN-Î³ and IL-4 respectively were considered as a basis for the inverse relationship between T cell functions and antibody responses seen in this disease. However, there are some patients who show Th0 subset which is non discriminatory and produce both cytokines. In the present study, we provide evidence for the presence of the recently described third subset of Th17 in both antigen stimulated PBMC and skin lesions of tuberculoid leprosy. They appear to be associated with Th0 profile and may represent a third type of effector cell in leprosy.
