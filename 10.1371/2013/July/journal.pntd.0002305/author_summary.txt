Tsetse flies are confined to tropical Africa and are carriers for trypanosomes, single-celled blood parasites. Through the bite of an infective tsetse, people and animals may contract trypanosomiasis, a degenerative disease leading to death if left untreated. Tsetse control proved effective for disease containment, but data on the flies as tsetse identification are a prerequisite for planning any control intervention. There are 32 generally accepted tsetse species and subspecies. Classical species identification relies on minor morphological differences, often challenging for field workers. In the last decade, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI) has revolutionised microbial species identification. After a simple protein extraction, a laser-induced ionisation takes place. Then, the ions are accelerated in a vacuum tube, and their Time of Flight (ToF) to reach the detector is recorded. The protein composition of each organism is unique, and so is their MALDI signature. Comparison of the obtained signature with a database of known organisms enables rapid identification as reliable as genome-based methods. To possibly speed up tsetse diagnostics, we established a MALDI database for the identification of five defined laboratory tsetse breeds. Inclusion of wild-caught tsetse could reinforce the reference database for the identification of tsetse at the species and subspecies level.
