Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is an etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, one of the most prevalent systemic mycosis in South America, affecting over 10 million people. One of the hallmark features of this fungus is its multinucleated nature, where a single P. brasiliensis cell can have from one to over 50 nuclei. Thus, fungal cell death may culminate in the release of large amounts of DNA and in the activation of the host innate immune system via toll like receptor (TLR) 9, a member of the TLR family. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of TLR9 activation during the infection by P. brasiliensis using an experimental model of P. brasiliensis infection of wild-type and TLR9−/− mice. We found that the lack of this receptor results in tissue damage and increased expression of cytokines, culminating in a higher death rate of TLR9−/− mice early post infection. This was mainly associated to neutrophils, as depletion of these cells, during the first 48 hours post-infection, converted the early response of TLR9−/− mice to infection to that of wild-type mice. Our work provides evidence for the protective effects of TLR9 activation during early stages of P. brasiliensis infection, highlighting the relevance of a balanced innate immune response to avoid tissue damage.
