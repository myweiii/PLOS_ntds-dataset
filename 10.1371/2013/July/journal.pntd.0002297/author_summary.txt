The most common fungal pathogen of the central nervous system, members of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex, causes life-threatening infection in humans with either normal or compromised immunity worldwide. The molecular epidemiology of this fungus in developing countries is highly under-investigated. Thus, three standard molecular typing methods were performed on 498 cryptococcal strains isolated from humans, the environment and animals in Thailand. As in developed countries, C. neoformans was found to be correlated with HIV infected patients and C. gattii infected humans with apparent normal immune status. Combining current and previous data, a total of 20 sequence types (ST) were identified suggesting a greater spectrum of major molecular types and genotypes of the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex in Thailand than previously reported. Moreover, the discovery of the minor genotype (ST7) of the Vancouver Island outbreak in Thailand indicates that Asia may be an important stepping stone in its global expansion. This study gives an insight in the molecular epidemiological picture of this important fungal pathogen and necessitates further detailed studies.
