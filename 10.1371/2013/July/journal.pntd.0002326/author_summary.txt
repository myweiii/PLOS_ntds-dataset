Snakebites cause life-threatening symptoms including uncontrolled bleeding and paralysis. The body's immune responses to snake venom may contribute to the severity of these symptoms but have not been well characterized in humans. Treatment with antivenom is potentially lifesaving, but also carries risk, as severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are common. Anaphylaxis occurs when mast cells, triggered by either allergen-specific antibodies, other immunological mechanisms, or non-immune mechanisms, release mediators that cause skin rashes, shortness of breath and, in severe cases, life-threatening hypotension and/or hypoxia. We have studied 120 snakebite victims in Sri Lanka, both before and after treatment with antivenom. Our results have shown snakebite triggers activation of the complement cascade (an important part of the body's innate immune defence) and production of proinflammatory mediators. In addition, we have demonstrated a quite astonishing level of immune activation after antivenom treatment in virtually every person treated, regardless of whether they had a reaction to the antivenom. Half of the patients treated experienced anaphylaxis, with clear evidence of mast cell activation. Anaphylaxis to antivenom is unlikely to be triggered by allergen-specific antibodies, as patients had not been previously exposed to antivenom, but may be related to the quality of available antivenom preparations, as well as a priming effect from the immune response to the venom itself.
