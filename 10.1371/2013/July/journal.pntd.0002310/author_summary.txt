In-depth understanding of health beliefs and behaviors may provide insights into sustainable community-based dengue prevention and control. This study uses qualitative method to explore dengue prevention and treatment-seeking behaviours. Focus group discussions were conducted with Malaysian public of various demographic backgrounds in Klang Valley, Malaysia. General knowledge about dengue fever was good but many lack of knowledge of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Many had low perceived susceptibility of getting dengue. Barriers to prevent dengue were categorised as low self efficacy to execute preventive measures, perceived lack benefit of individual preventive measures, and unsure susceptibility of getting dengue. Low perceived benefit of continued dengue prevention practices was a result of lack of concerted action against dengue in their neighborhood. Traditional medicinal practices, though unproven, were common and viewed as efficacious. The findings add valuable insights into how health beliefs could affect dengue prevention and control in endemic region.
