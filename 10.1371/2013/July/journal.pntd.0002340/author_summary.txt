Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental organisms that are naturally found in soil, water, dust and other sites. Several case reports and studies on the prevalence of pulmonary NTM disease have been published, nevertheless, the impact and the exact magnitude of NTM infections in countries where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic are not known. Here, we report the identification of NTM strains isolated from pulmonary samples from patients with a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary TB and residents of the State of Para, in the Amazon region, Northern of Brazil. This study documents the occurrence and diversity of species of NTM that cause pulmonary disease in a region representative of those in the world with high infection rates by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
