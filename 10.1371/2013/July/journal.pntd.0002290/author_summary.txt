Leptospirosis is one of the world's most spread zoonoses causing acute fever. The illness can rapidly develop into a severe, potentially fatal, form with a high mortality rate. Laboratory tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Culturing leptospires from patient material can take months to grow. Therefore, most used laboratory tests are based on detection of antibodies against leptospires. The microscopic agglutination test is considered the reference standard but is only performed at specialized laboratories. In this study, we measured the diagnostic accuracy of three rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) by doing a prospective evaluation during 11 years. These tests produce results within 15 minutes. The overall sensitivities (77%) and specificities (96%) were similar for the RDTs. Evaluating the first submitted specimen resulted in lower sensitivities (51% for LeptoTek Dri Dot, 69% for LeptoTek Lateral Flow, and 55% for Leptocheck-WB). When paired specimens were evaluated, the sensitivity increased although the specificity decreased (82% respectively 91% for LeptoTek Dri Dot, 86% respectively 84% for LeptoTek Lateral Flow, and 80% respectively 93% for Leptocheck-WB). Based on these results confirmation by reference tests is still strongly recommended, although the RDTs contribute to the diagnosis of leptospirosis, thus supporting clinical suspicion and contributing to awareness.
