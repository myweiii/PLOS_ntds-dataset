The soil-transmitted threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis is one of the most neglected helminth infections. It is endemic world-wide, yet more prevalent in hot and humid climates as well as resource poor countries with inadequate sanitary conditions. The difficult diagnosis and irregular excretion of larvae lead to an underreporting of infection rates. We reviewed the literature of the last 20 years reporting on infection rates of S. stercoralis. Including the sensitivity of diagnostic methods applied, we modeled and mapped for the first time country-wide prevalence estimates. The modeling was divided into studies reporting infection rates in the general population, in hospitals and on refugees & immigrants, respectively. We further summarized possible risk factors for S. stercoralis infection using meta-analysis. The most prominent risk factors include HIV-infection, HTLV-1 infection and alcoholism. Information on infection rates is missing in many countries. Our results show high prevalence estimates in many resource poor tropical and subtropical countries. We conclude that S. stercoralis should not be neglected and that further studies applying high sensitivity diagnostic methods are needed.
