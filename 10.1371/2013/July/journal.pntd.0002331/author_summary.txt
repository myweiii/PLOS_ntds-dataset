Acute febrile episodes are common in children living in tropical countries. Diagnosis can be challenging because symptoms of the more common infectious causes are similar and often mimic those of dengue. Asia Pacific has over 70% of the worldwide dengue disease burden, although dengue incidence is generally underestimated because most surveillance systems are passive or based on clinical diagnosis without laboratory confirmation. Understanding the local etiology of febrile illness and the incidence of dengue is important when planning large-scale vaccine trials. This prospective, active fever surveillance, cohort study was carried out in children in five dengue-endemic Asian countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam – during 2010–2011. Acute febrile episodes occurred in 289 (19.3%) of the cohort of 1,500 children. Among the diseases for which antibodies were tested using commercial kits, the top three causes of acute fever were chikungunya, Salmonella Typhi and dengue, followed by influenza A, rickettsia and hepatitis A. Dengue was confirmed in 11.4% of the febrile children by viral protein detection and in 23.9% by serology. Clinical diagnosis was not sufficient to detect all dengue cases. These findings are of relevance to those planning clinical studies of vaccines against these infectious agents in Southeast Asia.
