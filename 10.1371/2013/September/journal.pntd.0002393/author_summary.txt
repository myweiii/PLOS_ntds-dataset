Bartonella are bacteria transmitted by fleas, ticks, sandflies and other insects capable of infecting humans, domestic animals, livestock and wildlife, including marine mammals. In humans, they cause diseases such as trench fever, cat scratch disease, endocarditis, fever of unknown origin and have been recently associated with neurologic and neurocognitive abnormalities. Bartonella bacilliformis was first described in Peru in 1913, and it has never been detected in animals. Despite the fact that 14 other Bartonella species have been detected infecting humans around the world, no other Bartonella species has yet been described from Peruvian humans or domestic animals. We documented a significant number of healthy domestic dogs in Peru infected or exposed to two Bartonella species (B. rochalimae and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii), which are known to cause disease in humans. These same species were previously detected in human fleas and dog ticks in Peru, suggesting that vector transmission between dogs and humans may be possible. While the role of dogs as a source of Bartonella species for direct transmission to humans is not well understood, preventive measures including vector control in dogs should be implemented to prevent human infection.
