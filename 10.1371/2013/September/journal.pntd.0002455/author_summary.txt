Increasing interest is paid to blood-sucking arthropod's salivary antigens to develop host direct biomarkers of exposure. Nevertheless use of whole saliva is problematic both because of mass production and specificity issues. Here, we describe an in silico approach we used to identify potential epitopes on the amino acid sequence of three tsetse salivary proteins (Ada, Ag5 and Tsgf1) that were previously shown to be specifically recognized by antibodies from exposed individuals. Three candidate peptides were synthesized and evaluated on a set of plasma collected in different tsetse-infested and tsetse-free areas. The Tsgf118–43 synthetic peptide appeared as a promising candidate to assess human exposure to tsetse flies as antibody responses were low in all three control groups and were significantly higher in our two exposed groups. Significantly higher anti- Tsgf118–43 responses were also observed in sleeping sickness patients as compared to uninfected controls suggesting that Tsgf118–43 may be used both to assess human tsetse contacts and the risk of infection by trypanosomes. This new sero-epidemiological tool could thus help National Control Programs to quickly map human exposure levels in order to better target vector control efforts and monitor vector control efficiency.
