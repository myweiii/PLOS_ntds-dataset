CHIKV is characterized by acute and chronic polyarthritis/polyarthralgia that can be debilitating and protracted. Currently there are no FDA-approved vaccines or specific antiviral treatments for CHIKV. We thus identified and characterized human monoclonal antibodies directed against CHIKV that could be utilized in prophylactic and immediate post-exposure settings. Such patient derived monoclonal antibodies could also provide useful information on critical antigens and epitopes for development of future vaccines and other biologics. We describe here the identification of two monoclonal antibodies (C9 and E8) isolated from recovered patients. C9 potently inhibited CHIKV infection in cells and prevented viremia and arthritis in a mouse model of CHIKV disease. The epitope for this antibody includes an amino-acid residue in a key acid-sensitive region of the E2 glycoprotein of CHIKV. Rearrangement of this region following exposure to low pH is critical for uncovering portions of the companion E1 glycoprotein, required for successful entry of CHIKV into cells. We hypothesize that binding of antibodies to this region stabilizes the native complex and thus prevents such rearrangements.
