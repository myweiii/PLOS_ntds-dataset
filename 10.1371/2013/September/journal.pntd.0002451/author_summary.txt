The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) are the leading cause of mosquito-borne viral diseases in humans. Whereas infection with one DENV serotype is thought to confer protection against re-infection with that serotype, it can be either protective or enhance disease severity upon subsequent (“secondary”) infection with a different serotype. The envelope (E) protein of DENV is the major target of neutralizing antibodies. Previously, we and others reported that a significant proportion of anti-E antibodies in human dengue-immune sera recognize the fusion loop (FL) of E protein. The role of anti-FL antibodies in protection against subsequent DENV infections versus pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we developed capture ELISAs to measure the concentrations of anti-E and anti-FL antibodies in sera of Nicaraguan dengue patients collected 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post-illness, and investigated the kinetics of these antibodies and their relationship to neutralization activity. While the concentrations of anti-FL antibodies did not correlate with 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against the current infecting serotype, it correlated with NT50 against serotypes to which patients had likely not yet been exposed (“non-exposed” serotypes) in secondary DENV infections. These findings provide evidence that anti-FL antibodies play a protective role against “non-exposed” serotypes after secondary DENV infection.
