Dengue fever, caused by viruses transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is an important threat to public health in many tropical and subtropical countries. In the absence of a vaccine or specific drug treatment, prevention and control of dengue transmission relies on interventions targeting vector mosquito populations. In the city of Cucuta, Colombia, the insecticide temephos was used for several decades to control Ae. aegypti larvae, until resistance was recently reported. In this study, the resistance to temephos in this population was quantified, and its impact on control activities estimated using simulated field trials. The mechanisms underlying the resistance were determined to be metabolic, with several key detoxification enzymes identified as potential candidates. This should be taken into account when devising future vector control and insecticide resistance management strategies in this region of Colombia.
