While methods for vector control such as mosquito breeding source reduction and focal insecticide spraying that have been practiced to reduce dengue transmission in Indonesia have had limited success, dengue vaccines are expected to be an effective control method. However, even if an efficacious vaccine is developed, public acceptance and viable financing mechanisms are crucial for a successful introduction and sustainability of a new vaccination program. In this paper, we report public acceptance and willingness-to-pay for a hypothetical dengue vaccine for children that would be made available in the future. We found a very high proportion of surveyed participants, more than ninety-four percent, were willing to accept and pay for the vaccine. These findings provide a strong support for a dengue vaccination program. On the other hand, we also found a small possibility of reduction in vector control efforts if a dengue vaccination program is put in place. This could have a potential to increase the transmission of other vector-borne diseases and should be taken into account when introducing a dengue vaccination program.
