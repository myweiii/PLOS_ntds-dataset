Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent human malaria parasite outside Africa, responsible for significant morbidity, although it is commonly referred to as a benign malaria agent with respect to P. falciparum. Inferring the evolutionary history of an infectious agent provides important information for designing control measures. In this study, we developed a panel of novel molecular markers including housekeeping genes, minisatellites and microsatellites to infer the evolutionary history of P. vivax on the Indian subcontinent. The panel of markers uncovered an ancient and long evolutionary history and a stable population structure of P. vivax in India.
