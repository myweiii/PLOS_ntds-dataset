Crusted scabies is a severe skin condition caused by a microscopic parasitic mite. It occurs in people whose immune system does not react properly to the mite and it leads to crusting and cracking of the skin and can cause death. The usual treatment for crusted scabies is a tablet called ivermectin combined with anti-scabies skin creams. However, there is no current method of measuring the severity of crusted scabies and thus deciding how long to continue the treatment for. We have developed a grading scale based on examination of the skin, which classifies patients as mild, moderate or severe, and uses this grading to suggest the duration of treatment. We have trialed this grading scale over an 8-year period in 49 episodes of crusted scabies requiring hospital admission, and have found that it leads to a shorter length of hospital stay and treatment, but equivalent outcomes compared to those who were treated without the use of the grading scale.
