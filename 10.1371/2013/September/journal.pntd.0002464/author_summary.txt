The species L. major, L. tropica and L. infantum exist in Palestine and Israel where the first two cause CL and the third usually causes VL although cases of CL without visible signs of VL have been reported from Palestine. This means that diagnosis of locally acquired leishmaniases requires identification of their causative agents for further management of cases. Two molecular biological methods based on sequences from the genes of the enzymes HK and PGM and employing PCRs and consecutive RFLPs were developed and used together to distinguish among strains of the three species and between the two subtypes of L. tropica found in Palestinian foci that coincide with zymodemes MON-137 and MON-307. They were applied to, both, isolated parasites grown as promastigotes and to amastigotes in tissue preparations from cases and were able to identify strains and indicate their zymodemal affiliations.
