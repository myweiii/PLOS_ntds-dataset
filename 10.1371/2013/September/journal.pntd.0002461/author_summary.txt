Parasites of the Leishmania genus have developed multiple mechanisms to subvert the immune response. Among these mechanisms are the activation of host phosphatases and inactivation of cell signaling pathways, which in turn activate the immune response. On the other hand, it has been observed that the Myeloid Related Proteins (MRPs) 8 and 14 are potent activators of some components of the immune response. In this study, we evaluated the effect of MRPs 8 and 14 on the progression of cutaneous Leishmaniasis. To do so, we used immortalized macrophages and stimulated them with MRPs before or after infection with L. major. We observed that stimulating macrophages with MRPs prior to infection induced NO and TNF-α production, as well as phosphorylation of MAPKs and nuclear translocation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. However, when MRP stimulation was performed after infection, these effects where subverted. Moreover, using a murine model of cutaneous infection, we observed that depletion of MRPs caused increased parasite burden and bigger lesions. On the contrary, injection of recombinant MRPs directly into the lesion, considerably reduced lesion size and parasite burden. Our study suggests that MRPs could have a potential therapeutic use in the control of Leishmania infection.
