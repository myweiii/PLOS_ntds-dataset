Sand flies are the vectors of a number of pathogens that infect man, especially cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The control of sand flies through residual house-spraying insecticide has proven inefficient in preventing the spread of these diseases in several areas of the globe. Sand flies have a life cycle including eggs, larvae and pupae that are found in the ground, and winged adults. We developed a soil emergence trap that allowed us to identify chicken sheds as the preferred breeding sites for L. longipalpis that is the vector of visceral leishmaniasis in urban areas of municipalities in South-eastern region of Brazil. This finding opens up the possibility of controlling the immature stages which could complement the usual control strategies that focus on the adult fly.
