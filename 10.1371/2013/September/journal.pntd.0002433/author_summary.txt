Lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination requires interrupting transmission of microfilaria (mf) from humans to mosquitoes for 5â€“7 years, the average life span of adult worms. Current mf prevalence thresholds, below which transmission cannot be sustained, are unknown. Anopheline-transmitted LF is thought to be easily eliminated following community-wide distribution of anthelminthic drugs, based on this genera's poor vectorial ability. We observed up to a 30-fold difference in parasite yield in experimentally infected mosquitoes of the Anopheles punctulatus group, the primary vectors in Papua New Guinea. In two species, An. farauti and An. hinesorum, prevalence and intensity of infection were higher than what has previously been described for anopheline mosquitoes. Differences in vector competence were largely attributable to a failure of microfilaria to survive escape of the midgut. Other barriers to parasite development include damage upon ingestion and, to a lesser degree, melanization. These results challenge the assumption that anophelines are poor vectors and provide further insight as to why mass drug administration alone has been unsuccessful in stopping LF transmission in PNG. Large differences in vector competence among closely related species indicate that transmission thresholds will be site and vector specific, and control efforts should be tailored accordingly.
