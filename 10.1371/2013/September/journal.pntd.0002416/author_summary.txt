Nigeria is estimated to have the highest burden of lymphatic filariasis (LF), a disease also known as elephantiasis, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and caused by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. The National LF Elimination Programme is planning to scale up the elimination programme through mass drug administration of ivermectin and albendazole. However, a major constraint to this expansion is the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with the use of ivermectin in areas co-endemic with Loa, the causative agent of tropical eye worm (loiasis). To better understand this and other factors that may impact on LF elimination, we collated and mapped all available LF data, and highlighted the overlaps with predicted loiasis prevalence distributions, onchocerciasis ivermectin treatment areas, and bed net distributions for malaria. This study provides a baseline overview for the LF Programme and will help to maximize existing disease interventions, ensuring cost effective use of resources as the programme scales up.
