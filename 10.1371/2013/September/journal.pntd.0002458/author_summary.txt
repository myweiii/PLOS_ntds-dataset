Spinal cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a rare but malignant form of a truly neglected tropical disease. Despite modern diagnostic imaging techniques, the advances in surgery over the last decades and the availability of pharmacological therapy, the clinical management of spinal CE cases remains a challenge for the treating physician. Ten years after the last extensive review on the topic was published by Pamir et al. (Spinal Cord, 2002), we aim to provide clinicians with a systematic review and comprehensive update on spinal CE to help them deal with the often very complex clinical management of these patients. By systematically reviewing all published case reports and case series of spinal CE from 1965 until now, we summarized and analyzed the existing data on treatment, follow-up, and outcome of the disease and discuss the findings in light of the existing data.
