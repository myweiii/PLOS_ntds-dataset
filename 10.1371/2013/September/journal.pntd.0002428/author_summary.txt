Schistosomiasis is a disease affecting more than 200 million people in tropical and sub-tropical countries caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma. The current reliance on a single drug, Praziquantel, for the treatment and control of the disease renders urgent the development of new therapeutic agents. The strategy that we have chosen is to target the enzymes that carry out epigenetic modifications of the chromatin in the parasite and in particular the histone deacetylases (HDACs). Inhibitors of HDACs have been developed as drugs against cancer and our aim is to exploit structural differences in the catalytic domains of the schistosome enzymes in order to develop selective inhibitors that will be drug precursors. Sirtuins are histone deacetylases that have an NAD+-dependent catalytic mechanism. In this study we have characterized all the Schistosoma mansoni sirtuins and show that they are expressed throughout the parasite life-cycle. Sirtuin inhibitors cause the death of schistosome larvae, the separation of adult worm pairs and tissue damage to the worm reproductive organs. These results demonstrate the validity of S. mansoni sirtuins as therapeutic targets.
