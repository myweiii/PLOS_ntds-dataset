Schistosomiasis is caused by a parasitic blood fluke, and in parts of Asia it infects both humans and livestock such as water buffaloes. This makes controlling the disease more difficult, because both humans and livestock must be treated regularly. A vaccine given to buffaloes is likely to reduce human infection rates and improve buffalo health by providing long-lasting protection from re-infection; at present no vaccines are available. Older buffaloes are known to have some immunity to schistosomiasis which is acquired over time; however how this occurs is not understood. In this study we investigated the immune response of buffalo against the schistosome larvae, which are vulnerable to immune attack, and hence are the ideal stage to target for vaccination. We found that the buffalo produces a profound allergic type-2 response as larvae penetrate the skin, with significant cellular infiltrates and abscesses. When the larvae move next to the lungs, a uniquely type-1 response was induced. This skin response is much greater than more susceptible animals such as mice, and may be a mechanism for larval killing in the buffalo. This study offers insight into the immunobiology of an important host for schistosomiasis and may help in designing better vaccines.
