If HIV-infected patients present with seizures, focal neurological symptoms or confusion, a CT-scan or MRI of the brain is normally made. If mass lesions are found (and the CD4 cell count is sufficiently low), cerebral toxoplasmosis is suspected, and often treated empirically. However, some of the symptoms of cerebral toxoplasmosis may mimic those of subacute meningitis. Therefore, in settings where no cerebral imaging can be performed, HIV-associated cerebral toxoplasmosis may be under-diagnosed. We retrospectively looked for toxoplasmosis in a cohort of HIV-infected patients presenting with subacute meningitis in an Indonesian hospital, where neuroradiology was not available for most patients. Patients mostly came with newly diagnosed and advanced HIV infection and few were on HIV-treatment or PJP-prophylaxis. Molecular testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for Toxoplasma gondii in 32% of patients, serology was positive in 78%. Clinically, in the absence of neuroradiology, toxoplasmosis was difficult to distinguish from tuberculosis or cryptococcal meningitis. A positive CSF T. gondii PCR was associated with a two-fold increased mortality. We conclude that toxoplasmosis should be considered in HIV-infected patients with clinically suspected subacute meningitis in settings where neuroradiology is not available.
