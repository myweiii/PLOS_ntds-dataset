Schistosomiasis is a chronic, debilitating disease that affects hundreds of millions of people. The treatment of schistosomiasis relies solely on monotherapy with praziquantel and there is concern that drug-resistant parasites will evolve. Therefore, it is imperative to identify new drugs for schistosomiasis treatment. In this study our goal was to characterize the function of the phytochelatin synthase of Schistosoma mansoni, previously suggested as a candidate for drug targeting to control schistosomiasis. Phytochelatin synthase catalyzes the production of metal chelating peptides, the phytochelatins, from glutathione (GSH). In plants, algae, and fungi phytochelatin production is important for metal tolerance and detoxification. PCS proteins also function in the elimination of xenobiotics by processing GSH S-conjugates. We found that SmPCS expressed in bacteria could both synthesize phytochelatins and hydrolyze various GSH S-conjugates. We found the enzyme works through a thiol-dependant and, notably, metal-independent mechanism for both transpeptidase (phytochelatin synthesis) and peptidase (hydrolysis of GSH S-conjugates) activities. The expression of the PCS gene in adult schistosome worms was increased by exposure to a number of metals and xenobiotics. In addition, these treatments were found to increase the expression of other enzymes involved in GSH metabolism. Highest levels of PCS transcripts were localized in the esophageal gland of adult worms. Taken together, these results suggest that S. mansoni PCS participates in both metal homoeostasis and xenobiotic metabolism rather than metal detoxification as previously suggested and that it may be part of a global stress response in the worm.
