Campylobacter is a common cause of diarrheal disease among children at risk for growth failure in the developing world. We evaluated risk factors for Campylobacter infection as well as the association between symptomatic and asymptomatic Campylobacter infections and child growth over three and nine-month periods. Undernourished (stunted) children were more likely to experience a Campylobacter infection, but adjusting for a recent history of diarrheal disease attenuated this relationship. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections were associated with poorer weight gain and symptomatic Campylobacter infections were marginally associated with poorer linear growth on an order similar to what has been reported for other bacterial pathogens and less than what has been reported for some protozoal and parasitic infections. In a subset of severe infections that made up about twenty percent of total illnesses, the associations were poorer growth were of greater magnitude. Campylobacter infections are frequently viewed as benign, but our study suggests that this is not always the case. Rapid diagnostics for Campylobacter jejuni and coli could attenuate acquired linear growth deficits in populations where campylobacteriosis is highly endemic by facilitating improved case management.
