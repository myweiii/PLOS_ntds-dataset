Leprosy is an infectious disease with a strong host genetic component. The identification of host genetic lesions predisposing to disease is a powerful approach for mapping key junctions in the host pathogen interplay. Genetic variants located in the promoter region of the PARK2 gene are replicated leprosy susceptibility factors. To better understand a possible contribution of PARK2 to host effector mechanisms in leprosy patients, we developed a cellular model to test the contribution of the PARK2 encoded parkin protein to host responses to mycobacterial antigens. We observed that parkin was a mediator of IL-6 production in response to mycobacterial antigen in both THP-1 macrophages and human Schwann cells while human monocyte-derived macrophages needed to be pre-activated with VitD to show the same impact. Parkin also impacted on the constitutive production of MCP-1. The regulatory activity of parkin on cytokine production was found to be independent of the canonical TLR-NFÎºB signalling pathway. We also tested association of IL6 and CCL2 gene expression levels in whole blood assays with PARK2 polymorphisms. For both cytokines, we found significant associations with those PARK2 variants that were established leprosy susceptibility factors. Hence, our results show that genetic PARK2 variants that are correlated with leprosy susceptibility are also correlated with production of these cytokines following stimulation with M. leprae sonicate.
