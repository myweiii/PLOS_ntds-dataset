Schistosome blood flukes are formidable parasites. They can survive for many years as male-female pairs in the blood vessels of their vertebrate hosts where they copulate and produce large numbers of eggs that become lodged in tissues causing schistosomiasis. Over 200 million people are infected with schistosomes, mainly in tropical and sub-tropical countries; in terms of parasitic diseases, the socio-economic impact of human schistosomiasis is second only to malaria. Understanding how cellular mechanisms regulate schistosome form and function is a vital part of global research efforts on schistosomes, not least because identification of novel mechanisms might yield opportunities to develop new drugs against the parasite. Here we use a novel approach to provide a comprehensive atlas that displays the localization of an important protein (protein kinase A) when in an exclusively activated state within schistosomes. We show that this protein is activated within various tissues including those of the musculature and nervous system and that its activation in nerves visibly increases when paired adult male and female schistosomes separate. We also show that PKA plays a vital role in the co-coordination of schistosome muscular activity. Our findings offer valuable insight into this protein at the functional level and provide a much-needed physiological framework for further work on PKA in schistosomes, which has been highlighted previously as a potential drug target.
