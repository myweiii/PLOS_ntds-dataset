Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected, emerging disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. BU usually starts as a nodule, papule, plaque, or oedema. When left alone, the lesion breaks open and a typical painless ulcer with undermined edges appears which can progress to a large necrotic lesion. BU is treated with antibiotics (streptomycin and rifampicin) and surgery if necessary. Apart from these two antibiotics, patients frequently receive other antibiotics during treatment. In files from patients treated in Benin and Ghana we found that in admitted patients a median of two antibiotic courses were prescribed. Only twelve patients received antibiotics for a suspected secondary infection, all other courses were prescribed as prophylaxis of secondary infection extended till 10 days on average after excision, debridement or skin grafting. In another patient group in Benin, superficial wound swabs from Buruli ulcers were performed and showed a high rate of MRSA. We propose a guideline for rational antibiotic treatment for suspected secondary infections or prophylaxis. Adherence to the proposed guideline will have a major impact on antibiotic use other than streptomycin and rifampicin in Buruli ulcer patients, saving costs, toxicity and development of antimicrobial resistance.
