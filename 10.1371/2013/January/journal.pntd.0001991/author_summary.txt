Leptospirosis is a neglected tropical disease and a public health concern worldwide. Factors responsible for the progression towards severe forms have not been clearly established. However, pathogen- as well as host-related factors are both believed to play a role in the development of severe leptospirosis. This study aimed to determine risk and prognostic factors independently associated with severe leptospirosis in laboratory-confirmed cases in adults in New Caledonia. Our study provides important results on these factors. One major finding was the independent association between the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae and severe leptospirosis in the multivariate analysis. Though empirically recognized, we think that this association between this highly prevalent serogroup and most severe forms of the disease was seldom (if ever) clearly demonstrated. Our data also illustrate the benefit of using a critical threshold of qPCR-determined leptospiremia to assess the risk of developing severe leptospirosis in patients after their admission to hospital.
