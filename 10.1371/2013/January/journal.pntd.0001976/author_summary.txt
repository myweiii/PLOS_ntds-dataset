Very little work has been performed on Trypanosoma vivax for decades, but the recent development of murine infection models and axenic cultures has enabled the genetic manipulation of this parasite and has opened the door to a more in-depth understanding of its biology and the infectious process that leads to animal trypanosomosis. We report herein the characterization of a luciferase-expressing strain that can be used to follow parasite dynamics in vivo in real time using a non-invasive method. Regardless of the inoculation parasite route and some minor differences concerning the length of the prepatent period of infection following the subcutaneous injection of the parasites, we highlight the general commitment of the organs triggered by the infection and particularly the presence of the parasite in the brain at late phases of disease. The study presented herein provides new insights into the interaction between T. vivax and its mammalian host and assesses new tools for in vivo drug screening.
