In Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, there is an acute onset from which most of the individuals recover if a competent immune response develops. Patients can remain asymptomatic (indeterminate) for many years, but near 30% can develop specific organ damage, mainly the heart. The pathogenesis of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is associated with parasite persistence, inadequate immune response and autoimmunity. Here we explored the bulk T cells response of chronic chagasic patients with and without cardiomyopathy, uninfected controls and patients with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy. T cells from chagasic donors expressed higher levels of activation markers, and their co-expression on CD4+ T cells distinguished those donors with or without cardiac damage. Mitogen-induced proliferation is highly impaired in the CD8+ T cells compartment, and interestingly activated CD8+ T cells are negatively correlated with the CD4+/CD28− population. The expression of the CD3ζ chain and CD28 was also diminished in chagasic patients. Furthermore, in vitro studies with blood mononuclear cells from uninfected donors showed that the indirect contact with live parasite decreased expression of CD3ζ chain and altered the T cell mitogen-induced proliferation. These results suggest a global impairment of the peripheral T cells response, which is probably associated with parasite persistence.
