Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection that can occur in any place of the world. It is not easy to diagnose because the conventional tests are not good enough, especially in individuals that do not present any symptoms of the disease. This is of particular importance in immunocompromised patients, because the disease can spread causing a disseminated disease which can be fatal. In this study, authors review both conventional and novel techniques for the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. Parasitological examinations based on the detection of the parasite in faeces are the most common techniques used until now in the majority of laboratories. However, they have some disadvantages because most of the best techniques are cumbersome and time consuming and several stool samples have to be collected to improve the diagnosis. New techniques such as the serology which is performed through a blood test are becoming available, but they have still some problems; the test sometimes does not accurately differentiate strongyloidiasis from other helminthic diseases. Another major problem in this disease is to evaluate if patient is cured after the treatment. Parasitological methods can fail to detect treatment failure, and serology has not yet been well evaluated in this context.
