Enzootic transmission of arboviral diseases such as Rift Valley Fever (RVF) continues to occur at a low intensity among mosquito vectors in Kenya, which may remain undetected by most monitoring programs unless very sensitive tools are employed to detect virus activity before an outbreak occurs. Here, we report a more sensitive and mosquito-specific surveillance trapping system for RVF virus (RVFV) mosquito vectors based on mammalian-skin derived semiochemicals. We show that RVFV mosquito vectors detect similar components (heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal) in the skin of RVFV mammalian hosts. In field trials, each of these compounds when combined with CO2 increased captures of these mosquito vectors in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, a blend formulated from optimal attractive dose of each of these compounds combined with CO2 significantly increased trap captures compared to control traps baited with CO2 alone. The four-component blend attracted multiple mosquito vectors of the disease under field conditions suggesting that a trapping system based on this formulation offers opportunity for its use as a tool for RVFV vector surveillance.
