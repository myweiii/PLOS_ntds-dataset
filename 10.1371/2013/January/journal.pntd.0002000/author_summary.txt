Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in several Latin American countries and still represents a major neglected tropical threat. It is transmitted to humans by blood-sucking triatomine bugs, congenital transmission, blood transfusion, organ transplantation and by consuming food and juice contaminated with the parasite. Tools for accurate diagnosis and surrogate markers of parasitological response to treatment remain key needs in the field. This study focused on the evaluation of a novel quantitative PCR assay for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with Chagas disease, on the basis of international guidelines for analytical validation of molecular diagnostic methods. The method allows the simultaneous amplification of parasite satellite DNA sequence and a heterologous internal amplification control that permits rule out false negative results due to inhibitory substances or loss of DNA during sample processing. It was evaluated in peripheral blood samples from acute and chronic patients as well as in umbilical cord blood samples from newborns to seropositive mothers. The performing characteristics of this assay position it as a promising candidate for application to clinical trials and kit developments.
