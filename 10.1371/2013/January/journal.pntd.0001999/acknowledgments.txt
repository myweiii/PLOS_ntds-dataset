We are indebted to the populations of Dielmo and Ndiop for their active participation and for their continuing collaboration in the project; to the nurses, technicians and field workers who were involved in data collection and laboratory tests, especially Mrs. Aliou Diallo and Khadim Leye, who work in the POC, and to Marielle Bedotto who is responsible for the lyophilization of qPCR mixes in Marseilles.
