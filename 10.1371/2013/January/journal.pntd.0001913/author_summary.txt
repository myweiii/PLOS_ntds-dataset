Knowledge about population structure of Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.), the main vector of dengue virus, is vital in designing dengue suppression programs. To design a release of dengue resistant mosquitoes, we require information about population structure at a range of spatial scales. This study looked at a small-scale complex of five villages at four sampling periods and mosquitoes from individual houses within the five villages. Genetic markers were used to screen the field-collected mosquitoes in order to characterize population genetic structure. Our results indicated that the effective population size of Ae. aegypti in each village was low. Genetic structure was apparent at local spatial scales, but there was no evidence of genetic isolation by geographic distance. The temporary genetic structure observed may be caused by related individuals emerging from a few productive containers in each village. Our findings could be applied in an effective dengue suppression program by planning multiple releases of dengue resistant mosquitoes in targeted households of each village where large numbers of adult mosquitoes have emerged from identified productive breeding containers instead of making a release in one area and expecting rapid spread throughout the complex.
