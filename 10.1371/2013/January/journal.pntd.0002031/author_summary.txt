HASPB belongs to a hydrophilic repeat-containing surface antigen family found in Leishmania. The L. infantum/L. donovani protein has been used for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis, and is a putative vaccine candidate for this disease. Visceral leishmaniasis is a fatal disease, and approximately one third of the cases are found in East Africa. The k26 â€“ PCR, which amplifies the repeat region of HASPB, produced different amplicon sizes for recent Ethiopian L. donovani depending on the strain's geographic origin. Further analysis showed that the number and order of the peptide motifs, either 13 or 14 amino acids long, comprising the L. donovani repeats varies between endemic regions of East Africa. Polymorphism in the amino acid sequence of the peptides was also observed. In addition, the 13 amino acid peptide motifs prevalent in L. donovani are rare in L. infantum. The observed polymorphisms in the HASPB repeat region suggests that custom antigens may be needed for diagnosis or vaccination in distinct endemic foci.
