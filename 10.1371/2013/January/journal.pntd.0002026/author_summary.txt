The simian parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is a common cause of malaria in Malaysian Borneo; however, little is known about its emergence over time, particularly in Sabah. We reviewed all available Sabah Department of health malaria notification records from 1992–2011, and considered notifications of P. malariae and P. knowlesi as a single group due to their microscopic similarity. We found that malaria notifications in Sabah have decreased dramatically, with P. falciparum and P. vivax notifications peaking at 33,153 and 15,877 respectively during 1994–1995, and falling to 605 and 628 respectively in 2011. Notifications of P. malariae/P. knowlesi fell from a peak of 614 in 1994 to ≈100/year in the late 1990s/early 2000s, however increased >10-fold between 2004 (n = 59) and 2011 (n = 703). In 1992 P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae/P. knowlesi monoinfections accounted for 70%, 24% and 1% respectively of malaria notifications, compared to 30%, 31% and 35% in 2011. The increase in P. malariae/P. knowlesi notifications occurred state-wide, appearing to have begun in the southwest and progressed north-easterly. This significant recent increase in P. knowlesi notifications following reduced transmission of the human Plasmodium species threatens malaria elimination; further research is required to determine transmission dynamics and risk factors for knowlesi malaria.
