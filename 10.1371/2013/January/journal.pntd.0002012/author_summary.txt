The multitarget approach can represent a promising strategy for the discovery of innovative drug candidates against neglected tropical diseases. However, multitarget drug discovery can be very demanding, because of the highly time-consuming step related to the fine balancing of the biological activities against selected targets. An innovative workflow for discovering multitarget drugs can be envisioned: i) design and synthesis of natural-like compounds; ii) test them using phenotypic cell-based assays; iii) fishing potential targets by means of chemical proteomics. This workflow might rapidly provide new hit candidates that can be further progressed to the hit-to-lead and lead optimization steps of the drug discovery process. The two latter steps can benefit from information on the molecular target(s), which may be identified by chemical proteomics. Herein, we report on the elucidation of the mode of action of a new series of anti-trypanosomal naphthoquinone compounds, previously tested using cell-based assays, by means of chemical proteomics, classical biochemistry, molecular and system biology.
