The highly focal nature of schistosomiasis means that treatment is most cost-effective when delivered on a school-by-school basis. Questionnaires of reported blood in urine (BIU) distributed through the existing school system are a rapid, valid method to classify schools according to WHO treatment thresholds. Their usefulness, however, can be hampered by incomplete return rates that impede treatment decisions in schools with missing questionnaire data. Using data from coastal Kenya, this study describes the use of Bayesian spatial modeling that combines questionnaire data with available parasitological data to make predictions of S. haematobium infection prevalence at all schools. Results showed that reported BIU was highly focal and was negatively associated with the distance to the nearest river. The final model was able to discriminate between schools that require treatment or not, but was less reliable at distinguishing between medium and high prevalence schools. Similar Bayesian spatial models may prove useful for modeling and predicting other diseases where multiple diagnostic techniques are employed.
