Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is a severe and often-fatal disease caused by infection with Junín virus (JUNV). Presently, there is an unmet need to develop new therapeutics to address current medical, public health and national security concerns, as JUNV is considered a potential bioterror agent amenable to aerosolization and intentional release. In the present study, favirpiravir, a promising anti-JUNV drug in clinical development for the treatment of influenza, was evaluated in an experimental small animal model of AHF. Guinea pigs challenged with JUNV were treated with favipiravir twice daily for two weeks starting 1–2 days after infection. Consistent with pharmacokinetic analysis that showed greater plasma levels of favipiravir in animals dosed by intraperitoneal injection, administration by this route resulted in a dramatic protective effect as 78% animals survived the infection compared to 11% in the placebo-treated group. Favipiravir treatment inhibited JUNV replication and prevented the development of disease observed in animals receiving placebo during the acute stage of infection. The high level efficacy observed following post-exposure prophylaxis with favipiravir is the highest ever reported for a small molecule antiviral in the guinea pig JUNV challenge model and thus supports its continued development as a promising antiviral therapy for the treatment of AHF.
