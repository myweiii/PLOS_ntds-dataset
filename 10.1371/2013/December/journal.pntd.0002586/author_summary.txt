The impact of six annual rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) using DEC combined with albendazole on brugian filariasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) was evaluated. Microfilaria rates of B. timori dropped quickly after MDA and were below 1% for 34 months after stopping intervention when the study ended. The prevalence of filarial-specific IgG4 antibodies in the community as measured by the Brugia Rapid test was about 80% before MDA and dropped slowly to about 6% at the end of the study period. MDA had also a beneficial effect on STH, especially on hookworm, but prevalence rates rebounded 34 months after cessation of MDA and quickly approached pre-control levels, while infection intensity was still reduced. Our study indicated that B. timori infection can be eliminated by DEC/albendazole MDA and that the anti-filarial IgG4 rate in the community significantly declines over time. While lymphatic filariasis (LF) MDA can be considered as a powerful general deworming campaign, STH infection rates rebound quickly and a supplementary control strategy is needed after LF MDA is ceased.
