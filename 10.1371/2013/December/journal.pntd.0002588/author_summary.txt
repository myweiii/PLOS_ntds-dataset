Ascaris lumbricoides is the most common intestinal parasite in humans. A. suum is closely related to A. lumbricoides but infects pigs and can be used to study the immune response against larval stages. Most larvae are eliminated from the small intestine between 14 and 21 days after infection in what is called a self-cure reaction. The remaining larvae after this point will be able to grow into adults and reproduce. We show here that the intestinal self-cure of A. suum is locally triggered as part of an innate immune defense mechanism. When pigs received lung stage larvae, they were still able to eliminate the parasite, indicating that passage through the liver or lungs is not essential to eliminate the larvae upon their return in the small intestine. We could identify a decrease in the intestinal transit time at 17 days post infection, indicating an increase in gut movement, which could explain why the worms were being driven out at this time.
