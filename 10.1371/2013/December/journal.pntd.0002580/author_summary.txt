Infections with four different dengue viruses are threatening 2.5 billion people in tropical countries. Since most antibodies to these four viruses are cross-reacting, a type-specific ELISA would be valuable to study the immune response to the circulating viruses in patients but also in healthy subjects in endemic counties. Therefore a novel DENV immune complex binding (ICB) ELISA was developed to detect serotype-specific antibodies to all four dengue virus serotypes in human serum samples. The tests use labeled recombinant EDIII antigens of the four DENV strains. Numerous samples of patients with RT-PCR confirmed dengue fever were assessed by the new method. In samples of 55 patients with primary dengue fever full agreement between the serotype detected by RT-PCR and the serotype-specific antibody based on the ICB ELISA was obtained. The type-specific antibodies were not observed before the second week of illness. Our data suggest that using the ICB ELISA in healthy adult subjects in an endemic region (Vietnam) both primary and secondary infections can be identified. The method may help to analyze the distribution of the four dengue viruses in the tropics.
