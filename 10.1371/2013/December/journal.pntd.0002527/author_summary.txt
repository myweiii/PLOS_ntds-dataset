Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is the most fatal form in Indian subcontinent. Till last few years, the treatment of the disease was done with Sodium antimony gluconate (SAG), the first line drug against VL. This, however, was severely eroded by the resistance developed by the parasite against it. In order to understand the underlying mechanism, earlier a proteomic analysis of SAG sensitive as well as SAG resistant isolates of L.donovani (Ld) was done in which 60s ribosomal L23a (Ld60sRL23a) protein, one of the essential member of translational machinery, was found to be over-expressed. To examine its role in SAG resistance mechanism, which is hitherto not known, 60sRL23a was characterized and over-expressed in the sensitive isolate of L.donovani. The sensitivity of these transfectants, was found to be decreased towards SAG. The growth curve of transfectants clearly showed its proliferation potential in both promastigote and amastigote forms. Cell cycle analysis of the transfectants further assured its rapid progression towards the G2/M phase. The above studies, thus, indicate that 60s RL23a regulates proliferation of L.donovani parasites and represents a unique strategy to resist SAG. 60sRL23a could be further explored as a potential drug target to strengthen the chemotherapy strategy against L.donovani.
