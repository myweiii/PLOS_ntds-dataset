Onchocerca lupi is a little known arthropod-borne helminth infesting dogs of increasing interest to the scientific community due to the recent demonstration of its zoonotic potential. Nonetheless, knowledge of the biology of this nematode is exiguous. In this study the distribution and periodicity of O. lupi microfilariae was investigated from different body regions in naturally infested dogs. Data indicate that O. lupi microfilariae were more common in the head (i.e., ears and nose) followed by the inter-scapular region than in the remaining part of the dog's body suggesting that these parasites aggregate in these anatomical sites. These regions might be the best sites to collect skin samples for diagnostic purposes. Finally, the periodicity pattern of microfilariae of O. lupi and their concentration in specific body regions is most likely a result of the co-evolution with their as-yet-unknown vector.
