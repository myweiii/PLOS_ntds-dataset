Lassa fever is an acute infection associated with hemorrhagic manifestations and multi-organ failure in West Africa. The etiological agent of Lassa fever is Lassa virus (LASV), a rodent-borne arenavirus, which is maintained in nature and transmitted to humans by the multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis. Despite the ubiquitous nature of the rodent reservoir, LASV-infected animals are most commonly documented in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. These four countries represent the historic endemic region for Lassa fever, although there is increasing evidence of sporadic cases occurring in other West African nations including Mali. To better define the geographic distribution of LASV-infected rodents in Mali, we tested samples from small animals collected at 27 sites across the country. Although M. natalensis was the predominant rodent species in the majority of villages, evidence of LASV infection was exclusively found in southern Mali, where overall nearly 20% of rodents were positive. The full genomic sequence was determined for five isolates and confirmed LASV in Mali is closely related to strain AV. We conclude that there is a risk of human exposure to LASV in villages in southern Mali and Lassa fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis for acutely ill, febrile patients.
