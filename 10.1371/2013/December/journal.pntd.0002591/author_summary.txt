Adaptation of parasites to their environment is governed by the principle of selection. Favourable mutations are fixed in populations while deleterious mutations are progressively eliminated. Here, we aimed to find signatures of selection in two strains of Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of intestinal schistosomiasis. The strains differ in specific characters, in particular in their capacity to infect intermediate host snails. The reason for this is unknown and understanding it could help control the spreading of the disease. Finding footprints of adaptation to different snail hosts would lead to the discovery of genes that are particularly important for the interaction. Since a single parasite does not contain sufficient DNA to be sequenced, we pooled several individuals, sequenced them as a whole analysed them. In the regions under selection we found genes that are indeed linked to the parasitic lifestyle. We also discovered that natural selection led to diversification of genes that are related to proteolysis, the process by which the parasite destroys host tissue. The related proteins are considered good targets for drug development and vaccination. Our results suggest that in natural populations many variants of these genes exist and that they evolve rapidly, which might hamper therapeutic approaches.
