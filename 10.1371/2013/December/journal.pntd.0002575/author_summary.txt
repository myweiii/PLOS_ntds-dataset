Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease affecting approximately 10 million people in the world. As a consequence of migration flows, the disease has also become established in non-endemic countries. Previous studies have demonstrated that Trypanosoma cruzi-specific T cells inversely correlates with the severity of cardiac disease in the chronic phase of the infection, suggesting that the immune system becomes exhausted overtime. To test this hypothesis, the quality and magnitude of T. cruzi-specific T cell responses were measured in T. cruzi-infected children â€“ who are presumed to have shorter-term infections - and compared with long-term T. cruzi-infected adults. The activation status of total T cells in T. cruzi-infected children was also evaluated. T. cruzi-infected children exhibit a more robust, and more highly functional parasite specific T cell responses compared to T. cruzi-infected adults. In spite of a more functional immune profile, T. cruzi-infected children have a heightened state of immune activation. These observations are compatible with the initial hypothesis that T cell responses specific for T. cruzi become exhausted overtime. The impairment in T cell responses might contribute to disease progression in long-term infected subjects.
