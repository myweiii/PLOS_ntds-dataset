Plasmodium vivax is responsible for most malaria cases outside Africa, but is poorly understood, as the parasite is difficult to study in vitro. Genome sequencing studies offer a novel and exciting opportunity to better understand this parasite but, so far, have directly mapped reads onto the reference genome sequence generated from a single P. vivax strain. Here, we use sequence data generated from a field isolate to reconstruct long DNA sequences without relying on the reference genome. Our analyses reveal many P. vivax DNA sequences that are absent from the reference genome and contain 792 predicted genes. One of these novel genes encodes a predicted protein similar to known Plasmodium proteins involved in red blood cell invasion. This new gene is present in all P. vivax strains sequenced so far, except for the strain used to generate the reference genome, and is transcribed in blood-stage parasites. Overall, our analyses show that the catalogue of P. vivax genes was incomplete and that potentially important genes have been missed. We notably identified one putative invasion gene that seems functional and could dramatically change our understanding of the mechanisms determining red blood cell invasion by this important malaria parasite.
