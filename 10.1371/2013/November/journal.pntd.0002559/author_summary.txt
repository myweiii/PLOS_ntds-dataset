Although there is efficient multidrug therapy to cure leprosy, the transmission of M. leprae is still active, leading to 219,000 new cases in 2011. Drug resistant leprosy has been described and may prevent eradication of the disease, notably multidrug resistant defined as resistance to rifampin, dapsone and fluoroquinolones (FQ). Resistance to FQ is due to mutations in DNA gyrase. We used a mouse model to measure the impact of DNA gyrase mutations on in vivo FQ activity. All the FQ tested showed in vivo activity against the mutant tested (A91V mutant in subunit A of DNA gyrase). However, whereas ofloxacin was less active than the control treatment clarithromycin, it appeared that latter generation fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and garenoxacin were as active as clarithromycin. Our results demonstrate that DNA gyrase mutation is not synonymous of total lack of in vivo FQ activity against M. leprae. Therefore, as for M. tuberculosis, in vivo studies are mandatory in order to measure the impact of DNA gyrase mutations on treatment efficacy against M. leprae.
