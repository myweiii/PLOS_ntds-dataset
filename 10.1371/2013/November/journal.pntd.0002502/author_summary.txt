Mycolactone, a polyketide cytotoxic toxin, is the key virulence factor responsible for large skin ulcers in Buruli ulcer. This disease, mainly occurring in humid tropical zones, especially in West African countries, is due to infection by Mycobacterium ulcerans, a slow-growing environmental mycobacterium. The toxin has destructive effects on the skin, soft tissues and bones. In this study, we brought out for the first time that addition of specific carbohydrate to culture medium induces the down-regulation of the toxin. Furthermore, this decrease in toxin production is correlated with the activation of the iron acquisition pathway, especially by siderophore production. These results show that M. ulcerans adapts its metabolism to culture conditions, which probably reflect its adaptation in its natural habitats. This work is the first step in toxin regulation understanding which is a key issue for a better comprehension of Buruli ulcer physiopathology and the identification of putative therapeutic targets.
