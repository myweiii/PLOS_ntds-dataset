Visceral leishmaniasis is a lethal parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies. The largest focus of VL in Ethiopia is located in the lowland region bordering Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of agricultural workers migrate for work every year during the planting and harvest seasons. We conducted two parallel studies in residents and migrants to determine the living conditions and behaviors that put people at higher risk of VL risk. We found that sleeping under an acacia tree at night, indicators of poverty and lower educational status were associated with increased risk in both populations. Sleeping under a bed net was protective. For residents, living in a house with thatch walls and sleeping on the ground increased risk of VL. Among migrants, the risk associated with HIV status was borderline significant and sleeping near dogs was associated with increased risk. Preventive strategies should focus on ways to ensure net usage, especially among migrant workers without fixed shelters. More research is needed to understand migration patterns of seasonal labourers and vector behavior.
