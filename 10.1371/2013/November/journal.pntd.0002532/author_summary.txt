Schistosomiasis is an important infectious disease caused by worm parasites of the genus Schistosoma and directly affects more than 240 million people in 78 tropical and sub-tropical countries but also animals. Pathogenesis is triggered by eggs that are produced by paired females and get trapped in liver and gut causing severe inflammation. While studies have concentrated on the reproductive biology of schistosome females in the past, not much is known about males even though they are indispensable for female sexual development and egg production. Therefore, we studied pairing-dependent processes in S. mansoni males using two independent transcriptomics approaches providing a congruent and most comprehensive data-set on genes being differentially transcribed between pairing-experienced, competent males and pairing-unexperienced, naive males. Besides confirming former studies concerning changes in metabolic processes, our results give new insights into processes leading to male competence indicating among others a potential role of neurotransmitters and TGFβ signal-transduction processes. We especially highlight the follistatin gene SmFst, which codes for an inhibitor of the TGFβ-pathway. SmFst transcription was localized in the testes and found to be down-regulated in pairing-experienced males. This indicates a yet unknown function of pairing on the male gonad and a further role of TGFβ-signaling for schistosome biology.
