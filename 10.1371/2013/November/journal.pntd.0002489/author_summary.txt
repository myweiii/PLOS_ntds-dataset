Malaria results from infection of human red blood cells (RBC) by Plasmodium parasite's merozoite. For Plasmodium vivax the process of RBC invasion has been hypothesized to depend on interactions between the parasite's Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) and human Duffy blood group antigen because Duffy-negative people (most often people of African descent) were shown to be highly resistant to RBC infection and disease. Over the past five years, researchers are reporting with increasing frequency that Duffy-negative individuals are infected with P. vivax. This raises new questions as to how P. vivax infects the RBC when the Duffy blood group antigen is not available. Here we show that the parasite's Duffy binding protein gene has been duplicated in multiple P. vivax strains, especially at high prevalence in Madagascar. The specificity and prevalence of this polymorphism suggest that the parasite genome has responded to the barrier of Duffy negativity through the duplication of the PvDBP gene. Our results indicate that the PvDBP duplication is a recent event and provide novel research avenues to understand alternative pathways for P. vivax RBC invasion.
