Parasites of the Trypanosoma brucei species complex are the causative agents of human African trypanosomiasis. There is an urgent need for new drugs to treat this debilitating and potentially fatal infection, especially in its late stage, when parasites have entered the central nervous system. Factors which hamper drug development include the limitations of the current murine models for stage II disease. In vivo bioluminescence imaging is a non-invasive technique that can be used to monitor infections in real time and is a powerful new approach for studying drug effectiveness. However, application of this imaging technology to trypanosome infections has been restricted because of lack of sensitivity. In this paper, we have taken a major step to resolve this problem. The enhanced sensitivity in infected mice is based on the high level expression in trypanosomes of a “red-shifted” luciferase variant that greatly improves bioluminescence detection in deep tissue. The system which we have developed should be a widely applicable tool for providing new insights into the infection biology of T. brucei.
