St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), a member of the Flavivirus genus, which includes West Nile encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and other medically important viruses, is a cause of encephalitis in humans and animals. SLEV is considered endemic in the Americas, and currently there is no vaccine or specific treatment available for controlling of preventing SLEV-induced encephalitis. In this study we describe the first isolation of SLEV from an adult male horse with neurologic disease, which was further characterized by molecular and serological methods. Phylogenetic analysis of a 903 base pairs amplified sequence from partial Envelope (E) gene region indicated that the isolate from the horse was within the cluster of the VB genotype. In addition, inoculation of the SLEV isolate intracranially in newborn mice resulted in circulatory and neurological changes. This is the first report of isolation of SLEV from a horse with neurological disease in Brazil.
