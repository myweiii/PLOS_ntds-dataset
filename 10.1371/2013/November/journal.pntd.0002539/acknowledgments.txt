Thanks are due to: the staff of the Department of Biology, Mahidol University for helping with logistics, the people of Phibun Mangsahan, Thailand, for their interest in our sampling, and the Natural History Museum (London) for providing access to library facilities. We would also like to thank an anonymous referee for reminding us to consider the negative binomial.
