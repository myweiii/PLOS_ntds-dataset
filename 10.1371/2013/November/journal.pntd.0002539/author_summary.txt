There is much controversy over the effects of water resource development on the transmission of schistosomiasis in the lower Mekong Basin. Impact assessments are urgently required because there are currently 12 such projects planned in the region. The key to understanding the effects of impoundment is the impact on the snail intermediate host, which, in the case of Mekong schistosomiasis, is Neotricula aperta. Surprisingly, we have almost no data on N. aperta population trends nor on the impact of dams. To address this, the present work focused on a population near the Pak-Mun dam in Thailand. The analysis suggested that N. aperta populations were not growing significantly over the study period (1990â€“2011), but that the dam may have affected a spike in population density immediately after its completion. The study also revealed changes in density that were coincident on changes in operation of the dam; suggesting that keeping the dam open might lower snail population densities. This is the first scientific assessment of the impact of the Pak-Mun dam on N. aperta and suggests that dams of this kind may affect snail population density. The study also indicates an urgent need for additional independent observations and continuing regular surveys.
