Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne disease whose factors involved in transmission are poorly understood, especially in more urban and densely populated counties. In Brazil, the increasing occurrence of human VL cases in urban centers is a challenge for the control program. We aimed to identify the risk areas for VL and the risk factors involved in transmission in Belo Horizonte, a large urban area of the Brazil. At the same geographical space, we analyzed human VL cases (n = 412), canine infection and socioeconomic and environmental features. We identified a concentration of high-risk small-areas of human VL cases in the northern part of the city, marked by worse levels of education and income, and higher number of infected dogs per inhabitants. The spatial analysis used is useful for the identification of small-areas with a greater risk of VL and displays operational applicability in the control program in an urban environment with an unequal spatial distribution of the disease. Thus, the frequent monitoring of risk of human VL according to small-areas is important to direct and prioritize the actions of the control program in urban environment, especially in big cities.
