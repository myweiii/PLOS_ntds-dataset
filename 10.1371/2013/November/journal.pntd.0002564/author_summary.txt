The human protozoan parasites Leishmania present the ability of both de novo biosynthesis and uptake of pyrimidines. The pyrimidine pathway is not well understood in these parasites. In the hope to better understand the pyrimidine pathway in Leishmania, five independent L. infantum mutants were selected for resistance to the pyrimidine analogue 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Analysis of the 5-FU mutants by comparative genomic hybridization and whole genome sequencing revealed the amplification of the main target enzyme DHFR-TS, and point mutations in three important metabolic enzymes. Transfection experiments confirmed that these point mutations were responsible for 5-FU resistance. Transport studies also revealed that one resistant mutant was defective for uracil and 5-FU import. Overall, this study provided further insights in pyrimidine metabolism in Leishmania and confirmed that multiple mutations can co-exist and lead to resistance in these protozoa.
