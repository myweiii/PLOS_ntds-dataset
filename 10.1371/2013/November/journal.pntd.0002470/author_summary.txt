It is currently estimated that 90 million people in America are exposed to T. cruzi infection, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Despite the mortality and morbidity, this infection is yet considered a neglected disease, due to the lack of effective, safe, and affordable pharmaceuticals for controlling it. T. cruzi leads to immunosuppression of the T cell compartment and to chronic cardiac inflammation, which seems to be associated with the disruption of thymic homeostasis. Thymus atrophy, characteristic of acute infection, is mainly associated with the loss of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, which in turn is associated with increased corticosterone systemic levels, together with their premature export to the periphery as potential autorreactive cells. Although being deleterious to the thymus, GCs are protective during this infection, for avoiding an exacerbated pro-inflammatory response. Here we demonstrate that the increase of GCs in plasma is related to the impairment of PRL systemic levels. The intrathymic hormonal circuitry is also altered during infection and an imbalance of the cross-talk involving GR and PRL is related with CD4+CD8+ depletion. The partial restoration of PRL levels prevented thymus atrophy of infected mice, thus partially reverting the T. cruzi-induced subversion of the organ, ultimately reestablishing thymus homeostasis.
