    "Background": "Plasmodium vivax is the most geographically widespread human malaria parasite. Cohort studies in Papua New Guinea have identified a rapid onset of immunity against vivax-malaria in children living in highly endemic areas. Although numerous P. vivax merozoite antigens are targets of naturally acquired antibodies, the role of many of these antibodies in protective immunity is yet unknown.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "In a cohort of children aged 1\u20133 years, antibodies to different regions of Merozoite Surface Protein 3\u03b1 (PvMSP3\u03b1) and Merozoite Surface Protein 9 (PvMSP9) were measured and related to prospective risk of P. vivax malaria during 16 months of active follow-up. Overall, there was a low prevalence of antibodies to PvMSP3\u03b1 and PvMSP9 proteins (9\u201365%). Antibodies to the PvMSP3\u03b1 N-terminal, Block I and Block II regions increased significantly with age while antibodies to the PvMSP3\u03b1 Block I and PvMSP9 N-terminal regions were positively associated with concurrent P. vivax infection. Independent of exposure (defined as the number of genetically distinct blood-stage infection acquired over time (molFOB)) and age, antibodies specific to both PvMSP3\u03b1 Block II (adjusted incidence ratio (aIRR)\u200a=\u200a0.59, p\u200a=\u200a0.011) and PvMSP9 N-terminus (aIRR\u200a=\u200a0.68, p\u200a=\u200a0.035) were associated with protection against clinical P. vivax malaria. This protection was most pronounced against high-density infections. For PvMSP3\u03b1 Block II, the effect was stronger with higher levels of antibodies.",
    "Conclusions": "These results indicate that PvMSP3\u03b1 Block II and PvMSP9 N-terminus should be further investigated for their potential as P. vivax vaccine antigens. Controlling for molFOB assures that the observed associations are not confounded by individual differences in exposure."
