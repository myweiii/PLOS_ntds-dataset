Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the infection of the brain with larvae of the pig tapeworm (Taenia solium), which results from the ingestion of, e.g., food or water contaminated with the eggs of this helminth. Seizures and epilepsy are the most often reported clinical manifestations. The diagnosis is based on various clinical, radiological, microbiological, and epidemiological criteria. NCC is treatable and preventable. Knowledge about its contribution to epilepsy in a given region therefore helps to manage and prevent the disease. Our study aimed at investigating the prevalence of and risk factors associated with NCC in southern Rwanda. Additionally, we evaluated a new diagnostic method based on the detection of parasite DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with epilepsy for its usefulness. By applying well-established diagnostic criteria for NCC, we identified 16 definitive and 34 probable NCC cases among 215 people with epilepsy in southern Rwanda. The risk of NCC was higher in those lacking access to safe drinking water. This highlights opportunities for the prevention of NCC, and consequently, epilepsy in this region. Parasite DNA could be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 16% of the NCC patients. Thus, this method might help to identify NCC cases, particularly when radiology cannot be performed easily.
