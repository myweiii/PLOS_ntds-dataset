Syphilis, caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, can progress to affect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause damage in the brain and spinal cord, which is called neurosyphilis. While many affected neurosyphilis patients may not have any symptoms, some of the patients will develop severe symptoms that can be life-threatening. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells functioning in suppression of immune-mediated bacterial clearance and tissue damage. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of syphilis patients without neurological abnormalities, and neurosyphilis patients with or without symptoms. Our results show that neurosyphilis patients had higher Treg percentage in blood than syphilis patients without neurological involvement, suggesting that neurological progression in syphilis patients is associated with an increase in blood Treg numbers. Strikingly, a decrease in Treg percentage and numbers in CSF of symptomatic neurosyphilis patients was observed compared to asymptomatic neurosyphilis patients. These results may implicate reduced CNS Treg response as a factor underlying the development of symptoms in some neurosyphilis patients. Our findings highlight a discordant Treg response in blood and CSF in symptomatic neurosyphilis patients and further underscore the fascinating complexity of immune response in syphilis.
