Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major viruses causing Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease, a highly contagious illness which primarily affects young children in the Asia-Pacific region and can sometimes be fatal. No vaccines or antivirals for Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease are available at this time. We developed an experimental vaccine using inactivated, purified EV71 with an adjuvant to amplify the immune response. When this vaccine was tested in mice and rabbits, they produced large amounts of antibodies that could neutralize the virus. We were reasonably certain that the vaccine would be safe because rabbits given repeated high doses did not develop pathological lesions or clinical symptoms. Based on these results, we proceeded to test the safety of the vaccine in human adults.
