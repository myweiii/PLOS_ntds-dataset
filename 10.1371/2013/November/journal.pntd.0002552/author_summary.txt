Chagas disease, the major tropical human disease in much of Latin America, affects approximately 11 million people. There are 300,000 new cases of Chagas disease and approximately 21,000 deaths, annually. Triatomine vectors, including Rhodnius prolixus, are able to transmit the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of disease. To develop within insects, the flagellates undergo morphological changes, modulating surface molecules to enable interactions with insect tissues such as the perimicrovilar membranes in the midgut which is an essential step for their development and successful transmission to a vertebrate host. The surface of T. cruzi is covered in glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored mucin molecules that determine parasite protection and establishment of a persistent infection in vertebrates. A particular kind of mucin, termed TcSMUG L, is only present at surface of the insect-dwelling stages of protozoan and, according to our results, it is involved in the interaction between T. cruzi and its invertebrate host, determining both the ex vivo adhesion to the insect midgut cells and the in vivo development in the vector. Collectively, our work adds new insight into the relevance of mucin-type glycoconjugates in the infection of insect vectors and points to them as promising targets to develop transmission-blocking strategies for this disease.
