Paracoccidioidomycosis, the most important deep mycosis from Latin America, is acquired by inhalation of fungal spores. The pulmonary infection can remain as a quiescent infection or evolve to overt, life-threatening disease. Immunoprotection is mainly mediated by Th1 lymphocytes secreting IFN- Î³, the most important macrophage activating cytokine. It is well established that the severe forms of infection are associated with elevated production of anti-inflammatory or suppressive cytokines such as IL-10. However, direct approaches investigating the role of this cytokine in pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis were never employed. This led us to investigate the innate and adaptive aspects of immunity in pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis using IL-10-deficient mice in comparison with their IL-10-normal counterparts. We verified that IL-10 absence leads to a regressive disease, resulting in reduced mortality rates of infected mice. This better disease outcome was associated with precocious and enhanced mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity that allow the control of fungal growth without excessive inflammatory reactions and harmful tissue pathology. These evidences on the detrimental effects of IL-10 to pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis suggest that therapeutic measures aimed to control IL-10 production or activity could exert a protective effect to this severe fungal pathology.
