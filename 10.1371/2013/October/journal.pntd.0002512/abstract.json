    "Background": "Cellular immunity is the main defense mechanism in paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most important systemic mycosis in Latin America. Th1 immunity and IFN-\u03b3 activated macrophages are fundamental to immunoprotection that is antagonized by IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Both in human and experimental PCM, several evidences indicate that the suppressive effect of IL-10 causes detrimental effects to infected hosts. Because direct studies have not been performed, this study was aimed to characterize the function of IL-10 in pulmonary PCM.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "Wild type (WT) and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice were used to characterize the role of IL-10 in the innate and adaptive immunity against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb) infection. We verified that Pb-infected peritoneal macrophages from IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice presented higher phagocytic and fungicidal activities than WT macrophages, and these activities were associated with elevated production of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, nitric oxide (NO) and MCP-1. For in vivo studies, IL-10\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice were i.t. infected with 1\u00d7106 Pb yeasts and studied at several post-infection periods. Compared to WT mice, IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice showed increased resistance to P. brasiliensis infection as determined by the progressive control of pulmonary fungal loads and total clearance of fungal cells from dissemination organs. This behavior was accompanied by enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, precocious humoral immunity and controlled tissue pathology resulting in increased survival times. In addition, IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice developed precocious T cell immunity mediated by increased numbers of lung infiltrating effector/memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The inflammatory reactions and the production of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines were reduced at late phases of infection, paralleling the regressive infection of IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Our work demonstrates for the first time that IL-10 plays a detrimental effect to pulmonary PCM due to its suppressive effect on the innate and adaptive immunity resulting in progressive infection and precocious mortality of infected hosts."
