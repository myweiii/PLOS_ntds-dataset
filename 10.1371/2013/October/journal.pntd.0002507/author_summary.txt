Biodiversity affects the long-term health of a community by virtue of the many interactions constituent organisms depend upon. Mosquito-borne diseases are particularly likely to respond to changes on multiple transmission levels that span mosquito and vertebrate host communities. We characterized mosquito communities across habitats with differing levels of anthropogenic degradation in central Thailand. During the 2008 rainy season, 83,325 adult mosquitoes were collected from 24 sites, representing 6 habitat types ranging from forest to urban, of which 62,126 females were assigned to 109 taxa. Extrapolated estimates of true richness (Chao1 and ACE) indicated higher diversity of mosquito communities in forest/fragmented forests and lower diversity in urban habitats. Species of medical importance differed significantly across habitats and were always lowest in forest. The relative abundance of vectors Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus was negatively correlated with biodiversity, suggesting that direct species interactions and/or habitat-mediated factors differentially affecting invasive vectors may be important mechanisms linking biodiversity loss to human health. Our results represent an important first step towards understanding the distributions of mosquitoes including disease vectors under changing environmental features.
