Giardia infection, a neglected infection caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis is prevalent worldwide especially among young children in rural areas of the tropics and subtropics. In Malaysia, Giardia infection and protein-energy malnutrition coexist in Aboriginal (Orang Asli) communities with high prevalence among school-aged children. We screened 374 schoolchildren in Lipis and Raub districts, Pahang, Malaysia for the presence of Giardia infection and investigated the effects of this infection on the growth of children. Overall, 22.2% of the children studied were infected with Giardia. Nutritional status of children was assessed and we found that the prevalence of severe underweight, stunting and wasting were 28.3%, 23.8% and 21.0%, respectively. Giardia infection was identified as a significant determinant of weight among these children. Moreover, it was found that Giardia infection has a significant association with the weight of children but not with height. The control of Giardia infection should be given prominence as it is one of the strategies to enhance the nutritional status of Aboriginal children.
