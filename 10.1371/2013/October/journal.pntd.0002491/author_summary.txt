In Iran, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a widespread and highly endemic disease in young individuals. To date, treatment strategy is based on chemotherapy accompanied with high incidence of toxicity and drug resistance. Distinctive mode of action of defensins (members of antimicrobial peptides) with low susceptibility to resistance and low toxicity to mammalian cells makes them suitable candidates for anti-leishmanial agents. The most active human defensin is human neutrophil peptide-1 (HNP-1) produced by neutrophils; the first effector cells during Leishmania infection. In this work, we used recombinant HNP-1 (rHNP-1) against both the promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania (L.) major. Furthermore, immunomodulatory effect of rHNP-1 on Leishmania-infected neutrophils was investigated. Our result showed that rHNP-1 has anti-parasitic effect against L. major promastigotes and amastigotes and also reduces infectivity rate of Leishmania-infected neutrophils. Moreover, assessment of cytokine production from Leishmania-infected neutrophils reveals an increase in TNF-α and a decrease in TGF-β production after rHNP-1 treatment; a cytokine pattern anticipated to facilitate control of parasites. The immunomodulatory effect of rHNP-1 on cytokine production from parasite-infected neutrophils besides its direct effect on free parasites is considered as promising step towards developing new anti-leishmanial agents.
