Serological tests are preferentially used for the diagnosis of Chagas disease during the chronic phase because of the low parasitemia and high anti-T. cruzi antibody titers. However, contradictory or inconclusive results, mainly related to the characteristics of the antigens used, are often observed. Additionally, the factors influencing variation in the clinical forms of Chagas disease have not been elucidated, although it is likely that host and parasite genetics are involved. Several studies attempting to correlate the parasite strain with the clinical forms have used hemoculture and/or PCR-based genotyping. However, both techniques have limitations. Hemoculture requires the isolation of parasites from patient blood and the growth of these parasites in animals or in vitro culture, thereby possibly selecting certain subpopulations. Moreover, the level of parasitemia in the chronic phase is very low, hindering the detection of parasites. Additionally, direct genotyping of parasites from infected tissues is an invasive procedure that requires medical care and hinders studies with a large number of samples. The goal of this work was to identify conserved and polymorphic linear B-cell epitopes of T. cruzi on a genome-wide scale for use in the serodiagnosis and serotyping of Chagas disease using ELISA. Development of a serotyping method based on the detection of strain-specific antibodies may help to understand the relationship between the infecting strain and disease evolution.
