The sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, the most important vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas, is a complex of cryptic species distributed from Argentina to Mexico. There is evidence for the existence of a number of closely related sibling species of this complex in
 Brazil that differ in their male mating songs, sex pheromones and molecular markers. We compared the levels of divergence and gene-flow (introgression) in sympatric and allopatric pairs of sibling species of this complex using several molecular markers. Our results suggest that the L. longipalpis species complex in Brazil has an intricate evolutionary history with a crucial role for introgression, which varies between loci and is asymmetrical between the sibling species. This introgression potentially has important epidemiological implications because it could affect genes that influence the relative role that the different sibling species play as vectors. In addition, our results are particularly relevant considering the potential for increased introgression caused by man-made changes to the environment and the current trend of urbanization of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil.
