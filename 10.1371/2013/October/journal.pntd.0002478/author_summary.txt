Leishmania parasites belong to different species, each one characterized by specific vectors and reservoirs, and causes cutaneous or visceral disease(s) of variable clinical presentation and severity. In its mammalian host, the parasite is an obligate intracellular pathogen infecting the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Leishmania have developed ambiguous relationships with macrophages. Indeed, these cells are the shelter of invading parasites, where they will grow and eventually will reside in a silent state for life. But macrophages are also the cells that participate, through the induction of several pro-inflammatory mediators and antigen presentation, to shape the host immune response and ultimately kill the invader. To subvert these anti-parasite responses, Leishmania manipulate the host machinery for their own differentiation and survival. We aimed to evaluate the impact of L. major (the causative agent of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis) infection on deregulation of non-coding miRNAs, a class of important regulators of gene expression. Our results revealed the implication of several miRNAs on macrophage fate upon parasite infection through regulation of different pathways, including cell death. Our findings provided a new insight for understanding mechanisms governing this miRNA deregulation by parasite infection and will help to provide clues for the development of control strategies for this disease.
