Traditionally misclassified as benign and neglected as a research priority, it is now understood that P. vivax is an increasingly important cause of human malaria. This important human pathogen poses an enormous obstacle to malaria control and elimination efforts due its broad geographic distribution, ability to cause recurring episodes of malaria after long periods of inactivity and extreme biodiversity. Vaccines are an essential component of global malaria control and elimination campaigns but the diversity of malaria antigens is thought to be a major cause of vaccine failure. Furthermore, at present the majority of current vaccine research is directed toward P. falciparum. The aims of this study were to investigate the global diversity of the P. vivax vaccine candidate, Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (PvAMA1), to determine the feasibility of designing a globally effective PvAMA1 vaccine and to determine which region of PvAMA1 is targeted by host immune responses, in order to identify the most promising vaccine candidates. We report that PvAMA1 diversity is extremely high, and that PvAMA1 domain I is a dominant target of host immune responses. These analyses of PvAMA1 diversity from several geographic regions provide a framework to guide development of a broadly efficacious P. vivax vaccine.
