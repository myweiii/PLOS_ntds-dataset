Coauthor Mr. Alphonsus Kal passed away on September 4, 2013. Mr. Kal's contributions to lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis work in Nigeria were significant and his dedication commendable. He will be greatly missed. We thank the staff of The Carter Center's Nigeria offices, the 30 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Plateau and Nasarawa states, the Federal Ministry of Health and the Government of Nigeria. The contribution and participation of the residents and community leaders of the sentinel villages is especially acknowledged. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) provided the donation of albendazole, and Merck & Co. and the Mectizan Donation Program provided ivermectin. LLIN distribution was accomplished with the assistance and active participation of many partners including Clarke Mosquito Company, Centre for Gospel Health and Development (CEGHAD), UNICEF, Yakubu Gowon Centre (YGC), MAPS/USAID, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, WHO and other Roll Back Malaria Partners.
