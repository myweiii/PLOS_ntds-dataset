In Plateau and Nasarawa states in central Nigeria, 4 million persons are threatened by a mosquito-transmitted parasitic disease called lymphatic filariasis (LF). LF can lead to elephantiasis, a crippling condition in which the limbs and genitals often are grotesquely swollen or enlarged. In communities afflicted by this disease, as many as 10% can be affected with swollen limbs, and 50% of men can suffer from swollen genitals. These conditions have a devastating effect on the quality of life of victims, impacting them not only physically but also emotionally and economically. Through health education and community-delivered mass drug administration (MDA) with donated medicines, the Nigerian Ministry of Health and its Carter Center partners have been trying to stop mosquitoes from transmitting LF. LF transmission, as measured by mosquito dissections, dropped dramatically after 8 years of annual MDA. However, it was not until the malaria program distributed long-lasting insecticidal nets in 2010 that the LF parasite no longer appeared in mosquito dissections. No LF infected mosquito was found over a 24-month long surveillance period following long-lasting insecticidal net distribution. The study concluded that MDA and long-lasting insecticidal nets work together to halt the transmission of LF.
