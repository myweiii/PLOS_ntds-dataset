Rhodesian sleeping sickness is a deadly disease, which is spread by the bite of infected tsetse flies in sub Saharan Africa. Rhodesian sleeping sickness has been spreading into new areas of Uganda over the past 15 years; this has been linked to the movement of infected, untreated livestock (which can carry the disease). Until now, there has been little focus on the impact of environmental factors (e.g. land cover) on the spatial spread of sleeping sickness after its introduction to a new area. This work makes use of Rhodesian sleeping sickness case information from December 1998 to November 2002, from an area of Uganda which was not previously affected by the disease, along with the same number of non-sleeping sickness patients, for comparison. Relationships between Rhodesian sleeping sickness and selected factors, including elevation and land cover, were detected using statistical methods. These relationships changed over time, indicating that the disease spread into more ‘suitable’ areas over time, determined by landscape factors. These results provide a novel insight into the environmental factors that guide the spread of Rhodesian sleeping sickness following its introduction to a new area, and can help us to develop more effective control measures to prevent further spread.
