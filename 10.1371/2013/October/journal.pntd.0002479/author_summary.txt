HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by infection with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 infects 10–20 million people worldwide, and, depending on the region, 0.25–3.8% of infected individuals develop HAM/TSP. As the disease progresses, chronic inflammation damages the spinal cord and lower limb and bladder function gradually decline. In the worst cases, even middle-aged patients can become perpetually bedridden. Today, there are treatments that may alleviate the symptoms to a certain degree, but there is no cure that can halt disease progression, and there are no known biomarkers to indicate the level and speed of disease progression. In this study, we successfully identified three promising candidate biomarkers. We believe that the use of these biomarkers could lead to more accurate prognoses and more prudent, patient-specific treatment plans. We not only hope that these biomarkers are sensitive enough to use as selection criteria for clinical trials, but also that measurements of these biomarkers can be used to accurately evaluate drug effectiveness. In short, the biomarkers we identified have the potential to help more effectively treat current HAM/TSP patients and to pave the way for new drugs to potentially cure future HAM/TSP patients.
