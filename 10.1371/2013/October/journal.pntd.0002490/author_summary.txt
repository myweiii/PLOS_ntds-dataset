Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) constitutes a significant public health problem in all federal states of Brazil. Most cases are caused by parasites of the subgenus Leishmania (Viannia) which can cause a variety of clinical symptoms ranging from single or few lesions, disseminated CL with multiple lesions, to disfiguring forms of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. This study has used a multilocus microsatellite typing approach for exploring the genetic diversity and population structure among 120 strains representing different subgenus L. (Viannia) species and different Brazilian CL foci. Genetic diversity within the subgenus was much higher than expected, especially within L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (V.) shawi, L. (V.) naiffi, and L. (V.) lainsoni which were all from the north of Brazil. These strains could not be assigned to well-defined populations, but presented a rather loosely associated group. Strains of L. (V.) braziliensis isolated along the Atlantic coast of Brazil and strains of L. (V.) guyanensis formed, however, two clearly separated populations exhibiting remarkable levels of sexual exchange. The latter finding is in contrast to previous studies suggesting clonal modes of propagation or inbreeding for natural populations of Leishmania parasites and might explain the genetic heterogeneity and limited population structure for Brazilian strains of subgenus L. (Viannia) observed in this study.
