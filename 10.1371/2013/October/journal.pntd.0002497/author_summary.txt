Although there is an increased recognition of the role of T-cells in both dengue pathogenesis and protection, comprehensive analysis of T-cell activation during dengue infection is hampered by the small repertoire of known human dengue T-cell epitopes. Although dengue serotype 3 (DENV3) is responsible for numerous outbreaks worldwide, most of the known epitopes are from studies of dengue 2 serotype (DENV2). In this study, we identified novel DENV3 T-cell epitopes in HLA transgenic mice that were confirmed by HLA binding assays. A subset of these epitopes activated memory T-cells from subjects who were dengue IgG positive and primed na√Øve T-cells from dengue IgG negative individuals. Notably, some of HLA class II epitopes bearing highly conserved regions common to all four dengue serotypes could bind to multiple HLAs. We postulate that these highly conserved and HLA promiscuous T-helper epitopes can be important components of a dengue tetravalent vaccine.
