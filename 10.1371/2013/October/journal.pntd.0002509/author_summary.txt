The identification of cellular components and metabolic pathways involved in virus replication provides valuable information for the development of new antiviral strategies. Autophagy is one of these metabolic pathways with multiple implications during viral replication. Autophagy literally means self-digestion and constitutes a cellular process by which intracellular components are enclosed by membrane structures and degraded. Interestingly autophagy can contribute either positively or negatively to viral infections. For instance, several viruses hijack these autophagic membranes to build their replication complexes or take advantage on metabolic rearrangements induced following autophagy, while in other cases autophagy contributes to viral clearance and innate immunity. In this study, we explored the possible implication of the autophagic pathway during Usutu virus infection (USUV). USUV is an African mosquito-borne flavivirus that mainly infects mosquitoes and birds, although infections in humans have been also documented, thus warning about USUV as a potential health threat. Our results indicate that infection by USUV of different origins triggers an autophagic response within infected cells. Even more, drugs that target components from the autophagic pathway modulate USUV-infection. These results provide the basis for the design of new antiviral research lines against this pathogen.
