Surgical removal of cysts may be impractical in cases that cysts are in multiple organs or tissues, or in risky locations. In that case, alternative treatment should be employed. Heavy-ion radiation could be an effective way for treatment of hydatid cysts, taking its full advantage of well-defined range, small lateral beam spread and an enhanced biological effectiveness. In this study, we found that carbon-ion radiation could result in extensive mitochondrial DNA damage and apoptosis in hydatid cysts. Cellular and ultrastructural changes were observed after ionizing radiation, which were indicative of cysts growth inhibition. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the biological effect of carbon-ion radiation on E. multilocularis hydatid cysts.
