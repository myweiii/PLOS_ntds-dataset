Enteric fever, which comprises of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, is common in many developing countries. It is also sometimes seen in the Western world in returning travellers. This present study of uncomplicated enteric fever in an outpatient setting in a hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal compared the newer gatifloxacin with the widely-used ofloxacin (two drugs of the fluroquinolone class) in the treatment of this illness. Although fluroquinolones are commonly considered the main group of drugs in the treatment of enteric fever, there have not been comparisons of efficacy between two drugs in this same class in the treatment of enteric fever. Furthermore, certain strains of enteric fever organism called nalidixic-acid resistant strains are proving very difficult to treat in both the local population and the Western travellers. The study focused primarily on the efficacy of the 2 drugs against these particular strains. The results revealed that both drugs were effective but gatifloxacin decreased the patient's fever more rapidly than ofloxacin. Dysglycemia was noted in a 35-year-old woman taking gatifloxacin who did not disclose a pre-existing diagnosis of diabetes at time of enrollment, but not in any other healthy child or young adult.
