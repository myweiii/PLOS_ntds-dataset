In addition to the primary metabolism necessary for life, plants have a secondary metabolism that generates compounds, which aid in their growth and development. A common role of secondary metabolites is defense mechanisms to fight off animals, pest and pathogens. Pharmacognosy takes advantage of the rich source of compounds produced by plants, selecting and processing natural products for medicinal use, resulting in a wide range of anticancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-infective drugs currently in use. Chagas disease and leishmaniasis are parasitic diseases caused by protozoa transmitted by sucking insects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) they are considered as Neglected Tropical Diseases that are especially endemic in low-income populations in developing countries. The drugs currently in use were developed more than 50 years ago and have severe drawbacks. The authors found that chemical compounds called sesquiterpene lactones, obtained from plants of the Asteraceae family, have anti-protozoan activity against different parasite stages. The identified compounds were also able to control parasitic infection in mice without any toxic effects. Thus, these sesquiterpenes lactones could be interesting chemical compounds having pharmacological properties, whose chemical structure could be modified leading to potent and safer drugs to treat these parasitoses.
