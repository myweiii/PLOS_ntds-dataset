Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium usually causes foodborne diarrheal infections in humans. Recently variants of S. Typhimurium have emerged in Africa associated with invasive and often fatal disease, especially in adults infected by HIV and children with malaria or malnutrition. Analysis of these Sequence Type (ST) 313 isolates has identified significant genome degradation, compared with the ST19 genotype that typically causes diarrhea in humans. This is characterised by pseudogenes and deletions observed in the human-adapted S.Typhi. This has led to the hypothesis that the ST313 has become specifically adapted to humans. Here, we show ST313 also cause invasive disease in chickens, a common source of human Salmonella infection. As in humans, ST313 strains are more invasive than ST19 S. Typhimurium, and also cause less intestinal colonization. However, unlike Salmonella serotypes associated with invasive disease in the chicken, ST313 causes inflammation and damage to the intestine. These findings suggest that ST313 is not host-restricted to humans, and may have evolved to cause a more invasive disease in a range of hosts. We highlight the fact that animals, including chickens, could still be a source of ST313 and that further epidemiological research is needed into potential animal reservoirs of ST313 in Africa.
