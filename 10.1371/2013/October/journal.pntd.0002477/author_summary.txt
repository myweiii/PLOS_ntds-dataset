Although pathogenic Leptospira is not an obligate intracellular pathogen, recent studies have shown that phagocytosis and innate immunity play important roles in leptospirosis. The Leptospira-macrophage interaction is a common model used to elucidate the initial response in leptospiral infection. Our previous research has shown that there is little difference in the transcriptomics of pathogenic Leptospira infecting murine or human macrophage cell lines. Contrarily, in this study, we observed significant differences of murine and human primary macrophages infected by L. interrogans as shown in several processes, such as antigen processing and presentation, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and innate immune response, complement and coagulation cascades, expression of major cytokines and chemokines, etc. These results suggested that different immune responses explain the major disparities in the murine and human Leptospira-macrophage infection models. This study added to the former leptospiral transcriptomics research on the Leptospira-macrophage interaction model and laid a foundation for further investigation in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.
