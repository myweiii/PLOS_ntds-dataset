Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis acquired by traumatic inoculation of soil and plant material contaminated with infectious propagules of the pathogen. The transmission of the disease by cats to other animals and humans occurs by biting or scratching, promoting direct inoculation of yeast cells into host tissue. This may represent an alternative and a successful transmission of the fungus. In order to understand the impact of felines on the epidemiology of sporotrichosis, we evaluated the phenotypic and genotypic features of isolates obtained from animals and humans living in outbreak areas. Although sporotrichosis is caused by a complex of species, in this study we observed that S. brasiliensis is the prevalent etiological agent of feline sporotrichosis, having been recovered from 96.9% of the samples. Moreover, this approach allowed us to recognize that isolates from RJ, SP, PR and MG states are genetically similar among them but different from feline isolates recovered from the RS epidemic. Our study brings new insights into the eco-epidemiology of sporotrichosis in Brazil, clarifying the distribution and prevalence of S. brasiliensis in feline outbreaks. Knowledge about the source and distribution of the etiological agent between outbreak areas may help to establish public strategies for the containment of the epidemic of sporotrichosis in Brazil.
