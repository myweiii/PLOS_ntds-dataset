Once they have gained entry to mammals, live Leishmania (L) amazonensis amastigotes are known to subvert both macrophages and dendritic leucocytes (DLs) as host cells. These L. amazonensis amastigotes then may or may not proliferate in these two phagocytic leucocyte lineages, but in both cases the otherwise versatile differentiation program of these lineages is known to be rapidly remodeled. Here, we describe the rapid reprogramming of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mouse bone marrow-derived DLs, with a special focus on cytosolic lipid bodies (LBs) that are known to store neutral lipids such as triacyl-sn-glycerol (TAG) and cholesteryl esters (CE). After extracting RNA from carefully sorted amastigote-free DLs and L. amazonensis amastigote-hosting DLs, an Affymetrix-based analysis clearly showed a singular and coordinated increase in DL transcripts involved in (i) long-chain fatty acid uptake, transport and esterification to TAG and (ii) cholesterol uptake and esterification to cholesteryl esters. Oleic acid was added to check that neutral lipid metabolism was both rapidly increased and reprogrammed in amastigote-hosting DLs. It should be noted that the LBs in live amastigote-hosting DLs were more numerous, and that the largest of these LBs were in contact with live amastigote- hosting parasitophorous vacuoles. We further discuss these findings in the context of live L. amazonensis amastigote-rodent host interactions.
