Aedes polynesiensis is a vector for both dengue and filariasis in the South Pacific. Efforts are ongoing to utilize Wolbachia as a biological control agent targeting this vector through either population suppression via releases of incompatible males or population replacement for spreading disease resistance into a population. Replacing the native Wolbachia with a novel infection from Ae. albopictus has generated the “MTB” strain of Ae. polynesiensis. This MTB mosquito is reproductively-incompatible with the wild type of Ae. polynesiensis and has a low susceptibility for filarial worms. In this work, we show that the MTB mosquito is resistant to dengue virus with a reduced viral infection in the mosquito whole body, midgut, head, and saliva. Our results further show its refractoriness to dengue virus is associated with a dramatic increase in Wolbachia density in those mosquito tissues where dengue virus needs to reside, replicate, and travel in order to be transmitted to humans. These results suggest that the MTB strain has the potential to be used in Wolbachia-based strategies to control both dengue and filariasis in the South Pacific.
