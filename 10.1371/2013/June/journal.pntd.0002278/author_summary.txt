Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasite infection, transmitted to humans by sandflies. It is estimated to cause 1.6 million new cases of disease annually. Of the two main forms, so-called “visceral” and “cutaneous”, the visceral form is fatal in 85–90% of untreated cases. This literature review provides a comprehensive summary of all the available evidence relating to the impact of interventions against infection on the burden of leishmaniasis in people and highlights the absence of high quality evidence demonstrating an effect. Four broad categories of preventative interventions are identified, investigating a range of strategies, from protection of humans against infection, to interventions aimed one stage upstream of human infection (targeting the sandfly vector), and even further, to interventions targeting animal reservoir species. Based on the current lack of understanding of the dynamics of transmission of Leishmania, we conclude that scant resources might be best directed toward prevention of human infections, with a focus on development of a human vaccine.
