Dengue virus infection ranges from a mild febrile illness to severe illness. Severe dengue is mainly characterized by transient plasma leakage, which may lead to a sudden onset of shock around the time of defervescence. Severe bleeding and organ impairment are less common features of severe dengue. In clinical practice it is difficult to predict which dengue patient will develop severe complications. Commonly used laboratory markers indicating plasma leakage—such as hematocrit—are rarely of clinical benefit. In contrast, ultrasonography can directly visualize plasma leakage. Because ultrasonography is not routinely used due to financial and logistical limitations, we used a more affordable handheld ultrasound device for daily bedside follow up, which had similar results as conventional ultrasonography. This study shows that a substantial proportion of mildly ill patients already had small amounts of plasma leakage before severe complications developed and—most importantly—that these patients had an increased risk for progression to shock compared to patients without plasma leakage. We conclude that ultrasonography can help to identify dengue patients at risk for shock and that patients with ultrasonographic evidence of plasma leakage should be monitored more carefully for circulatory status to timely recognize and possibly prevent shock.
