Whereas previous researchers have noted that seasonal peaks in the numbers of houseflies and patients suffering from Shigella diarrheal infection seemed to coincide, this is the first research to quantify the association using time-series statistical methods. The results show that houseflies could account for approximately 37% of all cases of shigellosis in an area in rural Bangladesh. This research adds to the existing published experimental and observational evidence from other parts of the world implicating houseflies as mechanical transmission vectors for Shigella. The results can be used to advocate for cluster-randomized intervention trials that can demonstrate how much control of housefly density can diminish Shigella disease incidence. This question should be answered because there are currently no licensed Shigella vaccines, and rising antibiotic resistance is limiting treatment options. Control of houseflies using methods such as baited fly traps could be an affordable, effective intervention to add to the public health arsenal for routine use and in the context of disaster response.
