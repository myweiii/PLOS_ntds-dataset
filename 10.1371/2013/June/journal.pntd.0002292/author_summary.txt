Every year, 20 million people worldwide suffer from typhoid, a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food and water, and over 200,000 die from the infection. However, few data are available on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles of the causative agents of typhoid, especially in settings without reliable access to laboratories and electricity. Here, we describe an approach that permits recovery of the causative agents of typhoid that requires no electricity, laboratory infrastructure, or specialized laboratory personnel at the site of patient contact. This approach involves the use of an electricity-free incubator, consisting of an insulated container and reusable packets filled with a chemical that upon warming in hot water or direct sun, maintains 38Â°C for 24 hours. We used blood culture bottles with a color indicator that signals growth of bacteria and an antibiotic that selects for Gram-negative bacteria. We validated this approach in a clinical study among individuals with fever presenting to a hospital in urban Nepal, demonstrating that the approach performed comparably to conventional blood culture for isolating the bacteria causing typhoid. Such an approach would permit an estimate of the burden of typhoid in areas where such data are lacking, which could inform control strategies.
