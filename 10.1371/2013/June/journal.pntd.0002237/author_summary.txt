Rift Valley fever is an endemic and epidemic zoonosis in Africa and the Arabic Peninsula. In humans, in the most severe cases the viral infection causes fulminant hepatitis associated with haemorrhagic fever, permanent blindness or severe encephalitis. Despite the importance of vector transmission in the spread of arboviruses, few studies on the physiopathology of viral infection have considered the role of the arthropod in the efficiency of viral infection. Moreover, the route of virus inoculation and the presence of the vector's saliva can potentially affect virus pathogenicity. Our results show that saliva from Aedes mosquitoes increases Rift Valley fever pathogenicity. Importantly, our study also revealed that RVFV transmitted via mosquito bites spread differently than virus inoculated by other routes. These observations may have interesting repercussions given the role mosquitoes were shown to play in the transmission of RVFV in humans during the last outbreak of the disease in Saudi Arabia. Identification of salivary proteins able to increase RVFV virulence may pave the way to new approaches to prevent or cure the disease.
