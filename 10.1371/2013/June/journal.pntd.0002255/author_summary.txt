The mechanisms of genomic and genetic evolution in the Leishmania order, a protozoan group that contains about twenty pathogenic species, are the focus of much debate. Although these parasites have been considered for years to reproduce clonally, recent works have demonstrated both experimental and in natura intra- and inter-specific hybrids. Interspecific exchanges should be sources of plasticity and adaptation to new parasitic cycles. In this work we used a MultiLocus Sequence Analysis approach to analyze 222 Leishmania strains that belong to different species and were isolated in African and Eurasian foci. This analysis classified the different strains in seven robust genetic clusters that showed remarkable congruence of the phylogenetic message between them. From a taxonomic point of view, the seven clusters overlapped with most of the biochemical taxonomic groups currently in use except for species causing visceral forms of leishmaniasis. Contrary to what expected, we did not detect traces of interspecific recombination and genetic exchanges between the different species. Finally, these results should have consequences on the taxonomy, on our understanding of the epidemiology and on the therapeutic management of these infections.
