Cystic echinococcosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus is a widespread zoonotic disease. This cestode parasite is a complex of genetic variants and to date, ten distinct genotypes (genotypes G1â€“G10) have been identified on the basis of mitochondrial DNA sequences. The strain variation in E. granulosus may influence life-cycle patterns, host range, antigenicity and transmission dynamics. The disease is endemic in different parts of India. Although the presence of G1, G2, G3 and G5 has been reported in animal isolates in India, the zoonotic potential of the different genotypes has not been evaluated. In the present study, a genotype analysis was carried out in hydatid cysts collected from 32 cystic echinococcosis patients residing in North India. Most of the CE patients (30/32) were found to be infected with hydatid cyst of either G3 (53.1%) or G1 (40.62%) genotype and one each of G5 (cattle strain) and G6 (camel strain) genotype.
