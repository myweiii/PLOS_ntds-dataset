Cholera is a diarrheal disease causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, colonizes the intestine and induces massive intestinal fluid secretion through actions of its enterotoxins, especially cholera toxin. We have developed a ligated ileal loop model of V. cholerae-induced diarrhea in adult mice, in which inoculation of V. cholerae (107 CFU/loop) consistently caused intestinal fluid secretion in 12 h. Interestingly, administration of CFTRinh-172, a small molecule CFTR inhibitor, completely abolished V. cholerae-induced intestinal fluid secretion, indicating that CFTR plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diarrhea in this model. Furthermore, we demonstrated that intestinal fluid accumulation in this model was neither caused by increased intestinal paracellular permeability nor enhanced vascular leakage. This adult mouse model of V. cholerae-induced diarrhea could be very useful in the studies of pathogenesis of V. cholerae infection-induced diarrhea and in the evaluation of potential therapies/cholera vaccines.
