Onchocerciasis is known as a cause of skin and eye disease infecting a great number of people, mainly in rural Africa. In the endemic areas, infection status and severity is essentially determined by the duration and intensity of exposure to the parasite and to host sex. A link between onchocerciasis and epilepsy has been suggested over a long time but the existence of a definite association is still controversial. Based on a comprehensive literature review of case-control studies on this issue, the authors found a significant association between epilepsy and a positive infection status with Onchocerca volvulus. This relationship was less pronounced when the analysis was restricted to those studies giving evidence of sufficient control for age, endemicity level of the area of residence and sex. When within this restricted sample indicators giving information on infection intensity, namely nodule palpation and microfilarial density in untreated patients, were taken into consideration, again a significant result was found. In their overall constellation these results corroborate the hypothesis that epilepsy in endemic areas is caused by a disease process induced by infection with O. volvulus, especially in patients with severe infection.
