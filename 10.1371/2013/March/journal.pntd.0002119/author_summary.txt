The roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides, the whipworm Trichuris trichiura and the two hookworm species Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus are responsible for the most common infections worldwide and place more than 5 billion people at risk. To control these infections, at risk populations are treated regularly with anthelminthic drugs, mostly albendazole and mebendazole. Since both drugs have a low therapeutic effect against T. trichiura, alternative drugs should be discovered and developed. Possible strategies are to re-evaluate forgotten compounds and to thoroughly study drug combinations. We evaluated the activity of the “old”, veterinary drug oxantel pamoate against T. muris, Ancylostoma ceylanicum and Necator americanus in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we studied the activity of oxantel pamoate combinations with the four standard treatments for soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Our results confirm that oxantel pamoate has excellent trichuricidal properties. We show that the drug lacks activity against hookworms. It is therefore necessary to combine oxantel pamoate with an anti-hookworm drug. Synergistic effects were observed with oxantel pamoate-mebendazole in our study. Additional preclinical studies should be launched with oxantel pamoate-mebendazole as well as oxantel pamoate-albendazole, since albendazole is the most widely used and efficacious anti-hookworm drug.
