In Brazil, the first dengue haemorrhagic cases were reported after the DENV-2 introduction in Rio de Janeiro, which spread to other states in the country. Aiming to perform the molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of DENV-2 during twenty years of viral activity in the country, strains isolated from patients presenting different disease manifestations were sequenced. Phylogeny characterized the DENV-2 as belonging to the Southeast Asian genotype, however a distinction of two Lineages within this genotype has been identified. Furthermore, all strains presented an asparagine in E390, previously identified as a probable genetic marker of virulence. The results show a temporal circulation of genetically different viruses in Brazil, probably due to the introduction of a new viral lineage from the Caribbean, which lead to the re-emergence of this serotype after 2007, causing the most severe epidemic already described in the country.
