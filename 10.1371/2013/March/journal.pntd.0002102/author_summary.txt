Cysticercosis caused by the zoonotic pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, is emerging as a serious public health and agricultural problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Surveys have shown cysticercosis in pigs to be highly prevalent in multiple foci in Tanzania, and a hospital-based study in the northern highlands indicated neurocysticercosis as an important cause of epileptic seizures in humans. We present here a cross-sectional community-based survey on the prevalence and risk factors of human cysticercosis and taeniosis conducted in the southern highlands â€“ the major pig-producing area of the country. The most striking findings were that more than 15% of people surveyed were found to have active cysticercosis and nearly half of them were found to have been exposed to larval T. solium indicating a high level of environmental contamination with T. solium eggs. This was supported by finding over 4% of people having had T. solium tapeworms. A subset of persons found positive serologically for active cysticercosis underwent brain scanning and more than half of them were found to have neurocysticercosis. This strong evidence that T. solium cysticercosis/neurocysticercosis/taeniosis is highly endemic in the southern highlands of Tanzania demands urgent attention of regional and national authorities to combat the parasite.
