For a successful development within the midgut of the sand fly vector, Leishmania must overcome several barriers imposed by the vector that include the digestive proteases secreted within the midgut following a blood meal by the insect, the need to escape from the endoperitrophic space, and attachment to the midgut epithelia to prevent excretion with the remnants of the blood meal. The sand fly peritrophic matrix (PM) constitutes an important barrier against the establishment of Leishmania within the sand fly and if trapped within the PM these parasites will be passed along with the remnants of the blood meal. Despite the role of sand fly PM on Leishmania development, characterization of its molecular components and assessment of their roles against Leishmania are lacking. Thereby, we performed the molecular characterization of three P. papatasi peritrophins named PpPer1, PpPer2, and PpPer3. Overall, we demonstrated that: (1) PpPer3 displays a putative CBD domain that might have undertaken neo-functionalization, (2) PpPer1 and PpPer3 genes display differential gene expression upon Le. major infection; and (3) PpPer1 seems to be an important component for the function of P. papatasi PM as a barrier against Le. major infection.
