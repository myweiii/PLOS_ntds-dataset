Chagas disease is caused by the chronic infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is transmitted to human beings by bloodsucking insects of the Triatoma family. This condition is endemic in Central and South America, and is acquiring relevance in the rest of the world since it can also be transmitted by transfusions or organ transplantation from asymptomatic, infected donors. Detecting infected persons is one of the most important points in public health, mostly because it allows the identification of infected individuals at earlier stages of the disease, where adequate medical surveillance will permit secondary prevention measures to be given to these patients and thus avoidance of disease complications such as cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure. In this study we describe the prevalence of infection in a region of Colombia that was previously considered at risk for the infection because of the presence of infected insect vectors living in housings.
