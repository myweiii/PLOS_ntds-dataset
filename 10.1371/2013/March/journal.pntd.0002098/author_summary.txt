Approximately 1 billion people are infected with one or more helminthes – a class of parasites that can impair physical, mental and economic development. We are interested in whether there exist groups who are repeatedly infected with helminthes over time in areas where treatment is ongoing. Such individuals may be at risk of morbidity and may also serve as parasite reservoirs, making them appropriate targets for disease control programs. We followed two cohorts in rural Sichuan, China in order to evaluate whether the same individuals were repeatedly infected with the water-borne helminth, Schistosoma japonicum. Each participant was tested for infection at enrollment and two follow-up points – all infections were promptly treated. We conducted detailed interviews to assess exposures to S. japonicum. We found infections repeatedly occurred in a subgroup of individuals and this clustering of infections was only partly explained by differences in exposure. This suggests some individuals may be particularly susceptible to S. japonicum infection. Further exploration of the interplay of exposure and susceptibility suggest that as exposure declines, so too does the fraction of the population vulnerable to infection. Helminth control programs that target people with a history of infection may efficiently reduce helminth infections and morbidity.
