Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is one of the most common parasitic diseases of the CNS caused by the metacestode (larva) of the tapeworm Taenia solium. Epidemiological studies show that among the various forms of NCC, subarachnoid NCC is associated with poor prognosis, more resistance to anti-helminthic drugs and more severe inflammation. The chronic inflammation of the vasculature and arachnoid thickening (chronic basal meningitis) leads to blockade of CSF further contributing to CNS pathology. Using a murine model for NCC, we have found that among the different types of vasculature associated with the blood-brain barrier (BBB), pial vessels of BBB are compromised earlier and to a greater extent during NCC. In addition, pial vessels are likely the most important entryway for leukocyte infiltration during NCC. The aim of this study was to characterize infection-induced changes in the genome-wide gene expression of pial vessels. Our approach was to isolate pial vessels of the BBB by in vivo labeling of vessels followed by laser capture microdissection microscopy (LCM). Further, microarray analysis of pial vessels showed infection-induced changes in the expression of genes associated with both immunity and disease, and collectively provides insight into the dysfunction of the BBB and mechanisms associated with leukocyte infiltration during murine NCC.
