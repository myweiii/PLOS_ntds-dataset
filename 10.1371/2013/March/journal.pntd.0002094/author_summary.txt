Schistosomiasis affects over 200 million people and especially children in developing countries. It causes general hyporesponsiveness of the immune system, which until now has predominantly been described for various T cell subsets as well as dendritic cells. B cells in this context have not yet been investigated. To address this question, we phenotyped B cell subsets present in peripheral blood from S. haematobium infected and uninfected schoolchildren living in an endemic area in Lambaréné, Gabon. Children with schistosomiasis had an increased frequency of various memory B cell subsets, including subsets associated with B cell exhaustion, and a concomitant decrease in naive B cells. To study the effect of Schistosoma infection on B cells in more detail we isolated peripheral blood B cells and found that B cells from infected children had a reduced capacity to proliferate and produce TNF-α in response to both B cell receptor and Toll-like receptor stimulation. These results provide new insights into the role of B cells in the host immune response to schistosomiasis and may provide a novel target for therapeutic strategies.
