The strategy to control morbidity due to infection with the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni is to regularly treat school-aged children with the drug praziquantel. Recent studies suggest that in highly endemic areas preschoolers might need to be included in such deworming campaigns. An accurate diagnosis is important to assess how many preschool-aged children need treatment, but the widely used Kato-Katz technique does not detect all infections. We assessed the accuracy of a point-of-care (POC) test that is based on the detection of the fluke's circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in children's urine. We obtained two stool and two urine samples from 242 preschoolers in CÃ´te d'Ivoire before and from 86 of these children after praziquantel treatment. Stool samples were examined with the Kato-Katz technique and urine samples with the POC-CCA test for S. mansoni. The sensitivity of one POC-CCA was much higher than a single Kato-Katz for S. mansoni diagnosis before (69.7% versus 28.3%) and after treatment (80.0% versus 4.0%). The POC-CCA therefore is useful for the rapid identification of S. mansoni-infected preschoolers who need treatment. The application of the POC-CCA test for monitoring of schistosomiasis control interventions needs further investigation.
