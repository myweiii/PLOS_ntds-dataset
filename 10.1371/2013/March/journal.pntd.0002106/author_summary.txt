Because urogenital schistosomiasis is a multi-decadal chronic disease that begins in early childhood, and because it is a disease that may affect nearly everyone in endemic communities, its impact on personal health-related quality of life (HrQoL) has been difficult to gauge accurately. In order to provide a more precise estimate of schistosomiasis' impact on overall health status, we used a standardized questionnaire, the PedsQL SF15 Inventory, to interview children, aged 5–18 years, and their parents, to quantify their reported physical, social, emotional, and scholastic performance status. Scores were significantly lower in villages having high Schistosoma prevalence, as compared those having moderate prevalence. In adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic standing, undernutrition, anemia, and hookworm parasites, we found that relative poverty, stunting, wasting, and S. haematobium infection were significant correlates of HrQoL scores, with differential effects in high- and moderate-prevalence communities. The greatest differences were noted in the psychosocial domains of performance. We conclude that exposure to urogenital schistosomiasis has an overall detrimental effect on HrQoL at a level of 2–4% impairment. New implementation of better diagnostics for children is expected to refine our estimates of this association, as will follow-up studies of HrQoL following effective individual and community deworming.
