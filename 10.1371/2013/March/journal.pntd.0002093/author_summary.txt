Hansen's Disease, or leprosy, is a disease that despite curative therapy is still a health problem in many areas, particularly in Brazil, which has a high new case detection rate. If symptoms of Hansen's disease are not recognized, delay in diagnosis can result in severe disability. Within the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, a state that has had a low detection rate, we focused on a municipality which is considered hyperendemic. We visited households of previously diagnosed Hansen's disease cases and two neighboring households. There was no difference in the rate of detection of new cases within case and neighbor households, nor differences with respect to education, household income, or the number of people living in the residence. By mapping these households, we found that proximity to a multibacillary case increased the risk of finding a new case of Hansen's disease. Spatial analysis in areas with Hansen's disease should be a tool for implementation of active surveillance to help reduce disease transmission. In addition, it is essential to raise awareness in communities at highest risk to promote early detection and treatment of new cases.
