Neurocysticercosis is one of the most frequent parasitic diseases affecting the human central nervous system. The most severe clinical forms occur when parasites are located in the subarachnoid space at the base of the brain. In these instances, cysticidal drug efficacy is reduced and neuroimaging studies are less reliable as diagnostic tools. Previous works highlighted the value of antigen detection by ELISA test to detect viable parasites in these locations. In this prospective study, we evaluate its utility in patient follow-up, comparing its performance with magnetic resonance imaging results. Results from both procedures were also compared retrospectively at each medical appointment considering radiological evolution since last evaluation. Thirty-eight patients were included, with a total of 108 samples collected over 43 months. We demonstrated that antigen detection in these patients is an accurate tool in determining the efficacy of cysticidal treatment. This result is of great potential, considering the difficulty for the patients in endemic countries to access imaging studies and the much lower cost of the assay with respect to magnetic resonance imaging.
