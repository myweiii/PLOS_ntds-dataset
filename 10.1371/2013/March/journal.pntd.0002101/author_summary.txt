Mycobacterium ulcerans infection causes Buruli ulcer (BU), a disfiguring skin disease now found principally in poor rural areas of West Africa. M. ulcerans produces a toxin called mycolactone (ML), which destroys fat cells in skin tissue. BU typically first shows as a nodule that eventually ulcerates. The lesions may continue to spread over limbs or occasionally the trunk. The current standard treatment is 8 weeks of daily rifampin and injections of streptomycin (RS). The treatment kills the bacilli and wounds gradually heal. We tried to determine if RS treatment actually stops mycolactone production before killing bacilli. Using a mouse footpad model of M. ulcerans infection where the time of infection and lesion development can be followed in a controlled manner before and after antibiotic treatment, we found that RS treatment rapidly reduced footpad swelling, M. ulcerans numbers, and ML production. Microscopic analysis of footpads revealed that RS treatment resulted in bacilli being destroyed by host cells whereas lack of treatment resulted in extracellular infection, destruction of host cells, and lesion ulceration. We propose that RS treatment promotes healing in the host by blocking mycolactone production, which favors the survival of host cells, and by killing M. ulcerans.
