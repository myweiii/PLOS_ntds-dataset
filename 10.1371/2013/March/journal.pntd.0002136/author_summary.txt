The disease schistosomiasis is caused by a parasitic blood fluke found mainly in the tropics and subtropics and affects over 200 million people worldwide. Using mice to model human schistosome infection, our previous studies showed that schistosome development in the infected host is linked to host immune function, such that parasite development is impaired in hosts with immunological deficiencies. CD4+ T cells and cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage are two types of immune cells that are involved in modulating schistosome development. In this study, we examined immune function in mice infected with developing schistosomes, to gain insights into how immune cells might influence parasite development. We found evidence of broad-spectrum suppression of CD4+ T cell responses during early schistosome infection. We also show that the loss of T cell responsiveness is due to impairment of T cell stimulation by CD11b+ cells. These findings suggest that exploitation of CD4+ T cells and monocytes/macrophages by schistosomes may involve parasite modification of the function of these cells.
