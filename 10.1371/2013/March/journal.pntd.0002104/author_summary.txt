Urogenital schistosomiasis (Bilharzia) is a common cause of gynecological disease in adult women. Reports to date indicate that genital lesions in adults become chronic and that the damages make women susceptible to HIV. This is the first study on urogenital schistosomiasis in pre-pubertal girls. We interviewed girls aged 10 to 12 years of age for urinary and gynecological symptoms. The research assistants did not know the schistosomiasis infection status in the school or the individuals. We collected three urines that were examined for schistosome eggs. We found that a significantly increased number of girls with urinary schistosomiasis have stinking, bloody discharge, ulcers, tumors and a burning sensation in their genitals. This indicates that gynecological damages due to schistosomiasis start before sexual activity, and before menstruation. By preventing urogenital schistosomiasis in girls we may have an innovative opportunity to reduce teenage HIV transmission and gynecological disease. This study presents a new aspect of a neglected disease affecting more than 100 million females, long overdue for mass intervention.
