Information gleaned from surveys of country-level policymakers and other opinion leaders can assist in planning the development, production and introduction of new or upcoming vaccines into public sector immunization programs. In the case of dengue vaccines, prevailing views among these leaders about the importance of the disease, their expressed level of interest in the government's use of the vaccine, and preferred strategies for vaccine introduction (e.g., geographically-targeted vs. nation-wide vaccination, specific age groups to target) can help to identify “early adopter” countries and indicate the level of demand for the vaccine. This information can be critical to current producers of the vaccine in planning their production capacity and to potential future producers in deciding whether to pursue development of the vaccine. This information also helps donors and international technical agencies, such as WHO and UNICEF, in setting their priorities and determining their level of technical and financial support to countries for the introduction of dengue vaccines. In addition, these surveys can provide crucial information to national governments and the above stakeholders about potential barriers to introducing dengue vaccines into national immunization programs, and what additional studies and data countries will require in order to make decisions about use of the vaccines in the public sector.
