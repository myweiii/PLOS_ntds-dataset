Ascaris lumbricoides and A. suum are common large roundworms that inhabit the small intestine in humans and pigs, respectively. Before the worms establish themselves in the small intestine, they first migrate through the host's liver and lungs, causing significant organ damage. After treatment, people and animals are quickly reinfected. An important reason for this is that immunity against this parasite is only slowly built up. In this study, we examined the intestinal immune response in animals after prolonged exposure that prevents Ascaris larvae from invading the host. Animals that were protected had increased numbers of eosinophils in the gut. In vitro assays showed that the eosinophils were able to kill larvae by releasing the toxic content of their granules after contact with the invading larvae. These findings shed new light on the mechanisms of protection against reinfections with Ascaris, providing a basis for further research into the development of immunological control strategies against this parasite.
