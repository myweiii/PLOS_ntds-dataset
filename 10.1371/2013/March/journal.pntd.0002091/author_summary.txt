Schistosomiasis is an endemic parasitic disease affecting âˆ¼200 million people in the most socioeconomically deprived regions of the world. Human infection occurs during water contact where free-living larvae called cercariae penetrate host skin and become parasitic organisms called schistosomula. This stage represents the first encounter of the parasites with the host and is also regarded as one of the most vulnerable stages of the parasite's life cycle. Therefore, schistosomula are the focus of many studies, many of which look at changes in the expression of genes as a way of understanding the process of infection, identifying potential drug targets and vaccine candidates. Because collecting enough parasitic material from natural infections is not possible for certain types of studies (for example, gene expression studies), a mechanical transformation of the cercariae into schistosomula is often used instead and assumed as a good proxy for the natural transformation process. However, the equivalency of gene expression profiles between naturally transformed parasites and the mechanically transformed counterparts has never been studied. In this report, we analyse differences in gene expression patterns between these two different parasite preparations and provide enough data to resolve a long-lasting controversy.
