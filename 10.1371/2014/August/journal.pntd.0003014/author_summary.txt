Schistosomiasis (S. haematobium and S. mansoni) and soil transmitted helminthiasis (STH) are endemic in Zimbabwe but there has not been any study conducted to systematically map out the disease for control. Due to the public health significance of schistosomiasis and STH in Zimbabwe, a nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted to map schistosomiasis and STH in 2010 and 2011, among 13,195 primary school children in 280 primary schools from 68 rural and urban districts in Zimbabwe. Urine filtration technique was used to determine the prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium. Both the Kato Katz and formol ether concentration techniques were used to determine the intensity and prevalence of S. mansoni and STH (hookworm, A. lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura). Overall, the prevalence of schistosomiasis was 22.7% (ranging from 0%–62% in districts) and that of STH was 5.5%, ranging from 0%–45% in districts. There was an overlap of schistosomiasis and STH in space (43 of the 68 districts). Based on the results of this study that confirm nationwide predominance in distribution of schistosomiasis and a lesser extent of STH, Preventive Chemotherapy strategies were determined and recommended for the elimination of these two specific NTD in Zimbabwe.
