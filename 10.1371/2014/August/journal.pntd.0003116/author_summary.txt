Toxocariasis is a parasitic worm infection that is transmitted by the ingestion of parasite eggs present in the feces of dogs and cats. After ingestion of the Toxocara eggs, the released larvae migrate through human organs, including the lungs, liver, brain, and eyes, where they cause inflammation and organ damage. The different larval migrans syndromes associated with toxocariasis are diagnosed by detecting Toxocara antibodies in sera of infected individuals. This study is a systematic review to in order assess the prevalence of toxocariasis in North America and whether selected groups are at risk for infection. The prevalence was highest among Mexican children with asthma, but also African Americans living in poverty exhibited high rates of infection. Among the major risk factors for infection were African-American ethnicity, male sex, pet ownership, and environmental contamination by animal species. Additional high risk groups in Mexico included waste pickers, asthmatic children, and inpatient psychiatry patients. Further research is needed to determine the true current burden of toxocariasis in North America; however, the prevalence estimates gathered in this review suggest that the burden of disease is significant. Thus, toxocariasis may be emerging as an important health disparity in North America
