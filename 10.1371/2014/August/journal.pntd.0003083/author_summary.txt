In 2012, Europe saw its first dengue epidemic taking place on the Atlantic island of Madeira. Due to strong tourism links, 81 cases were introduced into continental Europe in a short period of three months. Although Aedes aegypti, the mosquito-vector responsible for this particular outbreak, is extinct in mainland Europe, climatic and globalization trends have eased the recent establishment of Aedes albopictus, dengue's secondary vector, in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Before this epidemic, dengue had only sporadically achieved short chains of transmission. The presence of fully susceptible populations, however, makes the possible introduction into Europe a major public health concern. Here, using a mathematical approach, we analysed Madeira's dengue outbreak, focusing on the necessary conditions for introduction, spread and persistence. We find that natural temperature cycles were the determining factor for the 2012's outbreak demise, and are generally expected to severely disrupt dengue transmission between November and April, suggesting weak potential for endemicity. On the other hand, Madeira demonstrates a high potential for sporadic and potentially large epidemics in the remaining summer months, especially if the virus is introduced early during the warm season.
