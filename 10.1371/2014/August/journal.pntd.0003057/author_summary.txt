Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a chronic, complex and neglected parasitic infection presenting mostly as hepatic cysts, which are staged by ultrasound. Recent expert opinion recommends that uncomplicated inactive cysts should be left untreated and solely monitored over time, using the so-called “watch-and-wait” approach. Currently, no reliable biological marker of cyst activity is available. Positive antibody titers may persist for years even after removal of a cyst; therefore a long-term follow-up is required to assess the evolution of the cyst's biological activity over time. The watch-and-wait approach to inactive hepatic CE cysts is increasingly used in selected cases in referral centers; however, no data on its safety and effectiveness has yet been published. We retrospectively studied 47 inactive uncomplicated cysts at diagnosis, managed by a watch-and-wait approach, with a median follow-up of 51.95 months. We observed that these cysts remained inactive over time in almost all cases, without any complications. These results support the watch-and-wait approach to these cysts. Furthermore, we confirmed that serology only plays an ancillary role in the clinical management of these patients, compared to ultrasound and other imaging techniques.
