The single-celled parasite Trypanosoma cruzi occurs in mammals and insect vectors in the Americas. When transmitted to humans it causes Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) a major public health problem. T. cruzi is genetically diverse and currently split into six groups, known as TcI to TcVI. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a method used for studying the population structure and diversity of pathogens and involves sequencing DNA of several different genes and comparing the sequences between isolates. Here, we assess 13 T. cruzi genes and select the best combination for diversity studies. Outputs reveal that a combination of 7 genes can be used for both lineage assignment and high resolution studies of genetic diversity, and a reduced combination of four loci for lineage assignment. Application of MLST for assigning field isolates of T. cruzi to genetic groups and for detailed investigation of diversity provides a valuable approach to understanding the taxonomy, population structure, genetics, ecology and epidemiology of this important human pathogen.
