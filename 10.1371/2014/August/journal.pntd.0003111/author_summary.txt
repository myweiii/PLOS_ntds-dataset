Paracoccidioides lutzii is currently recognized as a distinct species from P. brasiliensis that until then was solely responsible for paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). Serological diagnostic of this primary systemic mycosis is quite sensitive due to the expression of P. brasiliensis antigen gp43, which has specific peptide epitopes recognized by patients' sera. Unexpected PCM false-negative reactions have recently been reported for patients from Midwestern/Northern Brazil, where P. lutzii (“Pb01-like”) apparently predominates. In our work, 33 PCM false-negative sera from Midwestern Brazil, including two cases of P. lutzii genotyped isolates, did not recognize recombinant Plp43 (gp43 ortholog from Pb01) or gp43 (native purified or recombinant), suggesting Plp43 is possibly underexpressed in vivo. Gp43-positive sera reacted with rPl43 showing that common epitopes do exist, although anti-gp43 MAbs did not recognize the orthologous P. lutzii protein. The main finding of our work is that gp43 cannot be used in diagnosis of PCM patients infected with P. lutzii.
