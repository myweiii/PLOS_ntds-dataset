We gratefully thank the population of Ndieumeul and Diokhor Tack and the village chiefs, Daoure Mbaye and Daouda Pene, for their hospitality and participation in this study. This study would not have been possible without the field workers in Richard Toll, Abdoulaye Yague, Mankeur Diop, Moussa Wade and Ngary Sy, who assisted in the sample collection and microscopic analysis. We would also like to thank the medical and technical staff of the Health Centre in Richard Toll for their support, Yvonne Kruize for providing the immunologic stimuli and preparatory work, Rogier Achterberg, Mareen Datema and Churnalisa Doran for the cytokine measurements in Leiden, Pierre Legendre from the University of Montreal and Vincent Sluydts from Antwerp for their useful advice on multivariate analyses, as well as Lies Durnez from Antwerp for critically reviewing the statistical methods used. In addition, we would like to thank one of the reviewers who made important contributions to our manuscript in two Review rounds.
