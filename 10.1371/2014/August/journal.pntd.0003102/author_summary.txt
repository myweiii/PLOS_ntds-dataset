Mycetoma is a chronic, subcutaneous granulomatous disease that usually begins after traumatic inoculation with causative microorganisms. Based on its etiology, mycetoma is referred to eumycetoma when the infection is caused by filamentous fungi, and actinomycetoma when the infection is due to aerobic actinomycetes (in Mexico predominantly Nocardia brasiliensis). Establishing the etiology is extremely important since it impacts treatment regimens. Mycetoma typically presents around the Tropic of Cancer between latitude 15° South and 30° North (also known as “mycetoma belt”) affecting poor populations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, including Mexico, which represents a highly endemic area with higher frequencies of actinomycetomas. Mycetoma usually affects males (male∶female ratio of 3∶1), agricultural or rural workers (age range 20–40 years) that typically do not have access to protective equipment. The main clinical presentation is as soft tissue swelling with sinus tract formation draining grains, which leads to diagnosis. The foot is the most commonly affected localization; however, when disease presents in high risk areas, such as the trunk, it can disseminate to the lungs and spinal cord. This report represents a single center study which provides epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiological data of mycetoma cases in different regions of Mexico.
