Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the parasite Schistosoma spp. Over 240 million people are infected worldwide, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, but an efficacious, protective vaccine has yet to be found. Protection against schistosome infection in individuals living in endemic areas is mediated by antibodies. In particular, IgG1 antibody has been shown to be protective against infection in individuals living in endemic areas, and eliciting IgG1 production has become a cornerstone of vaccine development efforts. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which IgG1 induces protection. The cell surface molecule CD16 is an IgG antibody receptor expressed on monocytes and binds preferentially to IgG antibody subclasses. The work presented here thus investigates the relationship between IgG levels and the monocyte CD16 receptor in a population endemically exposed to infection with schistosomes. We present results linking CD16 expression with IgG1 levels, whereby uninfected individuals have a positive relationship between IgG1 and CD16 expression levels, while schistosome infected individuals did not show any statistically significant relationship between the two. Thus we provide evidence to suggest a mechanistic link between the innate and adaptive immune response in parasitic infection, associating monocyte CD16 expression with a protective immune response.
