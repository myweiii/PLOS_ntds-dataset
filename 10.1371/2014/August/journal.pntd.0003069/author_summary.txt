Historically, cystic echinococcosis (CE) is one of the most important zoonotic diseases in Spain. The initiation of a number of control campaigns in the second half of the 1980s has led to a substantial reduction of the number of CE infections both in humans and livestock species. As a consequence of this initial success, obligation to report human CE cases was revoked in 1997 in a number of Spanish autonomous regions that were consequently considered non-endemic for CE. This policy has not been translated to livestock species, where the identification of hydatid cysts and the reporting of prevalence data remain compulsory in all national slaughterhouses. We present here an estimation of the human and animal CE associated monetary losses in the province of Álava, North Spain, for the year 2005. Obtained economic data corroborate the epidemiological findings and demonstrate that CE has important socio-economic consequences in Álava. Taking together, our data suggest that surveillance status of CE in Álava (and very likely in other Spanish regions currently classified as non-endemic areas) should be reassessed. The situation also indicates that more accurate and effective methods for detecting and reporting the disease at the regional and national level are greatly needed.
