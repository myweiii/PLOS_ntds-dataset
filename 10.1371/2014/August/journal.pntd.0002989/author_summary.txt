Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease affecting approximately 10 million people in the world. It is caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. As a consequence of migration flows, the disease has been also become established in non-endemic countries. In this study, the functional and phenotypic profile of inflammatory T cells were evaluated in heart tissues of patients with end-stage chronic Chagas disease by analyzing the expression of inhibitory receptors, transcription factors of type 1 or regulatory T cells, and markers of T cell differentiation, immunosenescence or active cell cycle. Most infiltrating cells displayed markers of antigen-experienced T cells with a low grade of differentiation and a significant proliferative capacity. A skewed T helper1/T cytotoxic 1 profile was supported by the expression of T-bet; whereas FOXP3+ cells were scarce. The quality of T cell responses and immunoregulatory mechanisms might determine the pattern of the cellular response and the severity of disease in Trypanosoma cruzi infection.
