Parasitic nematodes cause serious global health problems and enormous economic losses. Control of these parasites is difficult due to their complicated life cycle and the lack of knowledge of their developmental biology at the molecular level. Protein kinases are key molecules regulating a range of biological processes of organisms. The atypical protein kinase RIOK-1 was reported to be indispensable in yeast, as well as in free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, but little is known about its function in parasitic nematodes. In the present study, we investigate the RIOK-1 encoding gene (Ss-riok-1) and its predicted protein Ss-RIOK-1 from parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis which causes canine and human diseases. We found that Ss-RIOK-1 has high sequence identities (50â€“65%) to its homologues from both vertebrates and invertebrates. It also has abilities of phosphorylation and auto-phosphorylation in vitro. Ss-riok-1 transcript is present in all stages of S. stercoralis with more abundance in the parasitic stages than in the free-living stages, along with the gene expression in neuron system of post free-living L1 and body muscle of iL3, indicating that it plays important role in the development and infection of S. stercoralis. The findings have important implications for understanding the function of RIOK-1 in the development of parasitic nematodes.
