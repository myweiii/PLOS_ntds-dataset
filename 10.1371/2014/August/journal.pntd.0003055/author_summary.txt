Q fever is a disease that could be transmitted from animals (cattle, sheep and goats) to humans and caused by a bacterium called Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii). Some human cases exhibiting characteristic clinical signs of that disease have been detected on Reunion Island, a tropical island in the Indian Ocean, but to date, we did not know if these animals could be seen as potential sources of the disease. Thus, a study was undertaken from March 2011 to August 2012 to detect the presence of that bacterium in these animals and to understand how they could get infected themselves. A total of 516 ruminants (245 cattle, 137 sheep and 134 goats) belonging to 71 farms and localized in different environments of the island were selected. Samples of blood, vaginal mucus and milk were concomitantly collected from females, and a questionnaire was submitted to the farmers. Ticks from positively detected farms were also collected. We observed 11.8% of cattle, 1.4% of sheep and 13.4% of goats had already been in contact with the bacterium. Coxiella burnetii was also directly detected in some vaginal and milk samples. None of the ticks were detected to be positive for C. burnetii. We found that the ruminants could be infected when their farm was exposed to prevailing winds because the bacterium can be transported by the wind, and when there were no specific precautions for visitors before entering the farm, because they could act as mechanical carriers of Coxiella. Conversely, keeping new animals under surveillance for some days to detect any signs of the disease before they enter the farm or keeping the animals in the barn at night limit the risk of infection.
