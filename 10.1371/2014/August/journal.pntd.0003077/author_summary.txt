Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, was exclusively confined to Latin America but it has recently spread to other regions of the world. Chagas disease affects 8â€“10 million people and kills thousands of them every year. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a major bioactive phospholipid of human plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid similar to LPC and a potent intercellular mediator. Both PAF and LPC have been reported to act on mammalian cells through PAF receptor (PAFR). Previous data from our group suggested that T. cruzi produces a phospholipid with PAF activity. Here, we describe the structural and functional analysis of different species of LPC from T. cruzi, including a LPC with a fatty acid chain of 18 carbon atoms and one double bond (C18:1-LPC). We also show that C18:1-LPC is able to induce rabbit platelet aggregation, which is abrogated by a PAFR antagonist. In addition, a three-dimensional model of human PAFR was constructed. Contrary to other T. cruzi LPC molecules, C18:1-LPC is predicted to interact with the PAFR model in a fashion similar to PAF. Further studies are needed to validate the biosynthesis of T. cruzi C18:1-LPC as a potential drug target in Chagas disease.
