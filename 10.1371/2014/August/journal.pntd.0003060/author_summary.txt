Schistosomiasis is a chronic parasitic disease that infects millions of people, especially in Africa. Schistosomes are transmitted by direct contact with water sources infested by freshwater snails, which are intermediate hosts for the parasite. The cure in humans is a drug, praziquantel, that kills the mature parasites inside the human body. The main problem with controlling the parasite by drug treatment is the high re-infection rate, since individuals are in contact with infected water on a daily basis. To efficiently combat the disease, an integrated management program is needed that includes control of infection in the intermediate host snails. We suggest the use of non-migrating, all-male populations of freshwater prawns that efficiently prey on these snails. Here, we describe the case of the Senegal River basin as an example of human actions (dam construction) that resulted in severe ecosystem changes, including exclusion of the native river prawns and expansion of snails hosting schistosomiasis. We have conducted an interdisciplinary study that documents the reduction of prawn abundance in the Senegal River and lays the molecular foundation for technology to produce all-male prawn populations to be used as part of an integrated disease control program, including both periodic stocking of juvenile prawns and chemotherapy.
