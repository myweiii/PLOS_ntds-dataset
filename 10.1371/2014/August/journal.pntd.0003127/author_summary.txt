Central nervous system (CNS) infections are important diseases worldwide. The spectrum of infections is broad, encompassing bacterial/aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. Viruses are regarded as the most common causes of encephalitis and aseptic meningitis. Better understanding of the causes of the diseases is of public health importance, in order to better inform immunization policy, and influence clinical management. We describe the clinical features and infectious causes of 291 adults with clinically suspected CNS infections of presumed viral origin. We show that CNS viral infections in Vietnam are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Mortality was especially high (47%) amongst those with herpes simplex encephalitis which is attributed to the limited availability specific antiviral drugs in our setting. Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue viruses, herpes simplex virus and enteroviruses were the most common viruses detected, followed by rubella virus, varicella zoster virus, mumps virus, cytomegalovirus, and rabies virus. Our study represents the broadest yet investigation of the possible viral causes of the CNS infections in adults in Vietnam, with a diagnostic yield of 32%. The results show that the majority of morbidity/mortality amongst patients with a confirmed/probable diagnosis could be prevented by adequate vaccination or treatment, and are therefore of public health significance.
