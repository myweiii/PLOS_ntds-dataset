    "Abstract": "Our investigations show that nonlethal concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) abrogate the antibiotic activity of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics against Burkholderia pseudomallei, Escherichia coli and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. NO protects B. pseudomallei already exposed to \u03b2-lactams, suggesting that this diatomic radical tolerizes bacteria against the antimicrobial activity of this important class of antibiotics. The concentrations of NO that elicit antibiotic tolerance repress consumption of oxygen (O2), while stimulating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. Transposon insertions in genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase-related functions and molybdenum assimilation confer B. pseudomallei a selective advantage against the antimicrobial activity of the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic imipenem. Cumulatively, these data support a model by which NO induces antibiotic tolerance through the inhibition of the electron transport chain, rather than by potentiating antioxidant defenses as previously proposed. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of terminal oxidases and nitrate reductases tolerizes aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to \u03b2-lactams. The degree of NO-induced \u03b2-lactam antibiotic tolerance seems to be inversely proportional to the proton motive force (PMF), and thus the dissipation of \u0394H+ and \u0394\u03a8 electrochemical gradients of the PMF prevents \u03b2-lactam-mediated killing. According to this model, NO generated by IFN\u03b3-primed macrophages protects intracellular Salmonella against imipenem. On the other hand, sublethal concentrations of imipenem potentiate the killing of B. pseudomallei by NO generated enzymatically from IFN\u03b3-primed macrophages. Our investigations indicate that NO modulates the antimicrobial activity of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics."
