β-lactam drugs that inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis are often used in the treatment of bacterial infections, including melioidosis. Independent of their antibiotic activity, we have noted that submicromolar concentrations of β-lactams potentiate the killing of intracellular B. pseudomallei supported by NO generated by IFNγ-primed macrophages. The production of NO can nonetheless be a double-edged sword, as indicated by our observations that sublethal concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), a diatomic radical produced by phylogenetically diverse organisms to regulate neurotransmission, vascular tone and host defense, tolerize B. pseudomallei, nontyphoidal Salmonella and E. coli against the antimicrobial activity of β-lactams. Accordingly, NO produced in the inflammatory response of macrophages protects nontyphoidal Salmonella against β-lactam antibiotics. NO mediates bacterial tolerance to β-lactam antibiotics by inhibiting the electrochemical gradient supported by terminal cytochrome oxidases of the respiratory chain, rather than by decreasing oxidative stress as previously thought.
