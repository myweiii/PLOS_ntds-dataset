Schistosomiasis affects more than 200 million people worldwide and causes up to 280,000 deaths per year. In terms of global mortality and morbidity, this disease is the most important human helminth infection. Current control strategies are based on chemotherapy, but recurrent re-infection of people living in endemic areas makes many researchers, and also the World Health Organization, search for an effective vaccine to provide protection against schistosomiasis. Substantial efforts have been committed to the characterization of new antigens for an anti-schistosome vaccine and, in order to find new targets for vaccine and/or drug development, we searched transcriptomics and proteomics of Schistosoma mansoni and identified the protein syntenin (SmSynt) for analysis. In this study, we characterize SmSynt and evaluate its potential as a vaccine candidate to protect mice against S. mansoni infection. We demonstrate that SmSynt is expressed in schistosomula and adult worms, the intravascular stages of S. mansoni and it is located in the intestinal tract of the worms, an important host/parasite interface. Furthermore, vaccination of mice with rSmSynt confers partial protection against S. mansoni challenge infection and ameliorates parasite-induced liver pathology. Our data suggest that SmSynt is a potential candidate in the development of a vaccine against schistosomiasis.
