Filarial nematodes are responsible for a number of neglected tropical diseases. The vast majority of these human parasites harbor the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia. Wolbachia are essential for filarial nematode survival and reproduction, and thus are a promising anti-filarial drug target. Understanding the molecular and cellular basis of Wolbachia-nematode interactions will facilitate the development of a new class of drugs that specifically disrupt these interactions. Here we focus on Wolbachia segregation patterns and interactions with the host cytoskeleton during early embryogenesis. Our studies indicate that centrosomes are maternally inherited in filarial nematodes resulting in a posterior microtubule-organizing center of maternal origin, unique to filarial nematodes. This microtubule-organizing center facilitates the concentration of Wolbachia at the posterior pole. We find that the microtubule motor dynein is required for the proper posterior Wolbachia localization. In addition, we demonstrate that Wolbachia rely on polarity signals in the egg for their preferential localization at the posterior pole. Conversely, Wolbachia are required for normal embryonic axis determination and Wolbachia removal leads to distinct anterior-posterior embryonic polarity defects. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a bacterial endosymbiont required for normal host embryogenesis.
