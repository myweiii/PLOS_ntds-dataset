Azithromycin was donated to the National Eye Health Programme of The Gambia through the Trachoma donation program at Pfizer International managed by International Trachoma Initiative. Pfizer and ITI had no role in the design, conduct, data collection, management, or interpretation of the data. The work completed by the PRET team in The Gambia is gratefully acknowledged, along with the work of the NEHP team who distributed treatment and recorded treatment receipt (treatment team leaders: Ousman Jallow, Mohammed Jallow, Omar Sey, Modou Lamin Njie, Wandifa Ceesay). We thank Simon Brooker and Jorge Cano Ortega for advice on spatial analysis methods and software. We are also grateful to Simon Brooker for comments on the manuscript.
