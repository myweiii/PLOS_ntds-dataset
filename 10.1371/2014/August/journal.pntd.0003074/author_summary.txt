Intestinal parasitic infections (IPI) are still a major public health problem worldwide, with more than 2 billion people infected with at least one parasite species. Despite efforts to improve the quality of life of the Orang Asli population in rural Malaysia, IPI are still highly prevalent and of serious concern in this population, especially among children. We screened 498 school children in Lipis district, Pahang, Malaysia for the prevalence and risk factors of polyparasitism (concurrent infection with multiple parasite species). Overall, 98.4% of the children were found to be infected by at least one parasite species, with 71.4% of them having polyparasitism. Using an unsafe water supply as a source for drinking water, presence of another family member infected with IPI, not washing vegetables before consumption, absence of a toilet in the house, not wearing shoes when outside, not cutting nails periodically, and not washing hands before eating were significantly associated with intestinal polyparasitism among these children. Our findings revealed an urgent need to implement an effective and integrated control program to reduce the prevalence of IPI as a part of the efforts to improve the quality of life in Orang Asli communities.
