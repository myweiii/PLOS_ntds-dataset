The fungal genus Paracoccidioides is the causal agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a neglected tropical disease that is endemic in several countries of South America. Paracoccidioides is a pathogenic dimorphic fungus that is capable of converting to a virulent yeast form after inhalation by the host. Therefore the molecular biology of the switch to the yeast phase is of particular interest for understanding the virulence of this and other human pathogenic fungi, and ultimately for reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by such fungal infections. We here present the strategy and methods we used to update and improve accuracy of three reference genome sequences of Paracoccidioides spp. utilizing state-of-the-art Illumina re-sequencing, assembly improvement, re-annotation, and quality assessment. The resulting improved genome resource should be of wide use not solely for advancing research on the genetics and molecular biology of Paracoccidioides and the closely related pathogenic species Histoplasma and Blastomyces, but also for fungal diagnostics based on sequencing or molecular assays, characterizing rapidly changing proteins that may be involved in virulence, SNP-based population analyses and other tasks that require high sequence accuracy. The genome update and underlying strategy and methods also serve as a proof of principle that could encourage similar improvements of other draft genomes.
