Infectious diseases like malaria and parasitic worms affect hundreds of millions of people, and impact physical and cognitive development of children in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Over the past 20 years, it was debated how the magnitude of ill-health due to these conditions should be assessed. One proposed strategy was to include patient-based ratings of wellbeing by administration of health-related quality of life (HrQoL) questionnaires. In order to provide new evidence on disability from parasitic infections, we conducted HrQoL interviews with children aged 5–16 years from 92 schools across Côte d'Ivoire. Children were examined for parasitic infections and clinical signs like anemia, malnutrition, and organ enlargement. We compared the self-rated HrQoL of infected and non-infected children and also considered their sociodemographic background. We could not identify lowered HrQoL in infected children, but we found that children with anemia reported a 1-point lower score on a 100-point HrQoL scale in comparison with their non-anemic counterparts. We consider our HrQoL questionnaire as useful and valid, but would recommend its further testing and development in few purposefully selected settings. Further investigation of disability induced by malaria and parasitic worm infections is warranted.
