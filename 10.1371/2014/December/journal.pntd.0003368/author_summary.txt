Treatment of eumycetoma largely depends on the causative pathogen. Identification of mycetoma agent with phenotypic features is too limited, and physiological and biochemical techniques are laborious, time-consuming and nonspecific, whereas the currently available molecular methods based on DNA sequencing are specific but extremely expensive. We describe rolling circle amplification method for identification of black grain eumycetoma using species-specific padlock probes. Eight probes were designed and successfully used for species identification and the results were easily visualized in 1% agarose gel. RCA provides a simple, reproducible, and cost-effective method for rapid identification of mycetoma agent that can be used in low-resource clinical settings.
