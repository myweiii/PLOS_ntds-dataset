The arboviruses are a group of viruses transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, or sandflies. These pathogens have complex life cycles and depend on both arthropods and vertebrate hosts for survival and transmission. Recent global increase in cases confirms that they are of great public health concern. In this study, conducted in the winter of 2010, the seroprevalence and determinants of infections were investigated in the republic of Djibouti, Horn of Africa. The highest seroprevalence values were observed for mosquito-borne diseases, in particular dengue (transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes); antibodies to dengue virus were found in a fifth of the sampled population. Most Djiboutians were initially unexposed to Chikungunya virus (also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes), but a few months later, many got infected, resulting in an outbreak. Of the few West Nile virus seropositive cases detected, the majority were in places where WNV had been previously identified in Culex mosquitoes. In addition, seropositive cases of Toscana-related viruses (transmitted by sandflies), and tick-borne encephalitis virus or Alkhumra-related viruses (transmitted by ticks) were also observed. In this study, the risk of arboviral infections was mostly associated with environmental and behavioural risk factors, with highest risk prevailing in the city centre (District 1). Overall, the results suggest a likely exposure to the local circulation of arboviruses, rather than infections acquired outside the study area. This knowledge, therefore, confirms the impact of arbovirus infections in Djibouti, and is essential for prevention and control programs.
