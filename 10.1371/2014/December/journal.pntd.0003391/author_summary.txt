Leishmaniasis, a disease caused by protozoan parasites under the genus Leishmania, claims the lives of thousands of people annually. It mainly affects people in poor communities in Africa, Asia and South America. Although several drugs are available for the treatment of leishmaniasis, their efficacy is limited by the emergence of drug resistant parasite strains and by the inherent side-effects of some drugs. In light of these challenges, developing effective vaccine is considered as a crucial step in the control and ultimate elimination of the disease. In this study, we have evaluated the potential of the antioxidant Leishmania Peroxidoxin-1 as a candidate vaccine for leishmaniasis. The efficacy of the candidate vaccine was assessed in DNA-Protein immunization strategy in mice. We also investigated the adjuvant role of GMCSF DNA fused with the vaccine antigen in a pcDNA plasmid vector. The result showed that Leishmania Peroxidoxin-1 together with fusion GMCSF adjuvant in a pcDNA plasmid induces a partially protective immune response in mice. Further analysis of the immune response demonstrated that the antigen-adjuvant combination elicits CD4+ T cells that express IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-2. The antigen also induced a high frequency of CD4+ T cells that simultaneously express all the three cytokines. The study on samples taken from leishmaniasis patients showed that the recombinant Leishmania Peroxidoxin-1 protein is recognized by and elicit immune response in humans, a crucial requirement in the development of a vaccine.
