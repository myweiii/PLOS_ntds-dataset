Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a pathogenic fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) in humans, a debilitating fungal infection that mainly affects the lungs and is widespread in Latin America. Paracoccin (PCN) is a sugar-binding protein produced by this fungus. Previous studies have shown that PCN contributes to the colonization of host tissues by the fungus and induces the production of inflammatory factors (i.e., cytokines and nitric oxide) by immune cells such as macrophages. Here we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant PCN (rPCN) on the course of P. brasiliensis infection in mice. Histopathological analysis of lungs of animals treated with rPCN showed much lower inflammation in comparison to untreated, control mice. In addition, fewer infective P. brasiliensis yeast forms were recovered from the lung of rPCN-treated animals than from that of control animals. Administration of rPCN was associated with a profile of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in the lung that was conducive to host protection. These effects were associated with PCN binding to sugar chains linked to innate immunity receptors, namely Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. These findings reveal a mechanism by which rPCN confers protection against PCM.
