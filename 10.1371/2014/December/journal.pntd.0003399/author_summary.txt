HTLV-1 predominantly infects T cells, inducing cell proliferation and activation. While there is a larger amount of studies regarding T cells functions in HTLV-1 infected subjects, little is known about innate immunity. We evaluated monocyte and macrophage functions in HTLV-1 infected subjects. We observed that HAM/TSP patients have an increased frequency of intermediate monocytes, but expression of co-stimulatory molecules in these cells was similar between HTLV-1 infected subjects and healthy subjects (HS). Additionally, the microbicidal ability of macrophages from HTLV-1 infected subjects to kill Leishmania braziliensis is preserved, and these cells showed inflammatory profile, producing more CXCL9 and CCL5, and less IL-10 than macrophages from HS. It was important to determine if the exacerbated ability of macrophages to secrete cytokine was due to IFN-γ production. While there was no correlation between IFN-γ levels by PBMCs and cytokine/chemokine production by macrophages, there was a direct correlation between proviral load and TNF and CXCL10 levels. Our data indicate that despite the high production of proinflammatory mediators, macrophages from HTLV-1 infected subjects kill an intracellular pathogen in similar levels than cells from HS and pointed out for the role of viral factors inducing the inflammatory response in these cells.
