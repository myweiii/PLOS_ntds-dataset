Snakebite is a major public health problem and understanding the effectiveness of antivenom is essential to improving health outcomes. The measurement of venom in blood has been used to assess the effectiveness of antivenom. The absence of venom post-antivenom indicating that sufficient antivenom has been given, and the persistence or recurrence of venom indicating that insufficient antivenom has been given. There are numerous reports of venom recurrence with viper bites, including Russell's viper bites. However, it remains unclear if venom recurrence is always an indicator of inadequate antivenom and recurrence of clinical envenoming. In this study, we compare patients with and without the persistence or recurrence of venom who develop coagulopathy after Russell's viper bites. There was no difference in the recovery of the coagulopathy between the two groups of patients demonstrating that for Russell's viper envenoming, venom recurrence or persistence was not associated with the recurrence or persistence of clinical effects such as coagulopathy. Patients with detectable venom after antivenom did have higher pre-antivenom venom concentrations. Further investigation is required to interpret venom concentrations post-antivenom.
