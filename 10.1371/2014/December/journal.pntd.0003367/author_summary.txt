The protozoan parasites, Leishmania donovani, replicate within the macrophages of the mammalian hosts. During its intracellular lifecycle, the parasite induces a wide variety of defects in the membrane homeostasis. Membrane bound receptor molecules are important for interacting with external stimuli. Our study very clearly showed that there is an increase in the mobility of membrane protein coupled with decrease in F-actin in infected cells, which may be corrected by liposomal cholesterol treatment. This observation indicates that intracellular parasite may alter the membrane biology of infected cells which may dampen overall cellular function.
