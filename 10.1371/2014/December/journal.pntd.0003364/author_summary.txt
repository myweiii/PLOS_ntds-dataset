Despite the threat posed by Rift Valley fever (RVF), poor understanding of the disease epidemiology exists with respect to vector population structure in relation to differential outbreak patterns and future vector genetic control. Here, nuclear and mtDNA data reveal genetic complexities of RVF key vectors (Aedes mcintoshi and Ae. ochraceus) partly explaining the disease outbreak pattern in Kenya. While anticipating population differentiation, we found that the hitherto known Ae. mcintoshi in fact comprises a species complex, with one unique species restricted to northeastern Kenya where outbreaks have increased in frequency with evidence for new involvement of Ae. ochraceus in RVF epidemiology. We infer a relatively recent, single “introduction” of Ae. ochraceus into Kenya with genetic links to a RVF hotspot in Senegal. Ultimately, our findings provide an understanding of how the two primary mosquito vector species impact RVF, which is critical to the potential prediction of the emergence and spread of the disease in Kenya.
