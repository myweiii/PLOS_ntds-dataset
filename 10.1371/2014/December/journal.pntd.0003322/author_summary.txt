Efforts are in progress by various scientific groups towards the development of plague vaccines. However, lack of better understanding about the Y. pestis infection mechanisms and pathogenesis prevents the development of an effective vaccine. In our effort to develop a more efficacious plague vaccine, we evaluated the role of HSP70 (domain II) of M. tuberculosis in formulation with the F1 and LcrV subunits of Y. pestis vaccine candidates. It is well documented that the F1 and LcrV alone does not always provide complete protection whereas a mixture of the F1+LcrV provides 100% protection in mouse model but poorly protect African green monkey models. In this study, LcrV provided 100% protection in formulation with HSP70(II) whereas LcrV alone could provide only 75% protection in Y. pestis challenged mice. Two another combinations i.e., F1+LcrV and F1+LcrV+HSP70(II) also provided 100% protection whereas HSP70(II) or F1 alone failed to protect. HSP70(II) also modulated cellular immune response as the significantly elevated levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IFN-γ secreting CD4+/CD8+ T cells were noticed in spleen of F1+LcrV+HSP70(II) group in comparison to the F1+LcrV group. These findings describe the role of HSP70(II) and propose future perspectives for development of new generation plague vaccine.
