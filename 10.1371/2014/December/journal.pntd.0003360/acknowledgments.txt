Thanks to L. Chittka and S. Faruq for answering my questions on their calculation methods and supplying me with their calculation spreadsheet, on which mine is based. Thanks also to R. C. Hardie for kindly supplying an original copy of his manuscript, and to P. J. Moore for alerting me to DataThief software. Above all, thanks to the authors of the original tsetse fly field studies, whose rigorous experimentation and comprehensive reporting of it made this analysis possible.
