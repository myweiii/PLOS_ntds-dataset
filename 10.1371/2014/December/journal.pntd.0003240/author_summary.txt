Noma is a traumatic disease characterized by oral-facial lesions that often lead to severe disfigurement and ultimately shame and isolation from the community. Because the causes of noma are likely to be numerous, and reaching those who suffer from this illness is challenging, the etiology of noma remains ill-defined. Although it is known that oral hygiene and nutrition influence the development of noma, evidence suggests that one or more microbes play a crucial role in development of noma lesions. Previous studies have examined the DNA of microbes in lesions to determine which species are present and how their abundances differ between healthy mouth sites and noma lesions. These studies used techniques that were state-of-the-art at the time, though we know they likely only scratched the surface of the resident microbial diversity. Here we extend these studies by digging deeper to characterize a larger diversity of microbial species in noma and control samples, with the goal of better identifying which microbes are uniquely present or have altered abundances in noma lesions.
