Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) are a family of enzymes expressed in many eukaryotes, ranging from single-celled parasites to mammals. In mammals, NTPDases can have an immunomodulatory role, while in pathogenic protists cell-surface and secreted NTPDases are thought to be important virulence factors, although this has never been explicitly tested. In this study we have investigated the function of two NTPDases, termed LmNTPDase1 and LmNTPDase2, in Leishmania major parasites. We show that LmNTPDase 1 and LmNTPDase 2 are differentially targeted to the Golgi apparatus and secreted, respectively. A Leishmania major mutant lacking the Golgi LmNTPDase1 exhibited a delayed capacity to induce lesions in susceptible mice when promastigote (insect) stages were used to initiate infection, but not when amastigote (mammalian-infective) stages were used. Loss of promastigote infectivity in the LmNTPDase1 null mutant was associated with the synthesis and surface expression of lipophosphoglycan (LPG), with shorter glycan chains and increased sensitivity to complement-mediated lysis. In contrast, a null mutant lacking the secreted LmNTPDase2 did not exhibit any difference in virulence. Our results suggest that Leishmania major NTPDases have specific roles in regulating Golgi glycosylation pathways, and nucleoside salvage pathways in the insect stages, but do not appear to be required for virulence of the mammalian-infective stages.
