Leprosy is a progressive disease of the skin and nervous system caused by the bacillus, Mycobacterium leprae. Implementation of multiple drug therapy (MDT) for leprosy has significantly reduced the global cases of leprosy. Currently, only a few endemic countries remain where relatively high number of cases persists.  Despite global reduction of leprosy and the concomitant decrease in human reservoirs, leprosy transmission and incidence have not declined as expected, suggesting a possible extra-human or environmental source of the bacilli. In the current study, we demonstrate that M. leprae can survive long-term within cysts of common environmental free-living amoebae.  M. leprae residing in amoebal cysts for over 30 days remain fully capable of transferring disease to mouse footpads and retain viability phenotypes after several months residence within amoebal cysts. It is hypothesized that these protozoa provide an intracellular refuge for M. leprae in environments for which they would otherwise seem ill suited. Traits allowing bacilli to survive in macrophages may likely be acquired via an evolutionary response against predation by amoebae. The results from this work suggest alternative non-human reservoirs for M. leprae exist fostering further study to determine the role of amoebae in the transmission of this Mycobacterium to humans.
