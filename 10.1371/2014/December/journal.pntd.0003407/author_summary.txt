Two types of blood-dwelling parasitic worms that cause schistosomiasis (i.e., Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni) are endemic in Côte d′Ivoire, West Africa. Reliable information on their geographical distribution is needed to plan and guide the national control program. Recently, control efforts have been intensified. There is a need to update risk maps that, historically, have been based on data specific to each type of parasite. In late 2011 and early 2012, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in 92 schools all over Côte d′Ivoire. We used Bayesian geostatistical multinomial models to estimate the risk for each infection, as well as co-infection. We estimated that slightly less than 10% of school-aged children are affected by schistosomiasis (5.3% with S. haematobium and 3.8% with S. mansoni). To control schistosomiasis with the deworming drug praziquantel, approximately 2 million treatments would be necessary each year. The distinct spatial patterns of S. haematobium and S. mansoni imply that co-infection with these two types of parasitic worms is rare across the country. Our results provide a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of schistosomiasis risk among school-aged children in Côte d′Ivoire, which will inform the national control program for targeted interventions.
