Schistosomiasis is a serious disease in many developing countries, and the control of schistosomiasis relies on the large-scale administration of praziquantel. However, this strategy fails to address the root causes of schistosomiasis, which people acquire during contact with freshwater bodies that contain infected snails. It is suggested that improving access to clean water and sanitation reduces the risk of schistosomiasis transmission. Moreover, the use of soap, detergent, and endod (a berry sometimes used as a substitute for soap) might kill snails and the parasite larvae they excrete. We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis to study the association between people's access to clean water, sanitation, and good hygiene and the risk of schistosomiasis. People with access to clean water and adequate sanitation were at lower risks of schistosomiasis. No studies were found to explore the relationship between hygiene and risk of schistosomiasis. The difference in infection rates between people with and without access to clean water and sanitation varies widely between studies, suggesting that the impact of water and sanitation on schistosomiasis transmission is mediated by many other social and environmental factors. Further research is needed on the impact of water, sanitation and hygiene interventions for schistosomiasis control.
