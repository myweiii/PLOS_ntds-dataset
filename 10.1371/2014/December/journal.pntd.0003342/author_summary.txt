Carrion's disease, caused by Bartonella bacilliformis remains truly neglected due to its focal geographical nature. A wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic bacteremia can potentially lead to a spread of the disease into non-endemic regions. The PCR-based approach is sensitive for detection of B. bacilliformis but requires a thermocycler, thus limiting its use in remote endemic areas. LAMP is a simple method capable of detecting B. bacilliformis DNA within an hour under isothermal conditions, requiring less specialized equipment for amplification, thus enabling diagnosis in rural areas. This study demonstrated that the detection limit of LAMP, targeting the pap31 gene of B. bacilliformis, was comparable to that of qPCR. With a high, targeted selectivity, LAMP showed a high specificity as no cross-reaction was observed when testing a panel of closely related bacteria. The utility of the LAMP assay was further demonstrated by the examination of sand flies artificially fed on blood spiked with B. bacilliformis. The results showed that LAMP was able to detect B. bacilliformis in all flies confirmed positive by qPCR. This study showed that LAMP can be useful to support diagnosis of patients in low-resource settings and also to identify B. bacilliformis in the sand fly vector.
