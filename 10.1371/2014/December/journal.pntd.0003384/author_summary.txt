Chagas heart disease, stemming from infection by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is endemic in South America, is now present on five continents. The treatment now available for the clinically manifested heart disease is considered unsatisfactory. We postulate that manifestations of Chagas-like heart disease in a chicken model system refractory to T. cruzi infection might be prevented by killing the sick bone marrow cells of the recipient with anti-folate and cytostatic drugs, and transplanting healthy bone marrow cells from a syngeneic donor. We performed triplicate experiments in various groups of five chickens. Chickens hatched from T. cruzi-inoculated eggs, retaining the parasite mitochondrial kDNA in the genome, developed Chagas-like heart disease and died. The integration of T. cruzi kDNA minicircles into the chicken genome and the heritability of that integration were recorded, and the genetic underpinning of the autoimmune heart disease was demonstrated. Genome modifications in kDNA-mutated chickens led to disruption of immune tolerance and thus explained, for the first time, the rejection of the heart. Moreover, we found that killing the sick kDNA-mutated bone marrow cells with cytostatic and anti-folate drugs and transplanting healthy marrow cells inhibited heart rejection. These results suggest that bone marrow transplantation could be used to prevent Chagas heart failure.
