Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans, with an estimated 100 million cases annually. Being able to achieve early and correct detection of all four serotypes of dengue virus can have an impact on the diagnosis of individual patients, such as febrile travelers returning home, but can also be useful in endemic countries, particularly during the early stage of an outbreak. After analyzing all the complete genome sequences of dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 published in GenBank, we constructed a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay that can be used in different settings to detect dengue virus in clinical samples. Extensive evaluation of the performance of this assay by testing samples from dengue patients confirmed the usefulness of the method in detecting early stage infection. In short, our dengue virus RT-PCR proved to be a reliable diagnostic tool and a relevant alternative and/or complement to NS1 antigen-detecting tests and serological methods for diagnosis of acute dengue.
