This study largely relies on the biological database of the Institut Pasteur Medical Biology Laboratory, under the responsibility of Dr Berlioz-Arthaud (until Oct. 2007), Dr Guigon (Nov. 2007–Apr. 2009) and Dr Gourinat (since May 2009). The authors acknowledge the decisive commitment of the staff during outbreaks. New Caledonian meteorological data was kindly provided by Meteo France. This work is part of the deliverables of the working group “Predict” of GLEAN (Global Leptospirosis Environmental Action Network), which main purpose is to help countries in developing and implementing policies and tools for leptospirosis outbreak prediction. Thanks to Joe Lewnard (Yale) for helpful comments on the analyses.
