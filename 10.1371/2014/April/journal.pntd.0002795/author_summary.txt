Melioidosis is a problem in the developing tropical regions of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia where the Gram negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei can cause life-threatening infection. Diabetes mellitus is a recognised risk factor for melioidiosis; however little is known if commonly used anti-diabetic drugs may affect the clinical course of the disease. In this study, we found that patients who were receiving sulphonylureas for diabetic treatment had more severe septic complications requiring intensive care as well as increased risk of deaths. This may be attributable to the capacity of sulphonylureas in modulating the host immune response. We highlight caution in the prescription of this class of drug, which is popular due to its low cost and easy availability, especially in melioidosis-endemic tropical regions.
