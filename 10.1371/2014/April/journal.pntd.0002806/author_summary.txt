Most experiments on African trypanosomes - including those designed to look for new drugs - have studied parasites either from culture, or from laboratory rodents. We are interested in comparing these parasites that grow in man and domestic animals, where the parasites generally have different nutrient concentrations and much lower parasitaemias than in experimental models. The most accessible way to make the comparison is to measure the amounts of mRNAs. In this paper we describe how methods that are used to purify the parasites from human cells can change the relative amounts of mRNA. We also describe a method to examine RNA from relatively small numbers of parasites that are mixed with host cells.
