Leishmania amazonensis can induce a diversity of clinical manifestations in mammal hosts, including tegumentary and visceral leishmaniasis. The present study evaluated the variation of infectivity of L. amazonensis, which was pre-isolated from lesions of chronically infected mice and in vitro cultured for 150 days, in turn connecting these results with the profile of parasite protein expression using a proteomic approach. Parasites were recovered after the first passage, as well as after 50, 100, and 150 days of axenic cultures, and were subsequently evaluated. A total of 37 proteins presented a significant decrease, whereas 19 proteins presented a significant increase in their protein expression content in the assays (both cases >2.0 fold). Some of the identified proteins have been reported in prior literature, including diagnosis and/or vaccine candidates for leishmaniasis, while others proved to be involved in the infectivity of Leishmania. It is interesting to note that proteins related to the parasites' metabolism were also the majority of the proteins identified in the old cultures of L. amazonensis, suggesting a possible relation between the metabolic state of parasites and their possible loss of infectivity. In conclusion, the proteins identified in this study represent a contribution to the discovery of new vaccine candidates and/or immunotherapeutic targets against leishmaniasis.
