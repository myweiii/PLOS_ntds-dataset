The disease burden of Cryptosporidium parvum and role of zoonotic transmission in cryptosporidiosis epidemiology are poorly understood in developing countries. In this study, we examined the distribution and clinical manifestations of Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in HIV/AIDS patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Using molecular diagnostic tools, we detected Cryptosporidium infection in 26.9% of 520 HIV/AIDS patients studied. We have shown a very high diversity of Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in these patients, but unlike in other developing countries, C. parvum is overwhelmingly the dominant species in the study community, responsible for âˆ¼65% Cryptosporidium infections. The common occurrence of C. parvum zoonotic subtype family IIa, combined with calf contact as a significant risk factor, suggest that zoonotic transmission is important in cryptosporidiosis epidemiology in HIV/AIDS patients in Ethiopia. We have also shown that different Cryptosporidium species and subtypes are linked to different clinical manifestations. Improved hygiene and avoidance of calf contact should be advocated to reduce cryptosporidiosis transmission in HIV/AIDS patients in the study setting.
