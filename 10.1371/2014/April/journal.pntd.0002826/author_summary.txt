In this work, we propose a new screening strategy to produce monoclonal antibodies against Atr-I, a P-I class SVMP from Bothrops atrox, which is the snake responsible for the majority of the accidents in South America. SVMPs are the main toxic factors in Bothrops venom causing systemic and local hemorrhage, which may evolve to inflammation and/or necrosis. Since the toxic effects of SVMPs are related to their proteolytic activity, we have produced a peptide which was used as a biosensor for Atr-I hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of this substrate was monitored and the clones possessing inhibitory activity against the proteolytic activity of Atr-I upon the peptide were selected. Using our new approach, we have obtained four monoclonal antibodies highly specific and with neutralizing capacity against the hemorrhagic activity of either Atr-I alone or Bothrops atrox whole venom. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time where a functional screening is used for the selection of neutralizing mAbs against SVMPs. It is also the first description of mAbs anti-Atr-I, with inhibitory potential against its toxic activities which may be useful for diagnosis and treatment in the future.
