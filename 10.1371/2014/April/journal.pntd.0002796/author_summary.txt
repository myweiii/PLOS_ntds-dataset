Plasmodium vivax causes tens of millions of malaria cases each year. Although some vaccines against P. vivax are being developed, little is known about the geospatial genetic diversity and selective constraints of the parasite surface antigens that these vaccines target. In order to create vaccines that are both efficacious and useful in diverse regions of the world, the strain diversity of these potential vaccine targets must be well understood. Specifically, we must understand whether and how the human immune system develops immunity against these antigens as well as understanding whether these antigens are similar in geographically diverse parasite populations. Here, using next-generation sequencing and population-genetic analyses, we found evidence of likely immune selection in specific regions of two leading vivax vaccine candidate antigens, PvMSP-1 and PvCSP. At the pvmsp-1 locus, we also found more genetic variability within populations than between populations, with some DNA sequences from geographically diverse populations being highly similar. In contrast, pvcsp sequences from geographically diverse populations are very distinct from one another, with specific sequence patterns occurring in certain geographic regions. Our findings provide new insights into the geographic genetic diversity of these two antigens and can help inform the development of effective P. vivax vaccines.
