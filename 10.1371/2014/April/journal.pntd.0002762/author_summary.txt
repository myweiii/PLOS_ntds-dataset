Lymphatic filariasis afflicts over 120 million people worldwide. While the infection is mostly clinically asymptomatic, approximately 40 million people suffer from overt, morbid clinical pathology, characterized by swelling of the scrotal area and lower limbs (hydrocele and lymphedema). Host immunologic factors that influence the pathogenesis of disease in these individuals are not completely understood. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are known to play a role in promoting pathogenesis through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while IL-10 is known to play an important role in dampening inflammation. IL-10 belongs to a family of cytokines that include IL-19, IL-24 and IL-26, known as the IL-10 superfamily. We investigated whether these cytokines have a function similar to IL-10 in individuals with asymptomatic infection and no clinical pathology and those with overt, clinical pathology. We first identify that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produce these cytokines. We next identify a significant association of IL-19 and IL-24 secreting T cells with asymptomatic infection. IL-26 secreting T cells, in contrast, appear to be significantly associated with the presence of lymphatic pathology in filarial infection. Therefore, we have uncovered a potentially new regulatory pathway involving the IL-10 superfamily cytokines in filarial infections.
