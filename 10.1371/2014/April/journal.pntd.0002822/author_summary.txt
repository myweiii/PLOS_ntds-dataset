Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a non-invasive pathogen causing diarrhea in children as well as in adults and travelers in developing countries. After colonizing the intestine using colonization factors, the organisms secrete heat-stable (ST) and/or heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin to cause watery diarrhea. Natural infection with ETEC provides protection against subsequent infection; however, the precise mechanism is unknown. In this study, we have shown that adult patients with diarrhea infected with ETEC develop toxin (LTB) and colonization factor (CFA/I and CS6) specific memory B cell responses as well as highly avid antigen-specific antibodies. The antibody avidity indices were shown to be positively associated with memory B cell responses, suggesting that these processes may occur in concert. This study encourages further evaluation of such responses in children as well as in vaccinees.
