Buruli ulcer is a skin disease caused by inoculation of Mycobacterium ulcerans bacteria, which is emerging in tropical countries. Lesions typically start as nodules, which eventually open to form progressive, non-healing wounds. Although anti-mycobacterial antibiotics are efficient at stopping the infection, ulcers often persist after completion of treatment for reasons that remain unclear. In the present study, we performed a quantitative analysis of a large array of proteins circulating in peripheral blood, with the view to identifying biomarkers of disease progression and wound chronicity. We found that Buruli ulcer disease induces a unique signature of serum protein suppression that outlasts the elimination of bacteria. Interestingly, the initial levels of several of these proteins differed between fast and slow healers, suggesting an association with healing defects. Our results unravel an unexpected feature of Buruli ulcer disease and show that M. ulcerans infection has global and durable effects on the host's protein metabolism.
