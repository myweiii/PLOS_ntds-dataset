A 24 month vaccine trial was conducted using 103 leishmania free dogs in an area of southeast Iran endemic for visceral leishmaniosis. The dogs were vaccinated with gentamicin-attenuated line of Leishmania infantum. No local and/or general indications of disease were observed in the vaccinated dogs immediately after vaccination with an attenuated line of Leishmania infantum. Nine out of 31 (29%) unvaccinated dogs, but none of those vaccinated, were positive for presence of Leishmania DNA by PCR. In western blots, sera from 10 out of 31 (32.2%) unvaccinated dogs, but none of the sera from vaccinated dogs, recognized the 21 kDa antigen of Leishmania infantum wild-type. One out of 46 (2.2%) vaccinated dogs and 9 out of 31 (29%) unvaccinated dogs developed clinical signs of disease. The attenuated Leishmania infantum induced a significant and strong protective effect against Leishmania infantum infection in the field.
