Sand flies transmit Leishmania parasites during bloodfeeding. Salivary molecules are deposited alongside parasites and can reshape the host's immune response to infection. Exposure to uninfected sand fly bites or immunization with salivary molecules protects the host against Leishmania infection. Here we show that mice exposed to bites of uninfected Phlebotomus duboscqi sand flies are protected against P. duboscqi-transmitted L. major and characterize the formerly unknown early cellular infiltrate at the bite site following L.major vector-transmission. The kinetics and nature of the inflammatory response at the bite site of exposed mice were notably different from those of naïve mice showing an amplified expression of cytokines and chemokines after parasite transmission. The transcripts reflected a faster and more robust infiltrate of immune cells to the bite site of exposed mice composed of neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, NK cells and CD4+ T cells. In addition, there was an increased influx of activated IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cells and Granzyme B-producing mature NK cells in exposed animals. These findings suggest that the observed robust and persistent proinflammatory response in exposed animals restrict parasite multiplication.
