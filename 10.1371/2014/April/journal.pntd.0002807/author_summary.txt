Schistosoma haematobium is a blood fluke that causes severe urogenital pathology and affects millions of people, mainly in sub-Sahara Africa. Current diagnosis is based on microscopic examination of urine samples, but this method is not only observer dependent, but also known for its low sensitivity and high day-to-day variability. Accurate diagnosis is important to assess community levels of infections for consideration of deworming campaigns, and to monitor treatment efficacy. We evaluated a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for specific detection and quantification of Schistosoma DNA in urine samples from 114 preselected S. haematobium infected schoolchildren of endemic coastal Kenya and compared the outcome to several other diagnostic methods. Three urine samples collected over three subsequent days from 24 participants were used for Analyzing day-to-day fluctuations in egg counts and Schistosoma DNA levels. Urine was also tested two and 18 months after praziquantel treatment. Compared to microscopy, we observed less day-to-day fluctuations and higher sensitivity with real-time PCR, in particular when tested two months after therapy. Real-time PCR is therefore useful for more accurate identification of S. haematobium, especially in monitoring control interventions.
