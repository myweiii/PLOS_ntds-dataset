Viruses like West Nile, dengue and Japanese encephalitis are responsible for large number of human and livestock diseases worldwide. These viruses, transmitted by female mosquitoes via saliva during blood-feeding, elicit an immune response in these mosquitoes. The details of this immune response are still being investigated. Dicer2, which has previously been shown to be involved in RNAi mediated antiviral activity in mosquitoes, contains helicase domain, which leads to activation of antiviral protein, Vago. Vago is functionally similar to mammalian interferon and after secretion activates Jak-STAT pathway in neighboring cells leading to antiviral effect. Here we demonstrate that sensing of viral RNA by Dicer2 leads to activation of TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF), which in turn leads to cleavage and release of amino-terminal domain of Rel2, NF-κB ortholog. Rel2 binds to a conserved NF-κB binding site on Vago promoter region leading to its induction. This proposed mechanism of Vago activation is similar to mammalian interferon activation after viral infection. The identification of this novel and evolutionarily conserved pathway downstream of Dicer2 provides new insight into the immune signalling in mosquitoes and other invertebrates.
