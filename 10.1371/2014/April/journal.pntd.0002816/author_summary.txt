Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is of a higher clinical importance as an opportunistic infection in individuals infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus type-1) in areas where both infections are endemic. Co-infected patients classically present a chronic clinical course, with high rates of treatment failure and relapse. Differences in the clinical presentation of VL between HIV-infected and uninfected patients and the factors related to an unfavorable outcome remain rarely studied. In this work, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with VL were compared according to HIV infection status, and the main determinants of a poor outcome at 6 months were identified.
