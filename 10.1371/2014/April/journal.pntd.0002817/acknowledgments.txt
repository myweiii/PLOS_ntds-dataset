We gratefully thank the population of Diokhor Tack and the village chief, Daoure Mbaye, for their hospitality and participation in this study. This study would not have been possible without the field workers in Richard Toll, Abdoulaye Yague, Mankeur Diop, Moussa Wade and Ngary Sy, who assisted in the blood sample collection and microscopic analysis and the support of the medical and technical staff of the Health Centre in Richard Toll. The authors would also like to thank Ann Bamford for help in preparation of schistosome E/S material at the University of York.
