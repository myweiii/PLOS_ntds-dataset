Infection by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes sleeping sickness, also called human African trypanosomiasis. Without treatment, the disease is fatal yet current therapeutic options are inadequate and better medicines are needed. We have previously reported several potent inhibitors of T. brucei methionyl-tRNA synthetase, an essential enzyme involved in the protein biosynthesis. Recently, a new series of the inhibitors was synthesized which has improved membrane permeability over the earlier inhibitors. When applied to mouse with T. brucei infection, the new compounds are orally available and reach the central nervous system to reduce parasite loads, and therefore are promising molecules to be developed into antitrypanosomal drug. Here, more inhibitors from this series are reported and tested for their activities. High resolution crystal structures were determined that revealed how these inhibitors bind to the target enzyme. The binding pockets of these inhibitors are thoroughly explored, providing profound insights which are beneficial for further development of MetRS inhibitors against sleeping sickness. A ternary complex of the enzyme, an inhibitor, and an ATP analogue was also determined, indicates that the inhibitor does not compete with ATP for binding. Based on this, a general approach to use inhibitors that engage ATP for binding to tRNA synthetases is proposed.
