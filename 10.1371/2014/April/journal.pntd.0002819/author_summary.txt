Pneumonia and sepsis are conditions in which a procoagulant state is observed, with activation of coagulation and downregulation of anticoagulant pathways, both closely interrelated with inflammation. The protein C (PC) system is an important anticoagulant pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. After binding to thrombomodulin (TM), PC is converted into active protein C (APC), mediated via high-affinity binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin (TM) and further augmented via association of the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) to the TM-thrombin complex. We studied the role of TM-associated PC-activation during the host response during pneumonia-derived sepsis caused by Burkholderia (B.) pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, a common form of community-acquired Gram-negative (pneumo)sepsis in South-East Asia and a serious potential bioterrorism threat agent. Mice with an impaired capacity to activate protein C displayed a worse survival upon infection with B. pseudomallei, accompanied by increased coagulation activation, enhanced lung neutrophil influx and bronchoalveolar inflammation at late time points, together with increased hepatocellular injury. These data further expand the knowledge about the role of the protein C system during melioidosis and may be of value in the development of therapeutic strategies against this dangerous pathogen.
