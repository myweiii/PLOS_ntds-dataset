    "Background": "During severe (pneumo)sepsis inflammatory and coagulation pathways become activated as part of the host immune response. Thrombomodulin (TM) is involved in a range of host defense mechanisms during infection and plays a pivotal role in activation of protein C (PC) into active protein C (APC). APC has both anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study we investigated the effects of impaired TM-mediated APC generation during melioidosis, a common form of community-acquired Gram-negative (pneumo)sepsis in South-East Asia caused by Burkholderia (B.) pseudomallei.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "(WT) mice and mice with an impaired capacity to activate protein C due to a point mutation in their Thbd gene (TMpro/pro mice) were intranasally infected with B. pseudomallei and sacrificed after 24, 48 or 72 hours for analyses. Additionally, survival studies were performed. When compared to WT mice, TMpro/pro mice displayed a worse survival upon infection with B. pseudomallei, accompanied by increased coagulation activation, enhanced lung neutrophil influx and bronchoalveolar inflammation at late time points, together with increased hepatocellular injury. The TMpro/pro mutation had limited if any impact on bacterial growth and dissemination.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "TM-mediated protein C activation contributes to protective immunity after infection with B. pseudomallei. These results add to a better understanding of the regulation of the inflammatory and procoagulant response during severe Gram-negative (pneumo)sepsis."
