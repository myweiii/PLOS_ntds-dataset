Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are preferred because they have the capacity to treat a range of viral illnesses rather than just one. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of antiviral drugs to treat neglected tropical diseases is difficult to obtain due to ethical and logistical considerations when conducting human clinical trials. Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an endemic tropical disease that causes human morbidity and mortality, as well as economic damage to the livestock industry. There are no licensed antiviral drugs to treat RVF. In this study, we found that a novel anti-influenza drug, Favipiravir (T-705), is able to prevent lethal RVF in rats, and therefore shows promise as a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment.
