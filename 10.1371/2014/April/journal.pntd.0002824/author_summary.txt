Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease due to the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. It affects more than 37 million people worldwide, most of them (99%) living in Africa. The control of river blindness is, up to now, based on annual or six-monthly mass treatment with ivermectin. This drug kills O. volvulus microfilariae (mf) present in the skin and the eyes and prevents for 3–4 months the release of new mf by female worms (embryostatic effect). In Ghana, after 10–19 years of repeated treatments, the emergence of adult parasite populations not responding as expected to ivermectin was postulated. In this study, the reproductive status of female worms was compared, just before and 80 days after ivermectin treatment, between frequently treated and ivermectin-naïve cohorts from Cameroon. In both groups, embryogenesis of O. volvulus was not affected by ivermectin. However, the accumulation of microfilariae (mf) in the females uteri expected after ivermectin was less marked in the frequently treated population, suggesting that the temporary sequestration of mf following treatment may have been weakened in this group. After 13 years of repeated annual treatments, the embryostatic effect of ivermectin on O. volvulus still occurs but the present findings, associated with observations of higher rates of skin repopulation by mf in the same individuals, suggest that this effect has been decreased.
