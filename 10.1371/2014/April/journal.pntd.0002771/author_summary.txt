A largely automated methodology is described for creating models that use past and recent data to predict dengue incidence levels several weeks in advance for a specific time period and a geographic region that can be sub-national. The input data include historical and recent dengue incidence, socioeconomic factors, and remotely sensed variables related to weather, climate, and the environment. Among the climate variables are those known to indicate future weather patterns that may or may not be seasonal. The final prediction models adhere to these principles: 1) the data used must be available at the time the prediction is made (avoiding pitfalls made by studies that use recent data that, in actual practice, would not be available until after the date the prediction was made); and 2) the models are tested on data not used in their development (thereby avoiding overly optimistic measures of accuracy of the prediction). Local public health preferences for low numbers of false positives and negatives are taken into account. These models appear to be robust even when applied to nearby geographic regions that were not used in model development. The method may be applied to other vector borne and environmentally affected diseases.
