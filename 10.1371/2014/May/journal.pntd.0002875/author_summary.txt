The co-infection of VL and HIV is a very challenging clinical problem especially in the East-Africa region. Though liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended treatment option for VL-HIV co-infection, it is often not available in practice in Ethiopia. Thus several patients are still being treated with antimonials that are infamous for their toxicity. In this study, we describe the results of such antimonial treatment in a series of 57 patients. The effectiveness of antimonials was found to be low and, in comparison to previous studies, declining. There is an urgent need to assure the availability of safer and more effective alternative medications for VL-HIV. It seems also wise to start a surveillance scheme for drug susceptibility in leishmania parasites as our results may relate to emerging antimonial resistance in the East-Africa region.
