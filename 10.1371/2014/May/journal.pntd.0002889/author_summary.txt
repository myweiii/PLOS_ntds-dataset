Malaria and lymphatic filariasis are two of the most important mosquito-borne parasitic diseases worldwide, which can occur as concomitant human infections. The Anopheles sinensis mosquito is the most common malaria and lymphatic filariasis vector in Southeast Asia. Disease-vector control is an important part of the global malaria and filariasis control strategies. Pyrethroid insecticides are the major vector control agents, and rotational or combinational use with other classes of insecticides has been proposed to mitigate the problem of pyrethroid resistance. Therefore, assessing resistance to multiple classes of insecticides is important because vector control programs may not be effective, or even fail, if mosquito vectors are already resistant to the insecticides being used in rotation or combination. The field populations of An. sinensis mosquito from central China (Anhui) and southern China (Yunnan) developed high resistance to four classes of insecticides tested, including pyrethroids (deltamethrin and permethrin), organochlorine (DDT), organophosphate (malathion), and carbamate (bendiocarb). This study examined two questions: 1) the consequences of long-term insecticide rotation use on insecticide resistance, and 2) the role of metabolic detoxification and target site insensitivity in resistance to chemical insecticides. The information obtained from this investigation is valuable in informing current and future vector control strategies.
