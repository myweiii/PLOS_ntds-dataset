The unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi infects humans, leading to Chagas disease, endemic in Central and South America and responsible for 13,000 annual deaths. Only two drugs have proven effective against Chagas, nifurtimox and benznidazole (Bzn). Bzn has the best safety and efficacy profiles and is thus used as first line treatment. Bzn is a pro-drug, and possesses a nitro group which needs to be enzymatically reduced within the parasite to become active. We have investigated for the first time, by means of mass spectrometry based metabolomics, the global changes to small metabolites that occur once Bzn enters the parasite. A decrease in the levels of several thiols, including cysteine and trypanothione, and an increase in gamma-glutamyl containing dipeptides were observed after treatment. Reduced metabolites of Bzn were also detected, together with numerous covalent conjugates of the drug combined with low molecular weight thiols and some non-thiol metabolites. Overall, Bzn treatment primarily affects thiol containing molecules in T. cruzi, and this interference with thiol metabolism contributes to the drug's mode of action.
