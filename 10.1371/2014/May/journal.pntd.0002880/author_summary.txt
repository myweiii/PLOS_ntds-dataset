Soil-transmitted helminths are carried by large numbers of people in developing countries. These parasites live in the gut and may interact with bacterial communities in the gut, also called the gut microbiota. To determine whether there are alterations to the gut microbiota that are associated with helminth infections, we examined the types of bacteria present in fecal samples from rural Malaysians, many of whom are helminth-positive and find it likely that helminth colonization alters the gut microbiota for rural Malaysians.
