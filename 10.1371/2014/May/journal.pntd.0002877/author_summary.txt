Melioidosis is a severe bacterial infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei with a high case-fatality rate. Epidemiological and animal studies show the possibility of inhalation transmission. However, no B. pseudomallei concentrations in ambient air have been researched. Here, we successfully developed a method to quantify ambient B. pseudomallei by using a filter/real-time qPCR method. Twenty-four hour samples were collected every day from June 11 to December 21, 2012 including during the typhoon season (June to September) and reference season (October to December) in the Zoynan Region in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing concentrations of B. pseudomallei in ambient air. For the typhoons affecting the Zoynan Region, the positive rates of ambient B. pseudomallei were very high. Our data imply the possibility of air transmission of Melioidosis during the typhoon season. In addition, ambient B. pseudomallei aerosolized from sediment of a nearby lake should be a concern as an important source of transmission. Our results could provide deeper insight into Melioidosis transmissibility and infection control.
