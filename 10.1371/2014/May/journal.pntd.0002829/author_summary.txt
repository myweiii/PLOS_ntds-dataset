Giardia lamblia is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea across the globe. The disease can result in fatalities especially in small children. The parasite is transmitted by contaminated food through faeco-oral route due to unhygienic habits. The parasite exhibits two stages during its lifecycle; namely cysts and trophozoites. Due to their environmentally resistant hardy nature cysts are transmitted through contaminated food into the human body. Upon entry into the human body they convert into active trophozoites and cause pathogenesis of the disease. In the course of infection within the host, some of the trophozoites convert back into cysts and are released in the environment through the faeces. The mechanisms and signals that convert the parasite from trophozoites to cysts are not yet known. Our study, for the first time, implicates heat shock protein 90 of the parasite in the conversion of trophozoites into cysts in the intestine of the infected human body. Hsp90 is famous for its ability to sense environmental changes and provide cues for stage-switch in related parasites. In addition to providing a glimpse into molecular mechanisms of stage inter-conversion, our results suggest potential new ways of treating this important human infection.
