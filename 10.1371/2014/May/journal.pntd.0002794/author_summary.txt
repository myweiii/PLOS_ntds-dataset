In recent years, a number of new strategies using novel technologies for the control of dengue fever control have emerged. These strategies are notably different from their predecessors and not without controversy. Many also require open release field trials to test their efficacy. Public consultation and engagement are recognized as critical to the future success of these programs, but questions remain regarding how to proceed. In this paper we describe an approach to public engagement that uses social research to design an engagement framework and communication materials tailored to the concerns, expectations, and socio-political setting of potential trial release sites. This approach was developed and implemented in Australia (2008–2010) where the first publicly supported field trials occurred January 2011. We report here on the implementation of this approach in Vietnam (2009–2010) where the second release will occur in 2014. This paper describes the process, research activities, outcomes and key findings from the Vietnamese field site. It highlights key public concerns and expectations about engagement and authorization and shows how these were used to develop a more targeted, culturally appropriate and comprehensible engagement framework and communication materials. The paper demonstrates the viability of this approach to community engagement for new dengue control strategies, in a ‘developing’ country context.
