Understanding the awareness of the community on non-malaria febrile illnesses is crucial, especially during the recent decline of malaria episodes of malaria. This study conducted focus group discussions with communities to assess their awareness of non-malaria febrile illnesses. In addition, in-depth interviews with health workers were conducted to explore their views and practices related to diagnosis and management of these illnesses. We identified that the awareness of the study participants on non-malaria febrile illnesses was low and the majority believed that most instances of fever are due to malaria. Moreover, the participants could not mention the right causes of fever and many had inappropriate beliefs about possible causes of fever. Health workers from our study looked for non-malaria febrile illnesses when a febrile patient had negative mRDT result or there was persistence of fever following completion of anti-malarial dosage. Shortages of diagnostic facilities were identified as one of the impediments to proper diagnosis of febrile illnesses. These findings indicate the need for creation of public awareness on causes of fever other than malaria. We recommend appropriate measures be taken by the government and other stake holders to improve health care services delivery particularly at primary health care facilities.
