Leprosy is one of the six diseases considered by WHO as a major threat in developing countries and often results in severe, life-long disabilities and deformities due to delayed diagnosis. Early detection of Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) infection, followed by effective interventions, is considered vital to interrupt transmission. Thus, field-friendly tests that detect asymptomatic M. leprae infection are urgently required. The clinical outcome after M. leprae infection is determined by the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies in response to M. leprae. In this study, we developed lateral flow assays (LFA) for detection of pro-inflammatory (IP-10) vs. anti-inflammatory/regulatory (IL-10) cellular immunity as well as antibodies against M. leprae and evaluated these in a field setting in Ethiopia using lightweight, portable readers. We show that detection of IP-10 allowed a significant reduction of the overall test-to-result time from 24 h to 6 h. Moreover, IP-10/IL-10 ratios in unstimulated plasma differed significantly between patients and EC, which can provide means to identify M. leprae infection. Thus, the LFAs are low-tech, robust assays that can be applied in resource-poor settings measuring immunity to M. leprae and can be used as tools for early diagnosis of leprosy leading to timely treatment and reduced transmission.
