Meningococcal meningitis (MM) is a severe infection of the meninges caused by a bacterium transmitted through respiratory droplets. During January–May, epidemics of MM recurrently strike sub-Saharan countries, including Niger. Understanding why epidemics occur in a particular place at a particular time would help public health authorities to develop more efficient prevention strategies. To date, factors that govern the occurrence of localized outbreaks are still poorly understood and epidemics remain unpredictable. In this retrospective study (2004–2010), we developed a statistical model in order to investigate the influence of various factors (climatic, demographic, epidemiologic, etc.) on the annual incidence of MM serogroup A at a fine spatial scale (the health centre catchment area) in Niger. We found that mean relative humidity and occurrence of early rains were protective climatic factors and that a higher risk was associated with the presence of a road, the percentage of neighbouring areas having cases and the occurrence of early cases before January. These findings contribute to improve our understanding of MM epidemics in Africa and the associated factors, and might be used in the future for the subsequent development of an early warning system.
