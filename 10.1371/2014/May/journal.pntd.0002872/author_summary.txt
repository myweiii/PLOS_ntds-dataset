Scabies is a skin infection caused by parasitic scabies mites. There are an estimated 300 million cases globally, with the majority of infections occurring in the world's poorest communities. In Australia, scabies is common in remote Indigenous communities where the infection rate is 16 times higher than the non-Indigenous population. Current treatments have remained relatively unchanged for years and consequently treatment resistance has inevitability emerged. Despite scabies being a well known and frequent infectious skin disease, scabies research has been neglected, resulting in a lack of basic scabies mite biological data. As a result no new therapeutics have been developed. Our research seeks to understand the relationship between the parasite and the human host and one key area of interest is how mites avoid destruction and survive in human skin. We have determined that to survive an attack by the skin's immune defence system the mites release counter defensive proteins that inhibit the skin's defences from activating. This strategy allows the mites to survive in the skin, reproduce and to establish an infection. With this information we can design therapeutics that target these mite proteins, allow the skin to mount an attack and potentially reduce infection.
