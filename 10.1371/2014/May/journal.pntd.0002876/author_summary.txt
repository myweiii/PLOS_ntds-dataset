Sarcocystis species are protozoan organisms that have been associated with disease in animals but less frequently so in humans. Following a retreat on Pangkor Island off Peninsular Malaysia, a number of persons presented to our hospital with prolonged fever and muscle pain that was initially difficult to attribute to a known infectious cause. Investigations, including muscle biopsies and PCR, showed that this outbreak was most likely due to Sarcocystis nesbitti infection. The most common clinical features were fever and myalgia that was relapsing-remitting in more than half the patients. Some patients had visible swelling of muscle groups, including of the face, with magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrating inflammation in these muscles. Herein, we present the clinical and investigation findings in 89 symptomatic persons in the largest reported outbreak of human muscular sarcocystosis to date. Our findings provide insights and suggestions for the most appropriate forms of investigation, treatment and possible source of infection.
