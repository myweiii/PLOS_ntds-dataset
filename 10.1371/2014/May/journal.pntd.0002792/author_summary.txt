Strongyloidiasis is one of the most neglected helminthic infections and can cause disseminated disease in immunocompromised hosts, which can be fatal. Given the unsatisfactory results of current parasitological and serological tests, there is a need for more efficient diagnostic tools. Therefore we have used phage display technology and bioppaning procedure to select sensitive and specific mimotopes ready to be used in immunodiagnostic tests. These mimotopes allows a cheap and fast clear-cut diagnosis of Strongyloides stercoralis infections. The field applicability of the assay using the phage clones obtained is really promising. The main advantage is that phage-based ELISA is the reproducible, simple, rapid and low-cost for production of recombinant antigens, and such tests may be of interest for massive screening in developing countries. Our results indicate that the mimotopes selected and tested here are potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of human strongyloidiasis.
