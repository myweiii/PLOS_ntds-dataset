In a parasitic relationship, both host and parasite genotypes influence the parameters of their relationship. Previous studies examining host-parasite systems have examined the effects of the genotype of the host or the parasite on the relationship, but due to limitations of technology, have rarely examined interactions between the two genotypes. Here, we utilized a dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach to examine the entirety of the known transcriptomes and their interactions in the dynamic process of filarial worm development in the mosquito. In addition, the unprecedented sequencing depth achieved with this technology allowed us to compare, for the first time, parasite gene expression of larval developmental stages within the intermediate host with those life cycle stages found within the mammalian definitive host. These data provide a strong foundation for understanding how Brugia malayi interacts with its vector's transcriptome temporally during its complex life cycle and also simultaneously provides information on how Aedes aegypti responds to filarial worm infection. These data are extremely valuable for future studies of the underlying mechanisms of this mosquito-filarial worm relationship.
