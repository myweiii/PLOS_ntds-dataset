Since it was first described more than a century ago, the question as to whether the protistan parasite Blastocystis causes disease or is a commensal of the human gut still remains unresolved. Strain- or subtype-dependent variability in Blastocystis pathogenicity has been proposed to contribute to this controversy. Currently, the factors determining this variation are unknown. For seven strains from two clinically relevant Blastocystis subtypes, we evaluated their ability to adhere to human intestinal epithelium and to disturb barrier function. We showed that the more adhesive strains exhibited greater pathogenicity. We also observed an inverse correlation between adhesiveness and drug resistance, suggesting that drug resistance might compromise the fitness of the parasite. This is the first study highlighting the important role of adhesion in Blastocystis pathogenesis. We conclude that the extensive variation in Blastocystis pathogenicity is a plausible factor contributing to the disparate outcomes of Blastocystis infections.
