The species of the Paracoccidioides genus, a neglected human pathogen, represent the causative agents of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), one of the most frequent systemic mycoses in Latin America. Despite being phagocytosed, the fungus conidia differentiate into the parasitic yeast form that subverts the normally harsh intraphagosomal environment and survives and replicates into murine and human macrophages. It has been suggested that alternative carbon metabolism plays a role in the survival and virulence of Paracoccidioides spp. within host cells. We used large-scale transcriptome and proteome approaches to better characterize the responses of Paracoccidioides, Pb01, yeast parasitic cells, to carbon starvation. We aimed to identify important molecules used by the fungus to adapt to these hostile conditions. The shift to a starvation mode, including gluconeogenesis and ethanol increases, activation of fatty acids, and amino acid degradation are the strategies used by the pathogen to persist under this stress. Our study provides a detailed map of Paracoccidioides spp. responses under carbon starvation conditions and contributes to further investigations of the importance of alternative carbon adaptation during fungus pathogenesis.
