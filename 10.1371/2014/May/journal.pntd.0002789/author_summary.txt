Demographic, economic and behavioural factors are important to successful control of dengue. This study aimed to examine these factors and their association with the prevalence rate of dengue in a community marked by IgG seropositivity of students attending schools there, as assessed in our previous study. Telephone interviewing was used to try to reach the households in a 3 km radius of the schools where serological tests were conducted. Results showed three major correlates of the presence of IgG seropositivity in the community: (1) high-rise residential apartment house type or condominium buildings; (2) the main construct of the HBM, perceived severity and susceptibility; and (3) the additional constructs of the HBM, lack of preventive measures at the community level and having a neighbour with dengue as a cue to action. The residential environment factor and the constructs of the HBM are useful and important elements in developing interventions to prevent and control dengue.
