Human leishmaniasis is caused by unicellular parasites that are injected into the skin by sand-flies, small, flying insects. Many different Leishmania species cause various manifestations of disease, both of the skin and internal organs. Leishmaniasis is a curable disease but clear guidelines on the best available treatment are lacking. Leishmania species differ in sensitivity to available drugs. Until recently, identification of the infecting Leishmania parasite was laborious, thus therapy could not precisely be targeted to the infecting species, in contrast to many other infectious diseases. Nowadays, Leishmania parasites can be identified relatively easily with new DNA techniques. We studied efficacy of therapies for diseases due to different Leishmania species, limited to the English literature. Efficacy was summarized and presented in an easy to read format. Because of difficulties with identification of parasite species in earlier studies, quality of evidence was often limited. Our findings are a major help for clinicians to easily find optimal treatment for specific patients. Moreover, our results demonstrate where additional research is needed to further improve treatment of leishmaniasis.
