Cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis are part of the group we call neglected diseases. They are serious conditions that afflict millions in vast regions of the world. These diseases are very difficult to treat. This is due to the scanty choice of effective drugs together with their potentially severe side effects. One way of finding new treatments for these neglected conditions is to repurpose drugs that are already in use to treat other diseases. In this paper, we show that raloxifene, a drug that is used for the treatment of osteoporosis and also as an alternative in the treatment of breast cancer, is active against the causative agents of leishmaniasis and is effective in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in an experimental model. We also show that the antileishmanial mechanism of action of raloxifene is related to damage to the cell membrane and to the mitochondrion of the parasite.
