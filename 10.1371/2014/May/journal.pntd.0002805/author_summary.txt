As dengue virus transmission is through a human-to-mosquito-to-human cycle, the influence of meteorological factors on dengue is likely to be associated with their impact on mosquito populations and behavior. Other than the influence of weather factors, the shift of dominant serotypes and pre-emptive measures taken against dengue vectors may possibly affect the dengue transmission trend. In this study, we investigate the impact of weather factors on dengue in tropical Singapore, taking into consideration the disease epidemiology and profile of virus serotypes. We found that absolute humidity, as a composite index of mean temperature and relative humidity, is a more stable and better predictor for modeling dengue incidence than the other unique weather variables when virological factors are taken into consideration. This research suggests that absolute humidity needs to be considered together with all the other contributing factors in order to make meaningful public policy recommendations for dengue control.
