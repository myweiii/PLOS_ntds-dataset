Chagas disease prevention depends on the control of its insect vectors — large blood-sucking bugs called triatomines. One commonly neglected problem of vector studies is imperfect detection, whereby some sites are mistakenly classified as uninfested. We address this drawback by combining repeated sampling of ‘ecotopes’ (houses, fowl-houses, corrals, woodpiles, etc.) with models that accommodate detection failures to study habitat selection by a major vector, Triatoma brasiliensis. Triatoma brasiliensis was strongly associated with peridomestic rodents and goats/sheep. We found little support to the conventional view that T. brasiliensis prefers stone-like habitats; at least in our study setting, host availability was much more important than ecotope structure, and, overall, wooden habitats (timber piles or wood-fenced corrals) were slightly favored. The risk of infestation in any individual ecotope increased when another ecotope in the same dwelling was also infested; this increase was the same for houses and for peridomestic structures. These findings suggest that management of peridomestic animals, and especially rodents and goats, could help mitigate the risk of dwelling and house infestation by T. brasiliensis. In sum, our study demonstrates how relatively simple but sound sampling and analytical approaches can critically enhance our understanding of disease ecology by explicitly accounting for imperfect detection.
