Leishmaniasis is still a major health problem in some endemic foci, yet no vaccine is available against any form of leishmaniasis. It is a general belief that recovery from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is accompanied with long life protection. An inoculation of live pathogenic L. major into healthy individuals to induce lesion similar to CL is called Leishmanization (LZ). Historically LZ showed to be the most effective control tool against CL. One of the drawbacks and reason for discontinuation of LZ was lesion development, which rarely lasts long. Treatment of CL is not an easy task. One line of development of an effective vaccine against leishmaniasis, a transgenic strain of L. major harboring two suicide genes tk and cd genes (lmtkcd+/+), was developed and previously checked in BALB/c mice. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with transgenic lmtkcd+/+strain; the rate of protection, parasite burden and the type of immune response were checked, and the results showed that complete protection induced by inoculation of lmtkcd+/+strain if treatment is initiated on day 8 post inoculation.
