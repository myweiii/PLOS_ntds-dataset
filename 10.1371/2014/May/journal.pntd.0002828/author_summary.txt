Studies evaluating the ability of the killed bivalent whole cell oral cholera vaccine, Shanchol, to elicit an immune response have been performed in historically cholera-endemic areas of Asia. There is a need to assess whether the vaccine is able to elicit an immune response in Haiti and other populations without historical exposure to cholera. In this study, we measure immune responses after administration of Shanchol, in 25 adults, 51 older children (6–17 years), and 47 younger children (1–5 years) in Haiti, where cholera was introduced in 2010. A killed bivalent whole cell oral cholera vaccine (Shanchol) is capable of inducing an immune response in adults and children living in Haiti. However, a two-dose regimen may be important in Haiti and other populations lacking historical exposure to cholera.
