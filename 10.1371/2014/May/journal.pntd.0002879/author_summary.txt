Buruli ulcer, caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), is a severe skin disease occurring in tropical and subtropical countries. Strongly associated to freshwater ecosystems and especially swampy and flooded areas, transmission of this bacterium within ecosystems and across multiple aquatic organisms is still an enigma. Here, we studied in depth the temporal and spatial variations of MU presence in freshwater ecosystems and aquatic organisms in two areas of Cameroon where Buruli ulcer is endemic. We found MU widely present across ecosystems and taxonomic groups along the year and we described a general trend for MU persistence in the environment. Moreover, the colonization dynamics of aquatic ecosystems suggest that each kind of ecosystem may have distinct favourable times of the year for MU presence. In addition to setting the scene for a preventive approach for humans based on ecosystem characteristics, this study suggests that MU transmission is the result of complex ecological processes between biotic and environmental factors. Such results call for an integrative approach in order to disentangle the respective contributions of aquatic organisms and environmental conditions on MU presence and persistence in the environment.
