A retrospective study on the incidence of acute schistosomiasis in the People's Republic of China (P.R. China) was performed, in order to assess the new integrated control strategy that was implemented through the national control program from 2005 to 2012. The lake and marshland regions have been identified as high risk areas as shown by the nine spatio-temporal clusters that we found in the transmission period between June and November each year. When a total of 1,047 reported cases of acute schistosomiasis were analyzed, a reduction in prevalence of 97.7% between 2005 and 2012 was found. In contrast, imported cases of acute schistosomiasis increased between 2011 and 2012. These findings support the approach and effectiveness of the new integrated strategy in the reduction of schistosomiasis morbidity.
