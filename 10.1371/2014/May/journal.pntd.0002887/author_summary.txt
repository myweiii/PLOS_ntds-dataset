Human cysticercosis is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease causing severe health disorders such as epilepsy and even death. Cysticercosis is related to poverty, inadequate hygiene conditions and traditional pig farming. The present study describes the dynamic nature of human Taenia solium larval infections in an Ecuadorian endemic community. In this study we report for the first time incidence rate and cumulative incidence figures of human T. solium larval infections in Latin America. The simultaneous use of antibody and antigen serological detections allowed estimating both parasite exposure and infection rates, respectively. While about 13% of the inhabitants were exposed to T. solium eggs, less than 1% of the population became yearly infected with the parasite. This contrast between exposure and infection may be linked to an effective resistance to the parasite acquired through long-term exposure of the population and differs from the African situation, where much higher levels of infection have been observed. These estimates are of high importance to understand the epidemiology of T. solium in order to develop ad hoc cost-effective prevention and control programs. They are also essential to assess the burden of T. solium cysticercosis since longitudinal data are needed to make regional and global projections of morbidity and mortality related to cysticercosis.
