Chagas disease is a parasitic disease endemic to the Americas. Long term complications include severe cardiac involvement, which can lead to severe disability and death of affected individuals. Treatment options for Chagas disease are limited to 2 drugs (benznidazole and nifurtimox), but knowledge of the pharmacology of these drugs is lacking, particularly in childhood. To date, no pharmacokinetics data are available in children. We conducted the first population pharmacokinetic study of benznidazole in children. Interestingly, we found that elimination of the drug is significantly faster in children than in adults, leading to lower plasma concentrations. However, unlike adults, all children in the study responded well and had few adverse reactions to the drug. These findings suggest that adjustment of current adult doses may be beneficial.
