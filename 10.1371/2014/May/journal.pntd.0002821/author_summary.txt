Onchocerciasis has been known to be endemic in the northwestern coastal riverine jungle areas of the country since the early 1980's. A mass drug administration program with ivermectin was implemented in 1991, and in recent years has included consistent twice a year treatment. The impact of this program, and progress towards eliminating the transmission of Onchocerca volvulus from the endemic zone, was assessed by studying entomological parameters at sentinel sites in 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2008 using PCR detection of infective larvae in the vectors (Simulium exiguum and Simulium quadrivittatum); the survey of 2008 showed that all of the collection sites had reached a level consistent with the interruption of transmission. Serological assessment of children and adolescents in 2001â€“2008 also showed that transmission had been interrupted. These findings support the contention that the Ecuadorian Program has reached the post-treatment surveillance phase of the elimination program; mass drug administration of ivermectin was consequently stopped. The factors contributing to this successful achievement include ivermectin coverage of consistently around 85% or greater since 1998, careful consideration and control of possible expansions of the endemic area through migration, and the maintenance of a strong community health programme.
