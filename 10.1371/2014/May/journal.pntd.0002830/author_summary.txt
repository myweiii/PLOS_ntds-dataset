Human toxocariasis is a neglected parasitic infection occurring in Brazil and worldwide. The combination of the close proximity of canines and felines to humans, environmental contamination by infectious forms of the parasite and neglect by public health officials provides a favorable situation for the spread of this zoonosis, which primarily affects pediatric populations. An epidemiological study in an area of known parasitic soil contamination was conducted to evaluate the impact of this disease and the factors that influence its occurrence. A sample of 1- to 12-year-old children was obtained with random selection of schools, classrooms and schoolchildren. A questionnaire was used to collect socioeconomic and behavioral information, laboratory tests determined the presence of antibodies against Toxocara spp. parasites and a medical evaluation noted clinical features of the disease. The study found that antibodies is present in more than 15% of subjects and can be in as many as 30% depending on individual characteristics. The analysis also indicated that behaviors that increase soil ingestion, such as nail biting, eating dirt or poor personal hygiene, contribute to increased frequency of the disease and may be even more important than the socioeconomic status of individuals. These behaviors therefore represent real and simple targets for the control of this neglected tropical disease.
