Chagas disease remains a significant public health issue in Latin America. Caused by the single-celled parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the main route of infection is via contact with contaminated faeces from blood-sucking triatomine bugs, but following successful insecticide spraying campaigns, congenital, food-borne, and transfusion/transplantation routes of infection have become more relevant. In the absence of successful chemotherapy, T. cruzi usually persists in the body for life, and in symptomatic cases may lead to death or debilitation by heart failure and/or gastrointestinal megasyndromes. As a species, T. cruzi displays great genetic diversity, and is subdivided into lineages called TcI - TcVI. Associating T. cruzi lineage with clinical symptoms is a key goal of Chagas disease research. Direct isolation and typing of T. cruzi from chronically infected patients is hampered by the sequestration of the parasite in host tissues. Identifying lineage-specific antibodies in serum provides an alternative approach to determining an individual's history of infection. Here, we performed lineage-specific serology using samples from a range of South American countries. We show that lineage-specific seropositivity is associated with geographical distributions and clinical outcome. These findings have wide implications for further diagnostics development and improved understanding of the epidemiology of Chagas disease.
