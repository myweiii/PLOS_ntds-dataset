Mycobacterium ulcerans is a slow growing pathogen, which is prevalent in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. M. ulcerans possesses unique signaling pathways with only 13 STPK containing genes. This is strikingly different from its closest homolog Mycobacterium marinum and surprisingly closer to the human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. PknQ, MupFHA and MupDivIVA are regulatory proteins encoded by the virulence determining plasmid pMUM001 of M. ulcerans. In addition to characterizing the STPK, we focused on deciphering the basis of interaction between the three partner proteins leading to the identification of critical residues. Present study describes the newly identified phosphoserine-based interactions, which is unique amongst the FHA-domain containing proteins. We confirmed our results using structural analysis via specific mutants and their interaction profiles. Importantly, these data highlight the significance of FHA domains and their role in understanding cellular signaling. This work will encourage further studies to elucidate role of M. ulcerans signaling systems. It will also raise questions like how less studied tropical bacterial pathogens acquire eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr protein kinase and exhibit unusual mechanisms to interact with its partner domains.
