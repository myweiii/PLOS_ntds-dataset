Viral hemorrhagic fever is a syndrome often associated with high fatality and risk of secondary transmission. In 2008, an outbreak of a novel hemorrhagic fever virus called Lujo occurred in Johannesburg, South Africa, with secondary transmission from the index patient to four healthcare workers. Four of the five patients died. Lujo belongs to the arenavirus family and is only the second pathogenic arenavirus, after Lassa virus, to be recognized in Africa and the first in over 40 years. Because most viral hemorrhagic fevers occur in remote, resource-poor settings, few in-depth controlled studies of their clinical manifestations, transmission dynamics, pathogenesis, or response to treatment options are possible. We describe the clinical features of the five cases in this outbreak and summarize the clinical management, as well as providing additional epidemiologic detail. Lujo virus causes a clinical syndrome remarkably similar to Lassa fever. The treatment options used in these five cases are discussed as well as the recommended precautions to prevent secondary transmission.
