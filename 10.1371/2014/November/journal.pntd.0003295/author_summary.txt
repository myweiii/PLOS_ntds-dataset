Yellow fever virus causes âˆ¼200,000 infections and 30,000 deaths annually in Africa and South America. Although this is an important human pathogen, the basis of yellow fever disease severity remains poorly understood. Rhesus macaques are susceptible to yellow fever and develop similar symptoms as severe as those observed in humans. In this study, we characterized disease progression in this model and observed a profound loss of lymphocytes that preceded the appearance of serum markers of virus-induced liver pathology. This change might provide an early indicator of fatal yellow fever. In addition, we also identified significant changes in gene expression in white blood cells that occur before any measurable disease symptoms and these genetic signatures may provide future targets for antiviral therapeutics and better diagnostics.
