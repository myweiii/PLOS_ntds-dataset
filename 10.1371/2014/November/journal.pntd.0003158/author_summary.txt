Dengue disease is a tropical and subtropical mosquito-borne viral illness, and is a major public health concern in all endemic countries. Our aim was to determine the impact of dengue disease on the Mexican population over time, and to identify future research priorities and challenges of the surveillance system. To do this, we conducted a systematic literature review to describe the knowledge and gaps in the epidemiology of dengue disease. We used well-defined methods to search and identify relevant epidemiologic research conducted in Mexico between 2000 and 2011. This long-term review highlights an increase in the incidence of dengue diseaseâ€”as well as in the number of severe cases and deaths in Mexico. Gaps in epidemiological knowledge regarding local serotype distribution, genotype evolution, age-stratified incidence and prevalence, hospitalization rates, underreporting rates as well as primary and secondary infections of dengue provide several avenues for future research. Improved epidemiological data from enhanced surveillance strategies (such as incorporating sentinel sites, more private health units, and information technologies) are required to enable evaluation of disease prevention and management interventions.
