Dengue disease is a tropical and subtropical mosquito-borne viral illness and is a major health concern in the Philippines. To determine the dengue disease burden in the Philippines and identify gaps and future research needs, we conducted a literature analysis and review to describe the epidemiology of dengue disease. We used well-defined methods to search and identify relevant research conducted between 2000 and 2011. This long-term review highlights an increase in the reported incidence of dengue disease in the Philippines. The rising incidence of dengue disease may be related to a growing population, increasing urbanization, improvements in surveillance, and the limited success of vector control measures. Gaps in the epidemiological information available in the Philippines during the period 2000â€“2011 include comprehensive national and regional data that describe the proportion of severe dengue disease, including hospitalizations and mortality, and incidence data per 100,000 population. More comprehensive data are also needed for age, serotype, and seroprevalence on both national and regional levels. The data presented enable the observation of epidemiological characteristics, both within and across years. Such assessments are essential at national and regional levels to improve both preparedness and response activities relating to dengue disease outbreaks.
