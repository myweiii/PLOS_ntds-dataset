IL-10 has multiple cellular functions, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the serum levels of IL-10 are significantly increased in DENV-infected patients with severe disorders. However, the molecular mechanism underlying DENV-induced IL-10 production is still unresolved. In this study, we demonstrate a molecular mechanism for DENV-induced IL-10 production, which may be exacerbated by ADE through Fcγ receptor-mediated extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, leading to IL-10/SOCS3-mediated advantages for viral replication. With or without Fcγ receptor- or CLEC5A-mediated DENV infection, a common Syk/PKA-regulated PI3K/PKB activation results in a decrease in GSK-3β activity followed by an increase in CREB-mediated IL-10 expression not only in THP-1 monocytic cells but also in human monocytes. Taken together, we demonstrate a potential regulation and a pathological role for ADE-induced IL-10 overproduction during DENV replication. Therefore, inhibiting immunosuppression by targeting the IL-10 pathways identified in this study may help to prevent the progression of severe dengue diseases.
