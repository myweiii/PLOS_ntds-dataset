Praziquantel is the drug used worldwide to treat intestinal and urinary schistosomiasis, diseases caused by the infection with different species of the parasitic worm Schistosoma. Summarizing findings of different studies is important in order to characterize how the parasite responds to treatment and to what extent humans can tolerate the medication. We found over 270 clinical trials on praziquantel, and, although less than one-third could be included in this analysis, the total number of subjects enrolled nears 20,000. This large number of subjects allows deriving general conclusions even though the methodologies used to conduct these studies (how the infection is diagnosed, how treatment effects are assessed) were not always uniform. These analyses confirm that the WHO-recommended praziquantel treatment (single dose of 40 mg/kg) works well on all species and at all ages, although in a proportion of study locations the levels of efficacy may be lower than expected.
