Dengue disease is a mosquito-borne viral illness and is a major health concern in the Americas. We conducted a literature analysis and review to describe the epidemiology of dengue in the French Territories of the Americas (FTA), comprising French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy, to determine the impact of dengue on the population and to identify research priorities. We used well-defined methods to search for and identify relevant research conducted between 2000 and 2012. We identified an increase in the frequency, magnitude and severity of dengue epidemics across all the territories, an increase in the co-circulation of serotypes and the evolution to a hyperendemic state. Countries sharing geographical and environmental characteristics (e.g., Martinique and Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin) also shared characteristics in dengue epidemiology and its evolution, including timing of epidemics and circulating serotypes. Gaps in epidemiological knowledge provide several avenues for research, such as dengue virus genotype distribution, seroprevalence and age distribution of dengue cases. Epidemiological and virological surveillance of dengue in the FTA is evolving, and improved knowledge of the disease in these territories will improve anticipation of epidemics and aid implementation of control measures.
