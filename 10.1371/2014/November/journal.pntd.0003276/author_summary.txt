Filarial parasites and soil-transmitted nematodes (STNs) are Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) that affect millions of people in the developing world. There is an urgent need for novel drugs and improved use of existing drugs, because of concerns about the development of resistance. The mode of action of one of these drugs, diethylcarbamazine, remains unclear, despite the fact that it has been used for a long time for treatment and prevention of filariae and STNs. The resistance-busting anthelmintic emodepside also has effects against filariae and STNs, with a mode of action that involves activation of nematode SLO-1 K+ channels. The effects of both diethylcarbamazine and emodepside may be increased by inflammatory mediators, which suggests that the effects of diethylcarbamazine and emodepside will be additive. We used our Ascaris suum preparation to test the activation of SLO-1 K+ channels by diethylcarbamazine and its potentiating effect on emodepside. Our results suggest potential for diethylcarbamazine and emodepside in combination therapy for parasitic nematodes.
