Immunoprotection to paracoccidiodomycosis, a systemic mycosis endemic in Latin America, is mediated by T cell immunity whereas immunosuppression characterizes the severe forms of the disease. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme mainly induced by IFN-Î³, catabolizes tryptophan along the kynurenines pathway. Tryptophan deficiency has been associated with reduced pathogen growth, while elevated levels of kynurenines with suppressed immune responses. In this study, the role of IDO in pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis was investigated using resistant and susceptible mice. In both mouse strains, IDO blockade by 1-methyl tryptophan resulted in inefficient fungal clearance accompanied by enhanced T cell immunity. Despite these equivalent biological effects, only in susceptible mice IDO inhibition caused progressive fungal growth and tissue pathology resulting in increased mortality. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that IDO exert a yet unexplored immunoregulatory role in pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis that can be particularly important in the severe cases of the disease.
