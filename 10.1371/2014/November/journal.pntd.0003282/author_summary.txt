To examine the participation of MMP-9 in the pathogenesis of L. braziliensis infection, we realized a cross-sectional study with CL patients in an early phase of the disease or with a classical ulcer, and healthy controls. We evaluated the frequency of MMP-9 in monocyte subsets and its mechanism of production. Our results showed that monocytes were the major cells producing MMP-9. The MMP-9 production by CL patients was presented in higher levels when compared with healthy subjects and early cutaneous leishmaniasis (ECL) patients, and the levels of MMP-9 inhibitor, TIMP-1, were lower in CL patients when compared to healthy subjects. The production of MMP-9 was enhanced by TNF, a cytokine associated with tissue damage in CL patients. Thus, therapeutic modulation of MMP-9 may be a useful approach for improving disease outcome in L. braziliensis patients.
