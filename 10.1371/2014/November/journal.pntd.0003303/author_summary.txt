Disabilities among Buruli ulcer patients remain a problem. Previous studies revealed contractures, deformities and functional limitations in daily life after treatment. According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, disabilities occur not only at the physical and activity level but at the participation level (participation restrictions) as well. The latter are the social consequences of the disease such as problems in relationships, going to festivals and visiting public places. This study focused on participation restrictions by using the Participation Scale among former Buruli ulcer patients and healthy persons residing in two areas endemic for Buruli ulcer in Ghana and Benin. This study showed that almost half of the former Buruli ulcer patients encountered problems in social life, especially related to employment. In addition, the results suggest that being female, perceived stigma, functional limitations and a larger lesion (category II) predict participation restrictions. These findings indicate that rehabilitation programs should not only focus on physical disabilities but also on participation after completion of medical treatment.
