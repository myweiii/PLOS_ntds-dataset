Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most common cause of cardiomyopathy in Latin America. After the acute phase myocarditis, the disease becomes asymptomatic, and many years later some patients may develop Chagas cardiomyopathy. Treatment is available, but causes side effects. Thus, new drugs are needed, but there are no good tools to assess treatment efficacy. We performed the first global metabolomics analysis in heart tissue and plasma from mice infected with T. cruzi along the infection. We have identified more than 200 biochemicals (around 2/3 of total) that significantly differed in heart and 100 (around 1/3) in plasma. Some of those show extremely marked and highly significant differences. More importantly, our results unravel many new aspects of metabolic alterations that can be useful for: a) better understanding the pathogenesis of this disease; b) provide new clinic-pathological data of T. cruzi infection that can be potentially used for a better clinical management of Chagasic patients; c) define several metabolites as potential biomarkers of this disease. Thus, our study identifies common biomarkers of cardiomyopathy but more importantly specific candidate biomarkers of acute Chagas Disease Cardiomyopathy, not observed in a clinically similar disease Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomiopathy. Allantoin, kynurenine and p-cresol sulfate, that can be easily detected in serum, are highly promising candidates. In summary, we think our results would help to better understand the pathogenesis and management of the disease and offer new candidate biomarkers for monitoring the severity of the disease and treatment efficacy.
