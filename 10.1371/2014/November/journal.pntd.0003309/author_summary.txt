Visceral leishmaniasis is a dangerous and important, but neglected, tropical disease that affects millions of people, mainly in underdeveloped and developing countries. Presently, there are no vaccines against Leishmaniasis, and the few drugs with which the disease is treated have low efficacy and high side effects. The pathogenic agent of this disease in the New World is Leishmania infantum chagasi. In this work, we studied a protein from this parasite named ENTPDase-2. We expressed it in a bacterial system, purified it and characterized it as a genuine nucleotidase of the ENTPDase family. This protein seems to be localized at the surface of the parasite and in other intracellular locations. ENTPDase seems to facilitate in vitro infection because its blockade leads to lower levels of infection of macrophages. In addition, the protein is found in naturally infected dogs. A previous study demonstrated that ENTPDase-2 from L. infantum chagasi is a good antigen for immunodiagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis. We have now studied this protein in greater depth and suggest that it may be a good target for drug development.
