One of the major challenges of schistosomiasis control is that disease prevalence reverts to baseline levels after mass drug administration due to high rate of reinfection. Host factors play a major role in determining resistance or susceptibility to reinfection with schistosomiasis and other diseases. We systematically searched and analyzed studies that identified potential host determinants of reinfection with schistosomes. Among demographic variables, age but not gender was strongly associated with reinfection with schistosomes. Pretreatment infection intensity was also identified as a major determinant of reinfection. Positive association with IgG4 levels and negative association with IgE levels reconfirmed the notion that IgE/IgG4 balance is the major factor controlling protective immunity against schistosomiasis. Other factors were reported by few studies to allow correct inferences. These results contribute to our understanding of host-parasite relationship as it affects reinfection, and will be useful for planning and targeting the limited resources for intervention on high-risk groups.
