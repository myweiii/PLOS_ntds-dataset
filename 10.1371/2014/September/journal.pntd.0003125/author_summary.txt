Taenia solium is a zoonotic parasite which infects humans and pigs resulting in the cysticercosis/taeniasis duo of neglected tropical diseases. It is commonly known as the pork tapeworm. Infection of the human brain with this parasite causes up to a third of epilepsy in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Infection of pigs is a food-safety issue, as consumption of contaminated pork results in intestinal tapeworm infection in humans who may then transmit the parasite to others. Pig infection also results in economic harm to small landowners who cannot sell the contaminated pork. Despite increasing worldwide attention to these diseases, sustainable and effective control strategies have been elusive. One possible approach is to direct limited screening and treatment resources to specific subpopulations which have the highest risk of infection. In this study we found that screening for intestinal tapeworms among people who live nearby a heavily-infected pig reduced transmission of the parasite in the overall community by 40% over one year. This practical strategy could be implemented as a potentially sustainable community-based intervention in the poor rural regions of world where the disease is endemic.
