Parasitic worms, called helminths, infect one-third of the world population. Despite exposure to their host's immune system many helminths establish chronic infections and survive several years within their host. They avoid elimination by dampening the immune response of their hosts. This immune suppression also affects immune responses to third-party antigens such as vaccines. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that helminth-infected humans display impaired responses to vaccination. Thus, anthelminthic treatment before vaccination is discussed. Here, we use helminth-infected mice to analyse kinetics and mechanism of helminth-induced interference with vaccination efficacy more precisely. We show that chronic helminth infection completely suppressed antibody responses to a model vaccine. Thereby helminths suppressed the antibody-producing B cells indirectly via suppression of accessory T helper cells. The suppression was more pronounced at later time points of infection and still observed in mice that had terminated the helminth infection for more than 16 weeks. In summary, our results suggest that vaccination may not only fail in helminth-infected individuals, but also in individuals with a history of previous helminth infections. Thus, our report highlights the importance to develop vaccination strategies that are functional despite concurrent helminth infection rather than deworming humans before vaccination.
