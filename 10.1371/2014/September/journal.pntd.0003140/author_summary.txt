Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is characterized by clinical manifestations of limb swelling, lymphedema, and elephantiasis. LF is the world's second-leading cause of disability, with up to 15 million people with limb lymphedema or elephantiasis. The Global Programme to Eliminate LF aims to eliminate the disease through two pillars: (1) interruption of transmission and (2) treatment of clinical disease among those already affected. The Church's Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA), an Indian NGO, began a lymphedema management program in Khurda District, Odisha State, India in 2007. We evaluated the impact of the program on two clinical LF outcomes: acute episodes of adenolymphangitis (ADLA) and chronic lymphedema progression. The monthly rate of ADLA episodes decreased significantly after enrollment for two years in the program. Additionally, program compliance was found to be associated with ADLA rate among some clinically distinct groups. Compliance to soap was associated with a decreased rate of ADLA episodes among those without inter-digital entry lesions. The percentage of patients who progressed to more severe lymphedema decreased significantly over time, while those whose lymphedema regressed increased significantly. These results indicate that a community-based lymphedema management program is beneficial for lymphedema patients for both ADLA episodes and lymphedema. It is one of the first studies to demonstrate an association between program compliance and ADLA episodes.
