Neglected diseases lead to illness, long-term disability and affect economic development in poor populations. There is evidence that clinical research on neglected diseases has increased starting from the second half of the '90s. This paper aims at updating this evidence to 2012 and at integrating available data (groups of target of the clinical projects, phase in the clinical development process, sponsors) with other data that have not been investigated or published so far (recruitment status of patients, and trials location of the trials coordinator). Our study has confirmed previous findings on the important investment in NDs, highlighting, thanks to a disease-specific approach, a particular focus on diseases with a higher diffusion risk, but not necessarily the higher prevalence and the most unmet need. In most studies, patients' recruitment has been completed, and many trials are also in the very terminal phases: this means a high probability that new treatments will be available in the next years. In addition, trial coordinator centres are increasingly located in low income countries; as a consequence, the investment in clinical research has become an opportunity to further enhance clinical and organisational expertise in these countries.
