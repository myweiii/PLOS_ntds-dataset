Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infection can cause severe neurological disease in man. More JE cases are seen in northwestern districts in Bangladesh. Pigs are the most common amplifying host of the virus and can act as a potential environmental source. We conducted a comprehensive census of pigs in three JE endemic districts and tested a sample of them for evidence of previous JEV infection. We built a compartmental model to describe JEV transmission dynamics in this region and to estimate the potential impact of pig vaccination. We identified 11,364 pigs in our study area, mostly raised in backyards. About 30% of the pigs had evidence of previous JE virus infection. Our model suggests that vaccinating 50% of pigs each year resulted in an estimated 82% reduction in annual incidence in pigs. Pigs in northwestern Bangladesh may play a significant role in JE virus transmission. JE incidence may be substantially reduced through reasonable pig vaccination coverage.
