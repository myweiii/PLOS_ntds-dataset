Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread parasite of animals that is easily transmitted to humans. Previous studies have shown that human infections in jungle areas of French Guiana are often quite severe, unlike most human infections that are characterized by mild symptoms in healthy adults. Here we characterized the genetic makeup of strains from French Guiana and confirm that while genetically homogeneous strains exist in anthropized environments, highly divergent and pathogenic isolates are found in jungle environments. The geographic separation of strain types is also mirrored in conserved genomic regions, including a monomorphic version of chromosome 1a (Chr1A), which has previously been associated with the spread of different lineages around the world. Strains harboring the monomorphic Chr1a showed greater potential for transmission in domestic cats, which may contribute to their prevalence in anthropized environments. Our findings also revealed large differences in acute virulence of French Guiana isolates in the laboratory mouse, and these differ from known genetic mechanisms that have been defined previously. Hence, the ability of some strain types to expand in the environment as a consequence of enhanced transmission may also lead to the spread of virulence determinants.
