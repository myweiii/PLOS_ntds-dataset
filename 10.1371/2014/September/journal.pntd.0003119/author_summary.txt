Diarrhea in cholera results from stimulation of cAMP-mediated intestinal Cl− secretion by cholera toxin (CT). This study demonstrates that diclofenac, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), inhibited cAMP-activated Cl− secretion in human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells by inhibiting both apical Cl− channels (i.e. CFTR) and cAMP-activated basolateral K+ channels (i.e. KCNQ1/KCNE3). The mechanism by which CFTR was inhibited did not involve changes in intracellular cAMP levels and activation of negative regulators of CFTR activity including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein phosphatase. In addition, diclofenac suppressed two other types of apical Cl− channels, namely, Ca2+-activated Cl− channels and inwardly rectifying Cl− channels, and Ca2+-activated basolateral K+ channels (i.e. KCa3.1) without affecting Na+-K+ ATPase and Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporter activities. Of particular importance, diclofenac at 30 mg/kg, which is the human equivalent dose for treatment of pain and inflammation (∼2 mg/kg in human), exhibited anti-secretory efficacy in mouse closed-loop models of cholera induced by either CT or V. cholerae. This study provides a rational basis for further development of diclofenac and related compounds as anti-diarrheal therapy for cholera and other types of diarrheas resulting from Cl− transport-driven intestinal fluid secretion.
