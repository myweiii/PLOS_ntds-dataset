Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector-borne parasitic disease transmitted to humans by sandflies and characterized by local ulcerative skin lesions. The disease is linked to poverty in the Middle-East, North and East Africa, South-Central Asia and South America, with 0.7 to 1.2 million new annual cases estimated. In most endemic regions CL treatment relies on injections with pentavalent antimonials, old generation drugs with considerable side effects and long treatment regimens. CL is therefore a highly undertreated disease in need of easy-to-administer, orally bioavailable and well-tolerated agents with broad clinical activity. To date, the only oral drug with acceptable efficacy against leishmaniasis is miltefosine, an alkylphosphocholine with a narrow therapeutic window that limits its use. Given the existing clinical need for CL, we tested the efficacy of oleylphosphocholine (OlPC) in a validated mouse model of Old World (Leishmania major) CL. OlPC is a new orally bioavailable drug of the same family as miltefosine with potent and broad leishmanicidal activity. In direct comparison with miltefosine, our results indicate that OlPC induces higher parasite clearance and lesion healing with measurable improved tolerance. These promising observations warrant further research on OlPC as a new drug to improve clinical management of CL.
