Buruli ulcer (BU) remains a mysterious disease without efficient prevention since the mode of transmission of its agent, Mycobacterium ulcerans, is still unknown. The disease is highly localised within countries and even at the village scale within endemic regions, but environmental factors explaining this focal distribution have not been described yet. In this article, we rely on a large series of cases originating from Akonolinga region, Centre region, Cameroon, and recorded at the BU treatment center of the hospital of Akonolinga. The series of 787 patients over 10 years allows us to describe the distribution of BU incidence in the region and its changes over time and space. We identify the Nyong River as a major risk factor, and identify environmental factors along the river that further increase the risk of BU, such as the high proportion of swamps, the degradation of forests and cultivation of lands by human populations. These results will help to locate where the transmission is most likely to happen, and provide useful elements for targeting case search, prevention actions and future research on M. ulcerans transmission.
