New evidence has shown that the pathogenic mechanism of disease-associated HTLV-1 infection is an impairment of the immunity. More recently, it has been demonstrated that IL28B polymorphisms are more likely to occur among HTLV-1 infected subjects and are associated with higher proviral loads in HTLV-1 carriers. Based on anti-HCV properties exhibited by IL28B, we examined the possibility of an association between IL28B polymorphisms (rs8099917 and rs12979860 SNPs) and HAM/TSP occurrence in a large cohort of HTLV-1-infected subjects in Sao Paulo city, Brazil. This study included 229 HTLV-1-infected subjects classified according to their neurological status in two groups (asymptomatic vs HAM/TSP cases), and observed that persons with SNP rs8099917 genotype GG and rs12979860 genotype CT may present a distinct immune response against HTLV-1 infection. Thus, it seems reasonable to suggest that a search for IL28B polymorphisms should be performed for all HTLV-1-infected subjects in order to monitor their risk for HAM/TSP development.
