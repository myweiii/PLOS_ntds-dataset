The area of Walikale, in the eastern province of North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo has been experiencing ongoing conflict, violence and population displacement in recent years. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been working in this part of DRC since July 2012 and decided to document the impact of the conflict on the population by estimating the number of deaths that had occurred in this community between July 2012 and April 2013. Thirty-one villages (with 21 households each) were randomly selected; households were asked to report on the number of deaths, cases of disease, access to health care and ownership of items such as bednets and jerry cans. The overall mortality rate during the period was 1.4 deaths/10,000 person per day, which exceeded the emergency thresholds of 1/10,000 per day. In children under five years this was 1.9/10,000/day; close to the emergency thresholds of 2/10,000/day for this age group. Malaria and diarrhea were commonly reported causes of death and disease. Access to health care was limited due to financial constraints and ownership of bednets and jerrycans very low. The impact of the conflict in the health status of people in this part of DRC therefore appeared to be quite dramatic.
