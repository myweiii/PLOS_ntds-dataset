The parasitic diseases malaria and schistosomiasis are tremendous public health burdens, each affecting over 200 million people worldwide with substantial geographic overlap in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding how schistosomiasis influences the human immune response to Plasmodium, the agent of malaria, can be important for developing effective malaria vaccines. Past studies have tried to determine if infection with Schistosoma haematobium, which causes urinary schistosomiasis, affects the number of febrile attacks from malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in communities where the diseases overlap, but the findings have been inconsistent. Here, we examined 616 healthy people from a village in Mali for symptomless infections with S. haematobium and treated those with infections. We then followed them over a single malaria-transmission season of 7 months during which we diagnosed and treated all febrile malaria attacks. After the season, we examined archived blood collected at enrollment to look for occult P. falciparum infection. The study revealed that people who were infected with both parasites at the beginning of the season were better protected from the malaria attacks than those who were uninfected or infected with either parasite alone. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the biological basis for this phenomenon.
