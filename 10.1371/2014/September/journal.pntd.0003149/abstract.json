    "Background": "Although immunopathology dictates clinical outcome in leprosy, the dynamics of early and chronic infection are poorly defined. In the tuberculoid region of the spectrum, Mycobacterium leprae growth is restricted yet a severe granulomatous lesion can occur. The evolution and maintenance of chronic inflammatory processes like those observed in the leprosy granuloma involve an ongoing network of communications via cytokines. IL-10 has immunosuppressive properties and IL-10 genetic variants have been associated with leprosy development and reactions.",
    "Methodology/Principal Findings": "The role of IL-10 in resistance and inflammation in leprosy was investigated using Mycobacterium leprae infection of mice deficient in IL-10 (IL-10\u2212/\u2212), as well as mice deficient in both inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2\u2212/\u2212) and IL-10 (10NOS2\u2212/\u2212). Although a lack of IL-10 did not affect M. leprae multiplication in the footpads (FP), inflammation increased from C57Bl/6 (B6)<IL-10\u2212/\u2212<NOS2\u2212/\u2212<10NOS2\u2212/\u2212. While IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited modest FP induration compared to B6, NOS2\u2212/\u2212 and 10NOS2\u2212/\u2212 mice developed markedly enlarged FP marking distinct phases: early (1 month), peak (3\u20134 months), and chronic (8 months). IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+CD44+ cells responding to M. leprae cell wall, membrane, and cytosol antigens and ML2028 (Ag85B) were significantly increased in the evolved granuloma in NOS2\u2212/\u2212 FP compared to B6 and IL-10\u2212/\u2212 during early and peak phases. In 10NOS2\u2212/\u2212 FP, CD4+CD44+ and especially CD8+CD44+ responses were augmented even further to these antigens as well as to ML0380 (GroES), ML2038 (bacterioferritin), and ML1877 (EF-Tu). Moreover, fragmented nerves containing CD4+ cells were present in 10NOS2\u2212/\u2212 FP.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The 10NOS2\u2212/\u2212 strain offers insight on the regulation of granuloma formation and maintenance by immune modulators in the resistant forms of leprosy and presents a new model for investigating the pathogenesis of neurological involvement."
