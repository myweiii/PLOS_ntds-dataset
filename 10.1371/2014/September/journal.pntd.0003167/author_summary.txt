The mosquito, Aedes aegypti, was historically very important as the major vector of yellow fever, whereas today it is most notorious for being the major transmitter of dengue fever. In the 1940s and 50s, the Pan-American Health Organization organized a campaign to eradicate Ae. aegypti from the New World. They were partly successful, with Brazil being the largest country to be declared free of Ae. aegypti. Within ten years of relaxation of control efforts, Ae. aegypti reappeared in Brazil and today is the vector of the most intense dengue epidemics in the New World. Here, we present population genetic data that are most consistent with the species having truly been eradicated from Brazil rather than simply pushed into small refugia as a consequence of the eradication campaign. The re-infestation most likely resulted from two sources: 1) from northern S. American countries like Venezuela into northwest Brazil and 2) from the Caribbean into the southeast of the country.
