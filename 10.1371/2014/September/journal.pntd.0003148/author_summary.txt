Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU) is an environmental pathogen known to reside in aquatic habitat. However, the reservoir and modes of transmission to humans still remain unknown. M. ulcerans can probably not live freely due to its natural fragility and inability to withstand exposure to direct sunlight. This study investigated the hypothesis that free-living amoebae (FLA) can serve as a reservoir of M. ulcerans by testing for its presence in amoebae isolated from water bodies in BU endemic and non-endemic communities and whether the pathogen can remain viable when experimentally infected in amoebae in the laboratory. We detected only one (IS2404) of the three (IS2606 and KRB) targets for the presence of M. ulcerans in amoebae cultures and found no correlation between its presence in the environment and BU notification rate. M. ulcerans remained viable at low levels in amoebae for 28 days in vitro. We therefore conclude that FLA may host M. ulcerans at low levels in the environment without being directly involved in the transmission to humans.
