Sporothrix brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus that is responsible for an ongoing epidemic of cat-transmitted sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. More than 4,100 human cases have been diagnosed in only one health institution since 1998. Most patients are children or housewives with frequent contact with domestic and/or stray cats. The patients usually live under poverty conditions in suburban regions of the metropolitan area with poor access to health care and unsanitary living conditions. For instance, most patients report that they need to have cats in their houses as a control against invasion by rodents. It is important to study the clinical aspects of S. brasiliensis infection in order to improve patient management, including optimizing therapeutic and prophylactic approaches. We have found that S. brasiliensis is responsible for some unusual clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis, such as disseminated infection in immunocompetent patients and hypersensitivity reactions. Also, treatment with itraconazole appears to be extremely effective in most cases of infection by S. brasiliensis. Our study will contribute for the management of the infection caused by S. brasiliensis, bringing benefits to the patients with sporotrichosis.
