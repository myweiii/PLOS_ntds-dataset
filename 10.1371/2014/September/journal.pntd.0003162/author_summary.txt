Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic infection that affects skin and subcutaneous tissue, caused by some fungi which have a brownish color due to the presence of melanin pigments. The most frequent lesions are of verrucous type. Here we describe the participation of regulatory T cells and cells with the Th17 pattern of cytokines. High levels of Th17 cells participate in chronic inflammatory conditions, once at least in part they could improve the immune response and act in concomitance to the Th1 and Th2 patterns. Our results indicate a predominance of the Th17 pattern over Treg cells in verrucous lesions. We speculate that the local immune imbalance in CBM lesions characterized by exacerbated Th17 response, probably by suppressing the Treg response, is not effective for total fungal elimination. Even after long-period treatments, most patients has no absolute cure and often there is recurrence of the lesions. We believe that our study could contribute to the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of CBM and in such a way, presents some aspects to new possible therapies.
