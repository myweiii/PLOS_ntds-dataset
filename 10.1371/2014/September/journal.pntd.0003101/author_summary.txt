The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) represents a threat to Europe. This is supported by its recent introduction and autochthonous transmission in Italy and France in 2007 and 2010 respectively. CHIKV causes an acute febrile illness and severe joint pains that may last for several months in some patients. In absence of a proven effective treatment, safe and effective vaccines represent the best way to control outbreaks of CHIKV. This study describes the development of a vaccine candidate based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA). MVA has been used to develop vaccines against several viruses and based on the safety and efficacy records of MVA vaccines, various candidate vaccines are currently in clinical trials. MVA expressing structural proteins of CHIKV were constructed and tested in AG129 mice for immunogenicity and protective ability. All animals that received MVA expressing E2 developed neutralizing antibodies and were protected against lethal challenge. Our study shows that recombinant MVA expressing the E2 protein of CHIKV represents a potential candidate vaccine for prevention of CHIKV infections in travellers or endemic areas.
