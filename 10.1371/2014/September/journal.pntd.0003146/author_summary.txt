HTLV-1/2 are retroviruses transmitted by blood products, sexual contact and from mother to child, mainly through breastfeeding. The infection has a characteristic geographical distribution with endemic areas often neighbouring very low prevalence areas. Infection is life long and although asymptomatic in most cases, it can cause severe and disabling diseases in children and adults. There is currently no cure, vaccine or effective treatment for HTLV-1/2 infections. Our research is the first to study the prevalence of HTLV-1/2 in pregnant women living in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, the second largest in Brazil. 1,204 pregnant women were tested upon hospital admission for delivery in two public hospitals in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Mesquita, between November, 2012 and April, 2013 and a significant prevalence of HTLV-1/2 was found (0.66%). The socio-epidemiological profile of carrier mothers was similar to the controls'. Epidemiological knowledge is fundamental for the elaboration of public health policies such as routine HTLV-1/2 screening in antenatal care, since counselling and preventive measures, mainly avoidance of breastfeeding, are the only strategies currently available to interrupt the chain of transmission and the future development of HTLV-1/2-related diseases.
