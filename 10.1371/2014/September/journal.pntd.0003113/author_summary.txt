Both lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis are treated with ivermectin-based mass drug administration (MDA) regimens in Africa. Where the infections are co-endemic, ivermectin treatments cannot be stopped until both infection transmission cycles are broken. This report follows a previous determination that the LF transmission cycle had been interrupted in five districts (LGAs in Nigeria) but evidence was needed on the status of the onchocerciasis transmission cycle prior to halting MDA. In this report we determined (based on WHO guidelines) that most likely the transmission of onchocerciasis has been interrupted in Plateau and Nasarawa States and we conclude that ivermectin MDA could be stopped.
