Leishmaniases are a group of diseases—each one individually called leishmaniasis—that are caused by the protozoan Leishmania. They affect millions of people and thousands of dogs in tropical and mediterranean countries. Macrophages are the main cellular hosts of Leishmania in the mammalian host, where it is an obligatorily intracellular parasite. In this work, it is shown that mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, when infected in vitro with Leishmania, release small (no larger than 300 nm) extracellular vesicles (EVs), in the same way as uninfected macrophages. The EVs from the infected macrophages, however, induce in other macrophages the production of some cell hormones, named cytokines, which are involved with protection of the macrophage against infection and with the development of a protective immune response against the parasite.
