We are deeply grateful to the vector control-surveillance agents of the municipalities of Russas and Jaguaruana. The Cear√° state Health Department provided logistic support during field surveys; we particularly thank Claudia M Bezerra. We also thank the neighbors of our study sites for their kindness and patience, and David A Miller for insightful comments on multiple detection-state models. Constructive criticism by three anonymous reviewers helped improve this report.
