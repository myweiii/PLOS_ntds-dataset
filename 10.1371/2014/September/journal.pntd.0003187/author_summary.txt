Vector-borne disease prevention often relies on health agents inspecting dwellings and eliminating the vector infestation foci they detect. The effectiveness of prevention programs thus depends on vector-detection performance. Unfortunately, detection failures can be common, particularly when infestation is rare and vector foci small. Although this can threaten vector control, the actual performance of vector searches has seldom been investigated in detail. Here, we assess Chagas disease vector detection by trained control-surveillance agents. We used models that explicitly account for detection errors to analyze triplicate vector detection/non-detection records from 414 man-made ‘ecotopes’ (houses, henhouses, woodpiles, etc.) in two rural localities. On average, a single round of vector searches correctly identified about 28% of the infested ecotopes; detection was more challenging in lightly-infested ecotopes and in some ecotope types, particularly houses and brick piles. After correcting detection errors, we estimated that ∼45% of the ecotopes were most likely infested, while observed rates were ∼11–19%; standard, single-round vector searches therefore missed many infestation foci. Our findings underscore the importance of taking detection failures into account when assessing infestation by disease vectors, and illustrate a straightforward approach to tackle the major but still underappreciated problem of imperfect vector detection.
