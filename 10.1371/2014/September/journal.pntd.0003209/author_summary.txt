Nigeria carries the highest burden of NTDs in sub-Saharan Africa. However, public awareness and participation in NTD control activities is uncertain. The aim of this study was to provide information on the public perception of NTDs control activities in the context of preventive chemotherapy and morbidity reduction. We surveyed participants attending a job fair in Abuja, Nigeria in 2013 to find out their knowledge of NTDs control activities. Our results show that except for onchocerciasis control activities, many of the NTDs control activities currently ongoing in the country with national and international support are unknown to the public. There is a need for more efforts in publicizing NTDs control activities in the context of community participation.
