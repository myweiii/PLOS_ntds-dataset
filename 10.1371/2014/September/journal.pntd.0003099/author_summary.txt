In spite of the successful drug therapy, leprosy is still affecting people worldwide. It is well known that host genetic background influences leprosy development and that genetic variants have been associated with the disease. Therefore we conducted a study to evaluate the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) polymorphisms in leprosy. We observed that a polymorphism in miR-146a is associated with the risk to develop leprosy in Brazilians. Based on the analysis of clinical specimens, we found that the genetic variant was correlated with elevated levels of miR-146a and it is also a negative regulator of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), an important inflammatory mediator in the leprosy context. These findings provide tenable evidences that miR-146a is important in the control of gene expression during M. leprae infection and also may contribute with leprosy development by controlling TNF levels.
