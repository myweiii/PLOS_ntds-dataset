During the recent resurgence of chikungunya, the scale of imported cases into previously unaffected countries has caused great concern due to the presence of a competent vector (Aedes albopictus) in many of these regions. This study describes a mathematical model for a chikungunya outbreak in the rural Cambodian village of Trapeang Roka, where a chikungunya epidemic was recorded and documented in March 2012. The outbreak data is unique, in that all infections were confirmed by laboratory analysis, enabling the identification of asymptomatic individuals, in addition to individuals who failed to report details of their infection. A stochastic model, partitioning the infectious population into three distinct classes, is implemented using Gillespie's algorithm. We show that the incorporation of both biologically-confirmed symptomatic cases undocumented by date of fever onset and asymptomatic cases yields a higher estimate of the reproduction number. Our results highlight how reproduction numbers could be underestimated by limiting analysis to the epidemic curve. Carefully documenting cases and performing laboratory testing in cluster regions, such as the village considered here, could provide a more comprehensive insight into the true infection dynamics.
