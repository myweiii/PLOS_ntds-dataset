Lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis are neglected tropical diseases caused by filarial nematodes. The limitations of existing drugs to treat these infections highlight the need for new drugs. In the present study, we investigated myristoylation, a lipid modification of a subset of proteins that promotes their binding to cell membranes for varied biological functions. The process is catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), an enzyme which has been validated as a drug target in protozoan parasites. We performed kinetic analyses on Caenorhabditis elegans and Brugia malayi NMTs. NMT inhibitors were active against B. malayi microfilariae and adult worms, and C. elegans in culture. RNA interference and gene deletion in C. elegans further demonstrated that NMT is essential for nematode viability. Our genetic and chemical studies indicate the importance of myristoylation in the synthesis of functional proteins in nematodes and have shown for the first time that NMT is required for viability in parasitic nematodes. These results suggest that targeting NMT could be a valid approach for the development of new therapies against nematode infection including filarial diseases.
