Onchocerciasis affects over 37 million people in poor communities. Infected individuals usually present a generalized form which is characterized by low inflammation, tightly-controlled immune responses and high parasite burden. In contrast, patients with chronic dermatitis (sowda) have reduced parasite loads and severe pathology. Current disease control is based on mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin (IVM) which mainly eliminates microfilariae (MF), the transmission life-stage. In hyperendemic areas, 95% of individuals are MF+, whereas in hypoendemic areas the rate is <30%. Recently, in areas that have been part of MDA programmes, individuals have been identified that present nodules but are amicrofilaridermic (a-MF). The following study therefore compared immunological profiles of a-MF and MF+ individuals and determined that only a handful of parameters significantly differed. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that immune responses were correlated to covariates MF, IVM or even the residing area (implying differing rounds of IVM MDA). For example, IL-5 responses were highly associated with MF whereas IL-17 responses were related to the region. The data imply that this “man-made” group has a distinct immune profile but also suggests that immune responses are affected by the amount of IVM intake on both the individual and community level (region).
