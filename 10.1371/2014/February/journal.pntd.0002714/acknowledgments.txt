We also wish to thank Patrick Mubiana, Nina Moonga, Mable Mwale-Mutengo (Ministry of Health, Lusaka), Douglas Banda (School of Veterinary Medicine, Lusaka), Benson Mandanda (School of Medicine, University of Zambia, Lusaka) and Sandy Sianongo (University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka) for their tremendous dedication to the field work throughout the country, and we recognize the contributions made in the early years by Getrude Chanda (Mpongwe District Health Management Team), Sister Nelly (St. Theresa Mission Hospital), Andiseni Zulu (Choma DHMT), Samuel Sichamba (Mbala DHMT) and the late Martin Lupunga (Luangwa DHMT). The support of the then Director-General of Central Board of Health, Dr. Ben Chirwa, is also greatly valued. The authors also wish to acknowledge the support of the former Director of Public Health in the Ministry of Health, Dr. Victor Mukonka. The field surveys would not have been accomplished without important expert advice from WHO-Afro, WHO-Lusaka (through the country representative, Dr. Olusegun Badaniyi), Ministry of Health in Zambia and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK.
