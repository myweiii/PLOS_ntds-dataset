Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating mosquito borne parasitic infection which worldwide affects more than 120 million people. It is also widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa. A World Health Organization coordinated Global Programme to Eliminate LF has targeted LF for elimination as a public health problem by the year 2020, with annual mass drug administration (MDA) being the primary measure for this endeavor. An important first step before initiating MDA is the geographical mapping of infection in order to delimit the target areas. Past case reports have indicated that LF occurs in Zambia, but knowledge on its distribution and prevalence has been limited. Here we report on a country-wide survey carried out to map the geographical distribution and prevalence pattern across Zambia by screening adult volunteers for specific circulating filarial antigens (CFA). The CFA prevalences observed at the numerous survey sites are presented and mapped to give an indication of LF distribution in the country. The observed geographical variation is furthermore examined using a species distribution modeling approach to explore environmental requirements for LF presence, and to predict potential suitable habitats over unsurveyed areas. The findings provide a firm background for planning and start-up of LF control in Zambia.
