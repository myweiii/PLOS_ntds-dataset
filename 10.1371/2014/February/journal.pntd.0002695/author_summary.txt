Molecular epidemiology of infectious diseases, which uses pathogen genetics to determine risk factors in the human population, is commonly employed to assist in outbreak investigation. While definitive genetic markers and techniques have been developed for several other bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens, the scientific community has yet to agree on an international standard for inter- and intra-species differentiation of Leishmania, the parasite that causes the disease leishmaniasis. As leishmaniasis represents one of the highest disease burdens among the neglected tropical diseases, development of molecular techniques, which allow for inter-laboratory comparability through international sequence databases, is imperative for moving forward with disease control. Based on the current standard technique employed for bacteria, the authors propose a panel of six genetic markers for multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) for intraspecific differentiation of Leishmania braziliensis, the most widely distributed of the Leishmania species in Brazil. Using strains from a recent outbreak in the sub-tropical non-endemic southern Brazil in comparison with strains from eleven other Brazilian states, the authors provide a practical example of how this technique can be applied in a real world outbreak situation.
