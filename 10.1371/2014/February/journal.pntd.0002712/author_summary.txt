Dengue infection is getting more common in recent years, affecting all age groups. Currently, there is no specific treatment for dengue. Close clinical monitoring and careful fluid therapy is the only way of management for those with severe dengue disease, i.e., dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). It is crucial to know among patients with dengue, who will potentially progress to DHF/DSS in the most reliable, economical and fastest way, so as to prioritise limited resources. We investigated the presence of protein in urine as an indicator of progression to DHF/DSS. Adult patients with dengue were enrolled to our clinic. Clinical data, blood and urine were collected. We found that patients who were going to develop DHF/DSS had increased protein one day prior to developing to DHF/DSS. DHF/DSS cases had higher protein levels in urine compared to patients with just dengue fever. Laboratory-based urine protein data, when used together with other readily available blood tests, helped to detect 92% of DHF cases correctly. Currently available clinic-based urine protein test strip was not useful in predicting severe disease. Future studies may improve the ability of the clinic-based tests, thus reducing the reliance on laboratory testing.
