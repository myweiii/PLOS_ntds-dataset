T. cruzi is a protozoan pathogen responsible for Chagas disease. Current therapies rely only on a very small number of drugs, most of which are inadequate because of their severe host toxicity or because of their susceptibility to drug-resistance mechanisms. To determine efficient therapeutic alternatives, the identification of new biotargets and detailed knowledge of their structures are essential. Sirtuins from T. cruzi have been recently considered as promising targets for the development of new treatments for Chagas disease. Inhibition of their activity has been shown to significantly interfere with the life cycle of the parasite. T. cruzi possesses genes encoding two sirtuin-like proteins, TcSIR2rp1 and TcSIR2rp3. The structures of these enzymes were theoretically elucidated in this work, which also focused on the impact of their possible conformational states on computational interaction studies. A small library of phytochemicals that are active against the parasite was built and screened against the most meaningful conformations, identifying a restricted number of scaffolds that potentially interact with the modeled proteins. For these hits, a mechanism of action related to interactions with sirtuins was proposed.
