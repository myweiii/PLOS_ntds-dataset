Scrub typhus is a potentially fatal disease affecting at least 1 million people yearly, with 1 billion at risk in the Asia-Pacific region. Caused by the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, which is transmitted by mites, people with more outdoor activities, like farmers and construction workers, often low-income populations, are at higher risk. The interaction between the bacteria and cells in the patient triggers inflammatory responses, including production of several cytokines, representing both beneficial and detrimental effects to the host. In order to develop better treatment and even a vaccine, we need a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease. The current study was aimed at comparing levels of inflammatory mediators in scrub typhus patients, including recovered patients, in order to map the broader cytokine profile and see how this can be related to disease severity and clinical outcome. Our findings suggest that scrub typhus is characterized by a specific cytokine profile that includes dysregulated levels of a wide range of inflammatory mediators. Further studies on this issue may lead to much-needed new therapeutic targets and prognostic markers in scrub typhus patients.
