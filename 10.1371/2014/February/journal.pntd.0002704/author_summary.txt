Since the 1990s the World Health Organisation has established the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) as a metric for the burden of human disease and injury. However, disease burden has primarily been estimated at the national scale, which does not account for sub-country variations in burden levels. We used the case of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a highly focal NTD, in Uganda to calculate and map burden in DALYs. Our results show that HAT burden is highly sensitive to under-reporting estimates, and is particularly high in heavily affected parishes and districts of Uganda. Some districts in southeastern Uganda had HAT burden rates comparable to the national burden rates of major infectious diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS. Thus, the spatial scale of burden estimation is crucial, especially for focal diseases such as HAT, and national-level estimates may not reflect the level of impact in afflicted communities. We recommend sub-country burden estimation to identify key areas for prioritization of disease surveillance and targeted interventions.
