Treatment options against whipworm infections of humans and livestock are very limited and even anthelmintics recently introduced into the market do not significantly improve the situation. Here, we evaluated members of two relatively new drug classes, the aminophenylamidines (amidantel, deacylated amidantel, tribendimidine) and the cyclooctadepsipeptides (PF1022A, emodepside) in a murine trichurosis model. While tribendimidine is licensed for the treatment of human helminthosis caused by hookworms, pinworms and roundworms in China, emodepside is the nematocidal component of dewormers for cats and dogs. With the exception of amidantel, all drugs showed good efficacies against adult whipworms using three consecutive doses. Due to considerations regarding drug safety and price, PF1022A was further evaluated against histotropic first and second stage larvae, further developed larvae, immature and mature adults using a single or three consecutive doses. Three doses eliminated all stages while a single dose was inefficient against histotropic first stage larvae. In general, higher doses were required for early stages in comparison to stages protruding into the gut lumen. Since only a very basic formulation of drugs was tested, further improvement can be expected from optimized formulations. Cyclooctadepsipeptides should therefore be considered as candidates for evaluation to treat Trichuris spp. infections in livestock and humans.
