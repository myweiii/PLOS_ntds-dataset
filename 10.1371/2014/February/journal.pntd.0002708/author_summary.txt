Since 2000, some 2 billion preventive chemotherapy treatments have been delivered for lymphatic filariasis (LF), many in areas co-endemic for soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH). A transmission assessment survey (TAS) is recommended to determine if such ‘mass drug administration (MDA)’ for LF can be stopped in a specified evaluation unit. The TAS also provides an opportune platform to simultaneously conduct STH assessments and make informed programmatic decisions about STH control. Through piloting this coordinated TAS and STH survey approach in Benin and Tonga, we found that after 5–6 rounds of annual MDA, STH prevalence was 4.2% in Benin and 13.8–25.6% in Tonga. All infections were light intensity except one moderate A. lumbricoides case in Tonga. Our study highlights that a coordinated strategy is operationally feasible, programmatically relevant, and potentially cost-effective. A more robust sampling methodology for coordinated TAS and STH surveys should be further explored, as well as alternative diagnostic tests for STH.
