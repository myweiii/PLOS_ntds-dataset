Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite which infects 9 million people in Latin America. Currently there is no vaccine to prevent this disease. Therefore, different approaches or alternatives are urgently needed to identify new protective immunogens. Live vaccines are likely to be most effective in inducing protection; however, safety issues associated with their use have been raised. Hence, we genetically manipulated an attenuated strain of T. cruzi as a safety device to rule out the possibility of reversion to the virulent phenotype. The genetically modified parasites were highly susceptible to killing by the complement machinery and presented a reduced propagation and differentiation rate. We have extended these studies to assess, the virulence, immunogenicity and safety of the mutant as an experimental vaccine. Accordingly, we show that genetically modified parasites present attenuated virulence in mice. The genetic alteration was stable and, after long term infection, it did not revert back to wild type form. Furthermore, after challenge with a virulent T. cruzi strain, mutant immunization induces a highly protective response evidenced by significantly lowered parasite density, mortality, spleen weight index and tissue inflammatory response. Our study provides new insights into the host-pathogen interactions and into the use and evaluation of irreversibly gene-deleted live attenuated parasites to protect against Chagas disease.
