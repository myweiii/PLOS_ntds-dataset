Polarized cells are found in many parts of the human body and are characterized by the presence of two distinct plasma membrane domains: the apical domain facing the lumen and the basolateral domain facing the underlying tissues. Polarized epithelial cells line the major cavities of our body, while polarized endothelial cells line the blood-tissue interface, both of which protect our body against the invasion of biological pathogens. Thus, many pathogens have to invade the monolayer of epithelial or endothelial cells in order to establish infection. During infection with Chikungunya virus, a mosquito vector bites a human host and inoculates the virus into the host's bloodstream. In recent epidemics of Chikungunya infection, more severe clinical manifestations such as neurological complications were observed. As such, we studied the infection of Chikungunya virus in polarized cells in an aim to provide explanations for the more severe pathogenesis observed.
