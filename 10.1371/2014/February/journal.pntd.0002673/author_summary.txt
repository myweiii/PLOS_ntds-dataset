Anisakiasis is a zoonosis induced by infection with the Anisakis third-stage larvae, contracted through consumption of thermally unprocessed or lightly processed seafood. Its diagnosis is difficult to suspect in countries where the illness was not previously reported, where it is infrequent, or in the cases of subclinical infections. Therefore, it is of great relevance to conduct epidemiological studies to assess the seroprevalence of anti-Anisakis IgE in populations where this zoonosis is more probable. A cross-sectional pilot study was performed on 500 subjects undergoing routine blood analysis and belonging to the south coast of the Adriatic Sea. The results showed that IgE sensitization to Anisakis, tested by indirect ELISA using recombinant Ani s 1 or Ani s 7 allergens, reached 3.5% in the population of higher fish consumers (islands). All Anisakis positive subjects were high fish consumers, mostly of raw and homemade thermally unprocessed fish prepared in the traditional manner. Most of them reported professional or hobby occupational contact with fishery or fish industry. We demonstrated that in coastal Croatian populations there is a relevant prevalence of Anisakis infections, mainly related to the ingestion of home-made raw fish, underlining the necessity to carry out a wider epidemiological study of Anisakis-induced allergy.
