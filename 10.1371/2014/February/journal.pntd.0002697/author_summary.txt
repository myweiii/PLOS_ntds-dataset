There is only one mass reared laboratory colony of Glossina pallidipes, a vector of human African trypanosomiasis and arguably the main vector of animal African trypanosomiasis in eastern Africa. This colony is the main one used for basic research on this species and is intended to be used for Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) programs for control of field populations. The origins of this colony are not clear and the extent to which it is genetically representative of the species is unknown. Using population genetics analyses to compare the current colony with two potential source populations we have shown that the colony is from the Kenya/Uganda border and that its foundation and establishment in the laboratory were associated with a genetic bottleneck, i.e. reduction of genetic variation due to increased genetic drift in a population of reduced size. As a consequence, the genetic diversity of the colony is lower than that of G. pallidipes field populations.
