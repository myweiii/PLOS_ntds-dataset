Prolonged survival of adult mosquitoes is critical to dengue transmission cycles, particularly because it takes time for the dengue viruses to infect the mosquito midgut, replicate and infect the salivary glands before transmission can occur. Reducing mosquito lifespan is one avenue to fight dengue, and may be achievable using mosquito parasites such as a life-shortening strain of Wolbachia bacteria. We measured the survival rates of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in a village in central Vietnam during the region's three prevailing seasons. In order to predict the ages of wild-caught mosquitoes, we used a method of predicting mosquito age based on the activity of age-responsive genes. We first tested our estimations on mosquitoes that were released into a large field cage that enclosed a house and yard. The survival patterns of mosquitoes in the village differed between seasons, both in terms of the death rate over time and longevity. We estimate that approximately 92 and 64% of the mosquito population survived long enough to transmit dengue during the dry/cool season (January-April) and dry/hot season (May-August), respectively; however, this was reduced to 29% during the wet/cool season (September-December). The relatively high survival of Aedes aegypti year round is likely to be a major contributor to the continuity of dengue transmission in the region and provides rationale for reducing mosquito survival to break the transmission cycle.
