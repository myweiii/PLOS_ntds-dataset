Yellow fever (YF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease that affects humans as well as several species of non-human primates, especially New World monkeys found in South America. Yellow fever virus (YFV) is maintained in a natural cycle involving tree-hole breeding mosquitoes and non-human primates hosts. Because YF is often fatal in susceptible New World monkey populations, sudden die-offs of New World monkeys or epizootics can signal YFV circulation in an environment where humans may be exposed. Surveillance for such events is an important tool to prevent human disease. The state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil was one of the first states to conduct passive and active surveillance for yellow fever virus circulation in non-human primates. During a rapidly-spreading YF outbreak in 2008â€“2009, surveillance for epizootics involving non-human primates informed vaccination of human populations in areas previously free of YF. In this study, we analyzed surveillance data to evaluate vaccine coverage, timeliness of notification, investigation and confirmation of epizootic events in relation to occurrence of human cases of YF. Epizootic surveillance is useful for directing the efforts of vaccine distribution. Prevention of YF in susceptible human populations requires immediate risk communication and implementation of vaccine recommendations after the first reports of epizootic activity when YF is suspected.
