An estimated 50 to 100 million cases of dengue fever occur each year worldwide. Among these, there are 200,000 to 500,000 cases of life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Factors contributing to the development of DHF/DSS are not yet fully identified. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent in Southeast Asian countries where dengue is also endemic. Besides affecting normal function of erythrocytes, G6PD deficiency also affects other cells by causing abnormal cellular redox. Altered redox state of cells may render them less effective in clearing up microbial and viral infections. Here we confirm previous findings that monocytes from G6PD-deficinet individuals support better dengue virus replication. In addition, we show that reduced production of reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species and elevated levels of oxidative stress are responsible for the enhanced viral replication. We suggest that redox imbalance observed in infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals may facilitate dengue transmission and affect clinical outcome. However, a handful of studies carried out in areas where both G6PD deficiency and dengue are endemic, reveal no statistically significant correlation between severity of Dengue and G6PD deficiency. Well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate that G6PD-deficient individuals are at risk of severe dengue.
