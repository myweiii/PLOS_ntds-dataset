Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important public health problem and dogs are the main domestic reservoirs of zoonotic VL which has resulted in an annual incidence of 40,100–75,500 new human cases. Because canine VL chemotherapy is limited by the low efficacy of drugs currently used for human VL treatment, immunotherapy may provide a viable alternative. We used a recombinant cysteine proteinase from L. (L.) infantum chagasi, rLdccys1, in combination with the adjuvant P. acnes for the treatment of naturally infected mongrel dogs from Teresina, Pauí a state in Brazil that has a high incidence of VL. Dogs treated with rLdccys1 showed a significant delayed type hypersensitivity reaction against the recombinant antigen and displayed high serum concentrations of IgG2 and IFN-γ and low concentrations of IgG1 and IL-10. Immunotherapy with rLdccys1 resulted in no increase of the clinical signs of canine VL and an extensive reduction of spleen parasite load. Furthermore, all of the dogs treated with rLdccys1 survived for at least 12 months after treatment, whereas those that received either saline or P. acnes alone died within 3 to 7 months. These findings support the potential of rLdccys1 immunotherapy as an additional option for the treatment of canine VL.
