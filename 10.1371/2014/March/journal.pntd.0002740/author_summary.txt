Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by mosquitos, endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America. Large urban outbreaks of yellow fever have been eliminated in the Americas, where most yellow fever cases result from human exposure to jungle or forested environments. Vaccination is effective but carries a risk of potentially fatal adverse events in a small number of vaccinees. In a large country such as Brazil, vaccination is recommended only in areas where there is a risk of exposure to yellow fever virus. We describe two outbreaks of yellow fever in areas without yellow fever vaccine recommendations. Numerous epizootics, or die-offs of non-human primates, were reported from areas with human cases. In response to the outbreaks and epizootic activity, over five million doses of vaccine were administered in previously unvaccinated populations, resulting in vaccine associated adverse events, six of which were fatal. The outbreaks resulted in expansion of areas with yellow fever vaccine recommendations, and highlight the need for safer yellow fever vaccines.
