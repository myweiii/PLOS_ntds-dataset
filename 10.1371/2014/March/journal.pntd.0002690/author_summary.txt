Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immunologically mediated complication of leprosy. It is a painful debilitating multi-system condition which can occur before, during or after completion of treatment of the multi-drug therapy for leprosy. ENL is often a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment often with oral corticosteroids or thalidomide. This study shows that in Ethiopia (where thalidomide is not available) there is a significant mortality associated with ENL. It appears that much of the mortality is attributable to adverse effects of corticosteroids. This study provides additional evidence of the need for alternative agents to manage ENL particularly when thalidomide is not available, contraindicated or unaffordable.
