Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans which affects mainly children in West Africa. Although it is commonly believed that the infection originates from an environmental source, both the reservoir of M. ulcerans and the mode of transmission to human patients remain to be elucidated. Previous investigations indicated that transmission likely takes place away from the homes of patients. We therefore screened the farms as well as village and farm water locations of 46 laboratory confirmed BU patients of the Map√© Basin of Cameroon for the presence of M. ulcerans DNA by real-time PCR. In this analysis three positive village water locations were identified. By studying one of these locations in great detail we found that M. ulcerans DNA persists in underwater detritus in one section of the village water location even after all local cases had been treated. The detritus may represent a reservoir of M. ulcerans from where infection could take place through either direct contamination of skin lesions or through contamination or colonization of insect vectors.
