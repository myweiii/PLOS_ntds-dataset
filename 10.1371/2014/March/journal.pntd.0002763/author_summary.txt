Chagas disease is an important parasitic disease transmitted by triatomine bugs. Current prevention efforts are based on eliminating triatomines from homes to reduce disease transmission to humans. However, the success of these control interventions depends on their acceptability and value to affected communities. We aimed to identify opportunities for and barriers to triatomine control strategies in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We used a sequence of group discussion, interviews, and a survey to investigate the perception and knowledge of communities on Chagas disease and triatomines in three villages from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. Inhabitants are rather familiar with triatomine bugs, but do not associate well these bugs with Chagas disease and its clinical manifestations. Mosquito rather than triatomine control is a common preoccupation, and households frequently use insecticide spray, mosquito coils and plug-in repellents, spending about $32 US per year on these products. Alternative methods such as yard cleaning and window screens are perceived as desirable and potentially more effective. Screens are nonetheless described as unaffordable. The promotion of education campaigns and possibly financing schemes could help families to redirect their current spending from insecticide products to window screens. Also, synergism with mosquito control efforts should be further explored to motivate community involvement and ensure sustainability of Chagas disease vector control.
