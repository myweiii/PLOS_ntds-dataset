Leishmaniasis is a disease complex of various clinical manifestations caused by infection with protozoan parasites (Leishmania spp). It is transmitted through the bite of infected sand flies (Phlebotomus or Lutzomyia spp) and dogs are the main reservoir host for the Leishmania infantum species described previously in Georgia. It is prevalent in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In Georgia, visceral leishmaniasis has been known to occur in the East and in the capital, Tbilisi, but to date no investigation of vectors, and of prevalence in humans and in canines, has been conducted. Here, we report 5 different species of sand fly in Tbilisi and 3 in the West-Georgian city of Kutaisi, with infected vectors found in both places. In some districts of Tbilisi more than a quarter of pet dogs were seropositive for Leishmania parasites; prevalence in stray dogs was somewhat lower. Even in Kutaisi, where no leishmaniasis has previously been reported, 17.3% of pet dogs tested positive. This was reflected in high prevalence of infection in humans in the capital (14.5% overall), compared to 7.3% in Kutaisi. We conclude that the infection rate with visceral leishmaniasis in Georgia is alarmingly high and that its transmission has significantly spread west-wards in recent times.
