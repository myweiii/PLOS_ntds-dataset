Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected disease of increasing worldwide importance. In Brazil, the protozoan parasites which cause visceral leishmaniasis are transmitted through blood-feeding of the female sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. As no human vaccine is available against VL, new tools for targeting sand flies are urgently needed to reduce transmission. Here, we develop and test a new tool for controlling L. longipalpis: a long-lasting lure, which releases a synthetic sex pheromone that attracts both male and female L. longipalpis. Through a series of field experiments conducted in SÃ£o Paulo state, we show that these lures can attract female L. longipalpis for up to 10 weeks from first use, and males for up to 12 weeks. This technology could be applied by disease control agencies to attract sand flies away from feeding on people and their animals, and towards insecticide treated surfaces where they can be killed. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a feasible insect sex pheromone technology that could be applied as part of a programme designed to protect against a human disease.
