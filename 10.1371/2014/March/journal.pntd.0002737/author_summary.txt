Toxoplasmosis is a protozoan parasitic disease commonly transmitted and propagated by cats as family pets. Infection acquired during pregnancy can lead to congenital abnormalities in the fetus, still birth or intrauterine death. Seroprevalence and incidence of toxoplasmosis in Indian women of child bearing age has remained a contentious issue. Different laboratories have used different patient recruitment criteria, methods and variable results, making these data unreliable. There is no published pan-India seroprevalence study. Hence, a seroprevalence study was undertaken comprising 1464 women of reproductive age representing four distinct geographical regions of India. This resulted in an estimated prevalence of 22.4% (328); the highest prevalence being in South India (37.3%) followed by East India (21.2%) and North India (19.7%). West Indian women had the lowest seroprevalence (8.8%). This difference was highly significant. In our analysis we determined the possible risk-factors of infection in these women. These included lower socioeconomic status, residing in mud plastered houses, consumption of raw salad, drinking untreated water, owning pets and advanced age. Overall, the incidence rate of toxoplasmosis was 1.43%. Extrapolating the data, we estimate that between 56,737 and 176,882 children a year may be born in India with a possible risk of congenital toxoplasmosis, which can manifest itself in-utero or several years after birth.
