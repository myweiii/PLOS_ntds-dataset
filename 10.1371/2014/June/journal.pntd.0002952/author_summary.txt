Plaque Reduction Neutralization Tests (PRNTs) remain the most popular approach to characterize an individual's ability to neutralize dengue viruses and are widely used in both epidemiological studies and vaccine trials. However, the underlying variability in the assay is poorly understood, hindering the interpretation of PRNT titer estimates. Further, there is little standardization of its use across laboratories limiting our ability to compare results across settings. Here we used many repeated experiments on the same serum under identical laboratory conditions to estimate the variance in titer measurements. We also identified both the optimum PRNT evaluation point and statistical model to calculate titers. By providing an estimate of the variability in the assay, laboratories will be able to provide a confidence bound on individual PRNT readings. In addition by providing recommended statistical approaches that could be used across laboratories, our findings will help the standardization of the assay across settings.
