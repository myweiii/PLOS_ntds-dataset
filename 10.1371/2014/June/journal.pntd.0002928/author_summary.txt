There is increasing evidence that in the tropics bacterial pyoderma and life-threatening downstream complications caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are often linked with scabies infestation. The bacteria were commonly thought to find easy entry into the skin, damaged by scabies mites. However, there may be more to it. Our study aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between mites and bacteria. We recently characterized a molecule (SMSB4) that the mite produces for self-protection from the immediate host defense system in the skin. We show here that SMSB4 reduces the uptake of S. aureus by neutrophils, which are the killer immune cells, first to arrive at the infection site. These cells are guided by a number of complement factors. SMSB4 reduces the deposition of several complement components on the bacteria surface, thereby interrupting the essential defense cascades and inhibiting further neutrophil recruitment to the site. In summary, a mite molecule that likely originally evolved to protect the mite against the host defense plays a further role in the pathogenesis of secondary infections: when secreted into the damaged skin it promotes the onset of S. aureus infection thereby increasing the prevalence of debilitating disease associated with scabies.
