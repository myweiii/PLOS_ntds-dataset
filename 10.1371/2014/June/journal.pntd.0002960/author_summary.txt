Globally, more than 10 million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The emergence and perpetuation of Chagas disease in some endemic countries, such as Ecuador, depends largely on sylvatic populations of T. cruzi-infected vectors that frequently infest houses after insecticide treatment thereby hampering long-term control prospects in vast geographical areas. Our study describes, for the first time in an agricultural landscape, how the temporal dynamics of sylvatic vector, host, and pathogen populations interact spatially in a farming community of coastal Ecuador. In particular, we found that land cover changes due to both farming activities and vegetation phenology affect rodent host distribution and consequently the relative abundance of vectors involved in the transmission cycle of T. cruzi.
