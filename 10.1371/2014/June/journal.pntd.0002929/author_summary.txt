The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is a vector of several medically-important arboviruses and one of the most invasive mosquito species in the world. Existing control measures for mosquitoes are presently being challenged by the emergence of resistance to insecticides that target the nervous system. Thus, it is necessary to identify novel physiological targets to guide the development of new insecticides. We recently demonstrated that the ‘kidneys’ (Malpighian tubules) of mosquitoes offer a valuable, new physiological target for insecticides. However, our understanding of how this tissue contributes to the chronic metabolic processing of blood meals by mosquitoes is limited. Here we characterize the changes in transcript expression that occur in the Malpighian tubules of adult female A. albopictus with the goal of identifying key molecular pathways that may reveal valuable targets for insecticide development. We find dramatic changes in transcript accumulation in Malpighian tubules, which 1) provide new insights into the potential functional roles of Malpighian tubules after a blood meal, and 2) reveal new potential molecular pathways and targets to guide the development of new insecticides that would disrupt the renal functions of mosquitoes.
