Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disease affecting about 12 million people worldwide. It is transmitted by a sand fly and primarily affects people in developing countries. To date there are no effective vaccines. Many of the treatments available have serious side effects and resistance mechanisms are becoming an increasingly prevalent problem. Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique T cell population recognizing glycolipids. Their role in immune processes, especially in infectious diseases, is incompletely understood. In the current study, we investigated the role of NKT cells in Leishmania infections in detail. We found that NKT cells can significantly alter the development of immunity, however in different directions depending on the host's genetic background. Their natural effect on infection can be increased when applying the stimulating antigen alpha-Galactosyl-Ceramide (Î±GalCer) or its analogs (in our study PBS57). Our results show that the effect of these cells in resistant mice (which are generally reminiscent of the situation in humans) is largely mediated by cytokine secretion, in particular IL-4, a Th2 cytokine. We conclude that NKT cells influence the course of Leishmania infection and that therapeutically modulating their function could be beneficial both to treat existing infections, as well as potentially develop desperately needed, effective vaccines.
