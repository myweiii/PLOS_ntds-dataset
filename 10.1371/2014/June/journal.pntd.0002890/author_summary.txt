Naja sumatrana is a medically important cobra species in Southeast Asia. The optimization of snakebite management and the use of antivenom depend greatly on the knowledge of the venom's composition, its biological activities, as well as its pharmacokinetics. The present study on the pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom shows that the systemic bioavailability of this venom in experimental envenomation is similar to N. sputatrix venom determined in an earlier study. The neurotoxin and cardiotoxin exhibited a more rapid absorption and elimination compared to the phospholipase A2 and the whole venom. The venom neurotoxin produced a higher systemic bioavailability than the cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2, suggesting that the neurotoxin plays the major toxic role in cobra bites.
