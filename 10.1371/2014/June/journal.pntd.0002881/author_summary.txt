Intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD) is the key event in development of hepatopulmonary syndrome, an arterial oxygenation defect in patients with portal hypertension. IPVD diagnosis can be made by EchoDopplercardiography or 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin scintigraphy (99mTc-MAA), and ethiopatogeny is still unknown. In Northeastern Brazil, hepatosplenic schistossomiasis (HSS) is the main cause of portal hypertension. In cirrhotics, the presence of IPVD influences survival and candidacy for liver transplantation, however, in HSS patients, IPVD has been poorly studied, specially using lung perfusion scan with 99mTc-MAA. Some authors believe that IPVD is common in HSS and in the existence of differences in indirect portal hypertension parameters between patients with and without IPVD. All patients were distributed into two groups according to presence or not of IPVD, and laboratorial, endoscopy and ultrasound tests were perfomed. Occurrence of IPVD was high and was associated with lower splenic vein diameter, which can be a vascular protection mechanism against portal hypertension status.
