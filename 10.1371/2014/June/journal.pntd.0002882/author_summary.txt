Plasmodium vivax is capable of remaining dormant in the human liver for months to years after an initial infection, creating an asymptomatic human reservoir. This unique aspect of parasite biology makes eliminating P. vivax distinctly different from P. falciparum elimination, and yet very little is known about this dormant parasite stage. Lack of knowledge about the dormant liver stage prevents the creation of new drugs and public health interventions directed at P. vivax. In order to better understand this particular parasite stage, we used whole genome sequencing to analyze three sequential P. vivax infections, two of which could be definitively categorized as having arisen from dormant liver stages. Our whole genome sequencing data demonstrates that dormant liver stage parasites are closely related yet not, as had previously been postulated, identical. These data highlight the need for a new paradigm to investigate P. vivax dormant liver stages in order to design the next generation of P. vivax drugs and effective global health interventions.
