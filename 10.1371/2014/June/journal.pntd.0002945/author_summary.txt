Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are pervasive enteric parasites that lead to cognitive, nutritional and educational sequelae. Mass drug administration is employed to reduce morbidity, but reinfection occurs rapidly in the absence of changes to other environmental conditions, such as improvements to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Since WASH behaviors and conditions are highly interrelated, typical epidemiological methods are limited. Few rigorous studies have assessed the impact of WASH components as they complement deworming and even fewer have sought to prioritize among the available indicators or identify complex interactions. In this paper we introduce two recursive partitioning approaches: classification and regression trees (C&RT) and conditional inference trees (CIT). We demonstrate these two tools using data from a school-based cluster-randomized trial conducted in Kenya. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each tool and give examples of how they may be used to improve STH control programs.
