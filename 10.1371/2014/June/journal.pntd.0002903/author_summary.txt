Anthrax is a neglected zoonotic disease affecting livestock, wildlife, and humans in developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, and it occurs regularly in rural parts of North America. The causative agent of anthrax, Bacillus anthracis is transmitted by spores that persist for long periods of time in the environment. The transmission mechanisms of socioeconomically important and environmentally maintained pathogens are poorly understood, yet essential for understanding disease dynamics and devising appropriate control measures. Recent laboratory studies show that B. anthracis interacts with plants and other soil-dwelling organisms that may affect its survival and transmission. In this paper, we describe the results of a field experiment designed to test whether the interaction of B. anthracis with plants might affect its persistence and potential transmission to grazing hosts. We found that like some of its close relatives, B. anthracis promotes plant growth. Rather than simply lying in wait as a dormant spore in soil, instead B. anthracis may promote plant growth as a way of attracting hosts to graze on infectious material at carcass sites.
