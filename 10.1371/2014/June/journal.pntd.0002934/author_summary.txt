Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) and Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) are tick-borne flaviviruses that cause severe hemorrhagic disease in humans. The pathogenesis of the disease is still not very well understood mostly due to the lack of suitable animal models. Despite sharing a high degree of genetic sequence similarity, KFDV replicates primarily in the brain and is uniformly lethal for BALB/c mice. In contrast, AHFV does not cause clinically overt signs in mice, replicates in the visceral organs, and induces pro-inflammatory cytokines and hematological changes. Given the striking differences in pathogenesis and tissue tropism, the use of inbred mice as well as the passage history of the virus needs to be carefully considered in the interpretation of animal studies using these viruses.
