Blood feeding arthropods—like mosquitoes and black flies—have evolved salivary secretions rich in molecules that affect hemostasis, including vasodilators and inhibitors of blood clotting and platelet aggregation. Among the platelet inhibitors, antagonists of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and adhesion have been found in salivary glands of blood feeders. Here we report the first collagen-binding protein from salivary glands of a black fly. This molecule prevents thrombosis in mice without causing significant bleeding, making it an attractive candidate as an antithrombotic agent. Because blackflies and mosquitoes shared a common blood feeding ancestor approximately 250 million years ago, it appears that collagen-binding activity in salivary glands was an evolutionary innovation present in an ancient dipteran ancestor. Our work highlights the central role of inhibition of platelet aggregation as a vital salivary function in blood feeding arthropods.
