We sincerely thank Sonoyo Itoh who helped with the serological analysis and Christine Budke who gave us suggestions and comments, and amended the MS in English. We dedicate this article to Dr. Narantuya Bazarragchaa (Oct 03, 1960 – Aug 01, 2011), a surgeon who worked at the SCFH as the head of Department and contributed greatly to the 2009 meeting in UB [27] and the present project. Akira Ito also dedicates this article to Prof. John H. Cross (Sept 25, 1925 – Nov 19, 2010), a great American parasitologist who dedicated his life to the service of others and inspired and encouraged numerous researchers, including many parasitologists in Southeast Asia. Ito had the opportunity to work with Prof. Cross in China and Mongolia since 1991 and 1995, respectively.
