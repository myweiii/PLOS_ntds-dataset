Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most dangerous form of human leishmaniasis in terms of mortality and morbidity and is spreading to several non-endemic areas because of global traveling and military conflicts. The emergence of Leishmania-HIV coinfection and increased prevalence of drug resistant strains have compounded an already bad situation. In addition, the drugs available are toxic, expensive and have several side effects. Therefore, a detailed understanding of protective immune response is extremely important in order to identify new therapeutic targets. The phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) family of enzymes mediate several important immunologic and physiologic cellular process including proliferation, differentiation, growth and host defense. We previously showed that genetic inactivation of the p110δ isoform of PI3K results in resistant to L. major (the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)). Here, we investigate the role of PI3K in immunity to VL and the mechanisms underlying its protective effect. Collectively, our results demonstrate that signaling via the p110δ also regulates immunity to L. donovani, an effect that is dependent on the impact of p110δ signaling on expansion and function of regulatory T cells in vivo. Thus, our studies suggest that targeting the p110δ pathway may be a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling VL and CL.
