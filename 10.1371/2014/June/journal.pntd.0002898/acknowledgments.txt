The authors would like to thank all the staff who took part in patient care, field investigations, data reporting as well as sample collection, transport, processing and analysis. In particular, the authors are indebted to Leonard Heyerdahl (AMP, France), who took part in organizing the prospective sampling of clinical cholera samples. This study wouldn't have been possible without H Diallo (INSP, Guinea) who performed initial vibrio cultures, the staff of HIA Laveran who cultured and performed the MLVA in Marseille and the staff of Aix-Marseille Universit√© who sequenced and analyzed the V. cholerae clone. The authors are also grateful to Bertrand Sudre, who provided critical comments on the manuscript.
