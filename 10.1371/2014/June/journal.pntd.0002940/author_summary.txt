A total of 135 leprosy affected persons were interviewed with a questionnaire containing EMIC questions designed to assess the level of perceived stigma and the questionnaire containing variables for socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge about leprosy and the clinical presentations of the participants. Clinical presentation as disability was graded according to WHO guidelines, where grade 0 means no disability found, grade I means loss of sensation has been noted in the hand or foot while grade II means visible damage or disability. Total EMIC score was analyzed between sub-variables to see the factors associated with the higher level of perceived stigma score. Additionally, among the total participants, we included 20 of them who were admitted at hospital for various reasons. Two sets of focus group discussions were conducted with additional questions to derive the reasons behind frequently affected EMIC stigma domains. The factors associated with higher perceived stigma score were illiteracy (those who could not read and write), perceived economical inadequacy, lack of knowledge on leprosy, the perceptions as difficult to treat and severe disease and presence of visible deformities and ulcers. Considering our findings pertaining to higher perceived stigma, there is an urgent need of stigma reduction strategies which should focus on health education about leprosy that can change the perceived stigma in leprosy.
