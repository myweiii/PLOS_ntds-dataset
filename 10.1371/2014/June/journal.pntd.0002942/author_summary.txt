Madurella mycetomatis is the most common etiologic agent of eumycetoma worldwide. Treatment of this infection is very difficult and associated with high recurrence rates and low cure rates. Currently the treatment consists of a combination of surgery and antifungal therapy. Antifungal therapy is usually given for at least one year. However, the commonly used antifungal ketoconazole is too expensive for many patients in endemic countries and has many side effects. In the present study we evaluated the in vitro activity of the new antifungal agent ravuconazole against M. mycetomatis. The drug showed excellent in vitro activity against all tested strains and its prodrug, E1224, might be a potential new therapeutic option for eumycetoma caused by M. mycetomatis.
