Parasitic blood flukes, also called schistosomes, cause human schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease and major public health problem in developing countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa. Sustainable control of schistosomiasis is difficult, mainly because the complex life cycle of the parasite involves a freshwater snail host, and the ability of the parasite to evade the immune response of the human host and to survive for many years. Little is yet known about the cellular mechanisms in schistosomes and how they regulate parasite homeostasis, development and behaviour. In this paper, the nature of intracellular signalling by protein kinases C (PKCs) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) in schistosomes is studied and these proteins are found to be vital for the coordination of processes fundamental to parasite survival, such as muscular activity and reproductive function. Our results contribute to an understanding of molecular events regulating schistosome function and identify PKCs and ERKs as possible targets for the development of new chemotherapeutic treatments against schistosomiasis.
