Around 100 million Africans live in onchocerciasis endemic areas. Control of onchocerciasis as a public health problem and possibly even elimination of onchocerciasis infection relies on annual community-directed mass treatment with ivermectin. Given concerns about possible emergence of ivermectin resistance of the parasite Onchocerca volvulus and elimination of infection in areas where very high numbers of vectors can result in continued parasite transmission even when only few parasites are present in only a few people, research for drugs with higher effect on the parasite remains important. A series of non-clinical and clinical studies was planned to find out whether moxidectin, a veterinary anthelminthic, is sufficiently safe for mass treatment and has a better effect on the parasite than ivermectin. We report here results from the first study in infected people conducted to assess in small numbers of individuals the adverse reactions to the killing of parasites by moxidectin. A single dose of 8 mg moxidectin reduced skin parasite numbers better and for a longer time than ivermectin. The frequency and severity of adverse reactions was so low that a larger study to better characterize the adverse reactions to moxidectin and compare its efficacy with that of ivermectin was initiated.
