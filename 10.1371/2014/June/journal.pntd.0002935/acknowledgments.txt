We would like to thank Prof. James Smith, Dr. Lawrence Dritsas and Dr. Tiziana Lembo for helpful discussions and comments as well as Prof. Rudovick Kazwala and Dr. Helena Ngowi for their support in Tanzania. We would also like to thank our research assistants for help in the field and the many local leaders who assisted in organising fieldwork. Special thanks are due to the residents and officials of Kilombero and Ulanga who took time to candidly discuss their opinions and views with us.
