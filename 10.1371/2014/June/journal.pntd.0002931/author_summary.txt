Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a fatal parasitic disease of humans. Domestic cattle act as reservoirs for T.b. rhodesiense HAT. In a survey of cattle in Ugandan villages; six that had a reported HAT case in the previous six months, and six which did not, an association was detected between presence of HAT in a village and infection of village cattle with human infective parasites. Village HAT status was significant (p<0.05) for detection of T.b. rhodesiense in the village herd, with significantly greater likelihood of T.b. rhodesiense in herds from case villages (OR:25,95%CI:1.2–520.71). T. brucei s.l. prevalence of over 16.3% in cattle was associated with significantly greater likelihood of T.b. rhodesiense infection within the herd (OR:25, 95%CI:1.2–520.71). Cattle age had a significant effect (p<0.001) on the likelihood of a T. brucei s.l. infection: cattle between 18–36 months (OR:3.51,95%CI:1.63–7.51) and over 36 months (OR:4.20,95%CI:2.08–8.67) had significantly higher rates of T. brucei s.l. than animals under 18 months of age. Cattle are long-term reservoirs of T.b. rhodesiense that will outlive control strategies that do not directly eliminate parasite infection. T.b. rhodesiense and/or elevated T. brucei s.l. prevalence in village herds can serve as an indicator for HAT risk.
