Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). It is endemic in Latin America and affects 10 million people worldwide. Meningoencephalitis occurs in children with acute CD and in immunosuppressed patients suffering acute CD reactivation. During the chronic phase, cerebral manifestations, including ischemic stroke and cognitive impairment, can also occur. Although microvascular alterations have been implicated in Chagas cardiomyopathy, the main clinical form of the disease, there is a lack of discussion in some studies regarding alterations of the cerebral microcirculation in CD. In the present study, we evaluated the functionality of the cerebral microcirculation in mice infected by T. cruzi. Utilizing an intravital video-microscope, we observed in the brain of infected mice a reduction in the number of perfused capillaries, an increased interaction between inflammatory cells and venules, the presence of microvascular platelet-leukocyte aggregates and alterations in the dilatation capacity of arterioles. Moreover, cerebral oxidative stress was increased in infected animals. We concluded that acute CD induced cerebral microvasculopathy.
