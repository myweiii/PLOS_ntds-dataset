Trichinellosis is one of the most widely distributed parasitic zoonoses worldwide and is caused by infection with nematodes of the genus Trichinella. Infection occurs after consuming larvae in the muscle of infected animals. Several outbreaks of trichinellosis have occurred in Laos since 2004, resulting in a substantial public health problem. The principal risk factor for trichinellosis is consumption of uncooked or partially cooked meat from domestic pigs and game. We visited communities in four ethnically diverse provinces of northern Laos to determine the seroprevalence of trichinellosis in the human population and explore the population and individual level risk factors of exposure. In addition, we also examined muscle samples collected from pigs post-slaughter to determine the prevalence of Trichinella infection and identify the species of Trichinella circulating in the domestic pig population. Our findings indicate that Trichinella spp. are endemic in the domestic environment of northern Laos and consumption of uncooked pork is common for all ethnic groups. Targeted preventative health measures, taking a one health approach by bringing together medical, veterinary and health sociology professionals, should be initiated to prevent the transmission of Trichinella and other foodborne pathogens in Laos.
