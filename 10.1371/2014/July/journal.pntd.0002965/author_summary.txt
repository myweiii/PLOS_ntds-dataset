Current methods to control mosquitoes and the pathogens they transmit are ineffective, partly due to insecticide and drug resistance. One novel control method involves exploiting naturally occurring Wolbachia bacteria in insects. Wolbachia are bacterial symbionts that are attractive candidates for mosquito-borne disease control due to their ability to inhibit pathogens infecting humans. Additionally, Wolbachia affects insect reproduction to facilitate its own transmission to offspring, which has been exploited to establish the bacterium in naturally uninfected field populations. Most Wolbachia pathogen control research has focused on Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes, but Culex mosquitoes also transmit pathogens that affect human health. We evaluated impacts of Wolbachia infection on West Nile virus (WNV) in the naturally uninfected mosquito Culex tarsalis. Wolbachia was able to efficiently establish infection in Cx. tarsalis but contrary to other studies, Wolbachia enhanced rather than inhibited WNV infection. Enhancement occurred in conjunction with suppression of mosquito anti-viral immune gene expression. This study indicates that Wolbachia control strategies to disrupt WNV via pathogen interference may not be feasible in Cx. tarsalis, and that caution should be used when releasing Wolbachia infected mosquitoes to control human vector-borne diseases.
