Although vertical transmission of arboviruses has been recognized for nearly a century, rates of transmission in laboratory experiments are low and their significance in terms of survival of virus during periods of low transmission appears debatable. Recently, major urban outbreaks of chikungunya have been recorded in many parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. The occurrence of random sporadic cases of the disease in years following a major outbreak prompted us to investigate whether these might be attributable to survival of the virus by vertical transmission. Our experiments were designed to test two hypotheses: (1) The development of an egg-batch derived from an infectious blood meal is too rapid for the infection to reach ovaries; (2) The enormous distension of the membrane enveloping ovaries and ovarioles following oviposition, might facilitate virus penetration. We conclude that after the infected blood meal, oogenesis and oviposition were complete before virus had disseminated to infect the ovaries. Because similar experiments with infection in first gonotrophic cycle did not lead to infected progenies, it is presumed that expanded parous ovaries might support efficient infection. Therefore, it may be concluded that vertical transmission is a more common phenomena in mosquitoes during subsequent gonotrophic cycles following arboviral infection.
