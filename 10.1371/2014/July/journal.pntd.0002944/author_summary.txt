A field-friendly screening tool to simplify serological diagnosis of neurocysticercosis was developed. The assay utilizes a rapid lateral flow based test platform in combination with unique fluorescent label, up-converting phosphor (UCP) reporter particles. The UCP reporter technology uses infrared excitation and emission of higher energy visible light. Total absence of autofluorescence provides the label with a distinctive advantage compared to common fluorescent labels. The developed assay detects antibodies against an established marker for detecting neurocysticercosis cases, recombinant T24H. In this study rT24H was produced by a bacterial expression system, a less cumbersome method compared to the previously used baculovirus expression system. With a sample set comprised of 63 confirmed neurocysticercosis cases and 170 healthy controls, clinical sensitivity and specificity were 96% and 98%, respectively. The study shows proof-of-principle that the designed UCP-rT24H assay can provide an on-site rapid screening method utilizing a mobile lightweight scanner and 40 nm yttrium fluoride UCP particles. A semi-handheld UCP reader and nano-sized UCP particles performed as good as previously used ‘research and development’-only tools. Availability of commercial sources for UCP reporter materials as well as the accessibility to affordable scanners may allow UCP-based bioanalytical systems for point-of-care to evolve at an even faster pace.
