In contrast to other clinical presentations of leishmaniasis in Latin America, American visceral leishmaniasis (VL) can lead to death in 5-10% of patients under treatment. The fatality rates associated with this disease have remained stable at a high level over the years in Brazil and are neither recorded in under-treatment patients from endemic countries of the Old World nor from non-endemic countries where such cases are imported. Since VL-induced lethality can occur even after the implementation of recommended therapy, the understanding of individual, clinical and laboratory factors that predispose to an unfavorable outcome might represent an important feature for informing better practice in the clinical management of cases. The present systematic review with meta-analysis brings together information on various prognostic variables associated with the severity of VL. Potential predictors identified in the studies surveyed were grouped according to the strength of evidence available, and 13 were considered to be of significant relevance. The gaps in the existing knowledge and the need for the development of externally validated prognostic models were also discussed. The results presented herein could be useful in identifying patients at higher risk of unfavorable evolution or death from VL, and might provide an aid in decision-making regarding the clinical management of VL cases.
