Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) is mainly caused by the agent Leishmania (V.) brasiliensis and usually occurs months or years after symptomatic or asymptomatic skin infection. Approximately 5% of patients with untreated cutaneous leishmaniasis will develop ML, a presentation that causes significant morbidity in patients. This important but often neglected anthropozoonosis also presents direct health care costs and several indirect losses in terms of impaired daily functioning. In this study, we aimed to assess the degree of opacification of the paranasal sinuses in patients with treated ML and any anatomical changes in the face associated with ML using multidetector computed tomography scans (MDCT) of the sinuses. We compared the findings in this population with those from a control group. We evaluated 54 patients with treated ML who were subjected to MDCT of the sinuses and compared them with a control group of 40 patients who underwent MDCT of the orbit. CT scans of the sinus of patients with ML presented several structural alterations, revealing a prominent destructive feature of the disease. The higher prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis observed in CT scans of patients with treated ML in this study also suggests that ML can be considered a risk factor for chronic rhinosinusitis in this population.
