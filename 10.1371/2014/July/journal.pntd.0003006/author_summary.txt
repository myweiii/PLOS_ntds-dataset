Population screening for the chronic form of sleeping sickness or gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is still based on an antibody detection test against the native variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) LiTat 1.3. This protein is produced through massive infections of lab animals with highly virulent parasites. We aim to replace this native antigen with recombinant VSGs, both LiTat 1.3 and LiTat 1.5, expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The diagnostic potential of these recombinants was confirmed in ELISA with sera from HAT patients and negative controls. Replacement of the native LiTat 1.3 VSG with these recombinants would prevent the infection and sacrifice of lab animals and the inherent infection risk linked to the production of the screening test. Upscaling production of recombinant antigens, e.g. in biofermentors, is straightforward thus leading to improved standardisation of antigen production and reduced production costs, which on their turn will increase the availability and affordability of the diagnostic tests needed for the elimination of gambiense HAT.
