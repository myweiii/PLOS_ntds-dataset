Filarial parasites commonly infect humans and animals, especially in tropical settings. The strongly debilitating panel of diseases they cause in humans contributes to an entrenched cycle of poverty. For efficient treatment strategies, reliable diagnostic tests are necessary. We investigated the potential of parasite-derived microRNAs (miRNAs; short non-coding RNA molecules present in eukaryotes) as biomarkers of infection. Using deep-sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, we identified over two-hundred mature miRNA candidates of nematode origin in plasma from Dirofilaria immitis-infected dogs. Similarly, we discovered twenty-one miRNA candidates predicted to be released by Onchocerca volvulus in infected human sera. We developed two RT-qPCR assays for the detection of D. immitis miR-71 and miR-34 in dog plasma that discriminated infected from uninfected samples. We demonstrated the presence of filarial miRNAs in host blood, regardless of localization in their respective hosts, and suggest that they are suitable targets for detection by RT-qPCR.
