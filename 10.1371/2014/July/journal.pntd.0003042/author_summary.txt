Cryptosporidium spp. is a major cause of childhood diarrhea in India and other developing countries. Because of its link with poverty and its ability to impair childhood growth and development, Cryptosporidium spp. was included in the WHO Neglected Diseases Initiative in 2004. Despite this, the global impact of cryptosporidiosis is yet to be quantified due to the lack of country-specific estimates on cryptosporidial disease burden. In this study, we combined data from community-based studies in Vellore with the national statistics for India to obtain an estimate of the cryptosporidial disease burden in Indian children. Despite the inherent challenges in generating national estimates of disease burden for a country as large and diverse as India, our study provides a useful assessment of the under-recognized burden of cryptosporidiosis in Indian children.
