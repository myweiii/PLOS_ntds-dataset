JE is one of the major public health problems in Asian and the Western Pacific regions, and most cases occur in children under the age of 14 years. A JE virus infection can cause severe sequelae such as an impairment of language ability, cognitive ability, or movement. Because humans are a dead-end host of the JE virus, the disease cannot be transmitted among people. Vaccination is currently the most effective method for preventing JE, and children in most endemic areas are vaccinated. After decades of mass vaccination, the number of confirmed JE cases has considerably declined in Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. Most JE cases have occurred in adults rather than children in these countries, thus, the disease must be controlled by reducing the number of adult JE cases. Therefore, a prevention policy for the adult and elderly population should be implemented in the near future.
