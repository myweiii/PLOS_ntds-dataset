Monitoring the distribution of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is a key to controlling their spread in Africa. Currently, such surveillance is conducted independently for each NTD. To tackle this problem, we developed a microsphere-based system to permit simultaneous measurement of IgG antibody levels for antigens from six infectious diseases: Entamoeba histolytica, Leishmania donovani, Toxoplasma gondii, Wuchereria bancrofti, HIV, and Vibrio cholerae. Using this system, we conducted a serological survey using two health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) areas in coastal and western Kenya. We randomly selected 4,600 individuals according to sex and age group, of whom 3411 agreed to participate in the study. Mathematical analyses of the distributions of the participants' reactivity to each antigen and the reactivity of the sero-positive and -negative controls indicated that this system could be used to monitor infections, especially, those associated with HIV, filariasis, toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis, and amebiasis. For the practical development and eventual implementation of actual programs in Africa, pathogens and antigens of interest can be added to optimize made-to-order monitoring programs.
