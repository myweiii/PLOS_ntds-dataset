Buruli ulcer is an infectious skin disease, mainly occurring in West Africa. It usually starts with a small nodule that over the course of weeks progresses into an ulcer. Effective treatment with antibiotics is available, but patients often report to the hospital late, and there is a serious risk of scarring, contractures and functional limitations of the affected body parts. Although it is often reported that Buruli ulcers can have serious sequelae, the quality of life of former Buruli ulcer patients has not been studied before. In this study we assessed the quality of life of healed Buruli ulcer patients that took part in a drug trial between 2006 and 2009, which only included small and early lesions. On follow-up, we found that most scars were small and functional limitations were rare, and that both general and skin specific Quality of Life was good. Our results demonstrate the potential of the combination of early detection and proper antibiotic treatment of Buruli ulcer and hence stress the importance of public health efforts aimed at diagnosing the disease in its early stage, and providing standardized treatment in endemic areas.
