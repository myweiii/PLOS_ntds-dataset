The antimalarial drug mefloquine shows activity against blood flukes that cause the disease schistosomiasis. In animal studies it has been found that a mefloquine-praziquantel combination kills blood flukes more effectively than praziquantel alone. Combining praziquantel with another drug might therefore increase efficacy, broaden the spectrum of activity, and delay the development of drug resistance. We designed a study in Ivorian school children to assess the efficacy and tolerability of mefloquine and mefloquine-artesunate combined with praziquantel against the blood fluke Schistosoma haematobium. The administration of the antimalarials and praziquantel was spaced by a day. Treatment outcomes were assessed twice, on days 21–22 and 78–79 after the first dosing to determine the effect against adult and juvenile S. haematobium, respectively. At both follow-ups, high reduction in the intensity of infection (egg reduction rates of 94–96%), but low cure rates (26–33%) were observed in the three treatment groups. Adverse events were common, particularly in children treated with mefloquine-praziquantel and mefloquine-artesunate-praziquantel. Our study suggests that the addition of mefloquine and mefloquine-artesunate to praziquantel has no benefit in the treatment of chronic S. haematobium infection. However, further investigations are warranted to evaluate the effect of combination therapy on juvenile flukes and longer-term morbidity profiles.
