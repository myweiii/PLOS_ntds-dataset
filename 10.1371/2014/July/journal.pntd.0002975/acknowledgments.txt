We are grateful to the village chief of Sahoua and the participating children and their parents/guardians. The smooth execution of this study would not have been possible without dedicated efforts from the laboratory technicians as well as the local staff at the Taabo health and demographic surveillance system. We would like to thank Dr. Benjamin Speich for assisting with the statistical analysis.
