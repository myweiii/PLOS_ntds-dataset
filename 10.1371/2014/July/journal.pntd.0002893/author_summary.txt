Lymphatic filariasis is caused by parasitic worms with approximately 120 million people infected worldwide and over 1 billion people at risk. The adult worms reside in host lymphatic vessels (LV) but most infected individuals do not present with overt clinical symptoms. Individuals exhibiting lymphedema, a common form of the disease, are often antigen negative; however, infected individuals, though often asymptomatic, have dilated LVs suggesting that early damage to the lymphatic architecture may lead to lymphedema in these infected individuals. In the LVs, adult worms release excretory-secretory (ES) products. Filarial ES products do not directly activate lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), so we hypothesized that accessory cells may activate LECs indirectly and contribute to the development of disease. Here, we show that adult filarial ES products induce human blood cells, specifically monocytes, to produce lymphangiogenic factors such as IL-8 and VEGF-A and that these factors induce the formation of LVs in vivo. These results support a role for filarial ES products in altering the lymphatic architecture in filarial-infected individuals and this may contribute to LV pathology and the development of lymphedema.
