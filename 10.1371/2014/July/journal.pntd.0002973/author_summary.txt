Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects at least two thirds of the world human population. Once it infects the human host, it has great predilection for the brain and the retina of the eye. It remains latent until the host's immune system weakens, and then causes organ tissue damage. There are very few treatments available that are active against this parasite, and they all fail to eradicate it from the human body. Hence, there is always a risk for recurrence and/or disabling long-term complications such as blindness or neurological abnormalities. Despite this fact, it has been over fifty years since most anti-Toxoplasma agents were initially described. Most recently, in an attempt to expedite the process of drug discovery, older drugs are making a comeback by being re-purposed for new diseases. Auranofin, which was originally designed to treat rheumatoid arthritis, has consistently shown antiparasitic activity against multiple organisms, including parasites of great public health importance such as Plasmodium, Schistosoma and Leishmania, although most of these reports are based on in vitro assays. Herein, we present our studies that demonstrate that auranofin is active against Toxoplasma gondii in vitro and in an animal model of acute Toxoplasma infection, suggesting that auranofin has great potential to become a new anti-Toxoplasma agent.
