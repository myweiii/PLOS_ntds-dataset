The World Health Organization (WHO) recently endorsed the creation of a global oral cholera vaccine (OCV) stockpile as part of an integrated, strategic framework to address the re-emerging threat that cholera causes worldwide. In conjunction, the WHO also called for continued monitoring and evaluation around the use of OCV in different settings. In response to the cholera epidemic in Haiti that began in October 2010, Partners In Health, an implementing partner of Haiti's Ministry of Health, vaccinated 50,000 Haitians in two rural communities in the Artibonite Valley in 2012. In this paper, the authors describe the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology for data collection and geospatial mapping to document this rural OCV campaign, focusing on the utility, benefits, and challenges of mHealth in a reactive campaign in the midst of the ongoing epidemic.
