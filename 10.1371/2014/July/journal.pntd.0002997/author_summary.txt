Giardiasis is a major cause of non-viral/non-bacterial diarrheal disease worldwide and has been included within the WHO Neglected Disease Initiative since 2004. Infection begins with the ingestion of Giardia lamblia in cyst form, which, after exposure to gastric acid in the host stomach and proteases in the duodenum, gives rise to trophozoites. The inverse process is called encystation and begins when the trophozoites migrate to the lower part of the small intestine where they receive signals that trigger synthesis of the components of the cyst wall. The cyst form enables the parasite to survive in the environment, infect a new host and evade the immune response. In this work, we explored the role of protein S-palmitoylation, a unique reversible post-translational modification, during Giardia encystation, because de novo generation of endomembrane compartments, protein sorting and vesicle fusion occur in this process. Our findings may contribute to the design of therapeutic agents against this important human pathogen.
