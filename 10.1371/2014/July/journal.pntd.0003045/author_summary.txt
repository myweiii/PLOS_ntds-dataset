Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes to ruminants. The disease may affect humans and has a great impact on the economy of the affected country. RVF occurs mostly in African countries, but epidemics have been reported in Madagascar and in the Arabian Peninsula. In the Union of Comoros, RVF virus (RVFV) has been suspected of continuously circulating since 2009 without any notifications of the typical clinical signs by the Comorian Animal Health Services. From April 2010 to August 2011, we conducted a livestock longitudinal survey in Grande Comore, Moheli and Anjouan. Our study aimed to detect RVFV-specific antibody acquisitions in cattle and goats. Simultaneously, a longitudinal entomological survey was conducted to describe the diversity of mosquitoes in the study zones and ruminant trade-related information was collected. Our investigations showed that Comoros ruminants acquired RVFV-specific antibodies all along the year and particularly in Moheli during the dry season. Our findings suggest a complex RVFV epidemiological cycle in the Union of Comoros with probable inter-islands differences in RVFV circulation patterns. The disease appears to be endemic in Moheli and potentially Anjouan, but the persistence of the disease in Grande Comore could be correlated with trade in live animals with the eastern coast of Africa.
