Ocular pentastomiasis is a severely neglected parasitic disease. Most human infections are linked to the consumption and/or handling of snakes. Here we present a series of cases from a remote area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Two patients had an infection with Armillifer grandis. As livestock production in Congo Basin countries is limited, people consume “bushmeat” from wild animals, including snakes. On the other hand, developed countries increasingly import reptiles from tropical countries as pet animals, which represents a potential threat to the public. Fifteen human cases of ocular pentastomiasis have been described in the literature; however, this disease may be under-reported in rural areas of the tropics. Here, we review human cases as well as key aspects of the epidemiology, clinical features, treatment and prevention of this forgotten disease.
