Leishmania amazonensis is the etiological agent of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. The disease is extremely difficult to treat and frequently relapses once the treatment is interrupted. Although not yet approved in Brazil, miltefosine is an attractive alternative for leishmaniasis treatment due to its oral administration and low incidence of side effects. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of miltefosine against a L. amazonensis line that was isolated from a chronic diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis patient to ascertain whether miltefosine could be considered as a therapeutic option in this case. Parasites isolated from this patient were less susceptible to miltefosine than a reference strain in vitro. The mechanisms underlying this decreased susceptibility were studied in this natural parasite isolate in parallel with mutant strains selected in vitro for miltefosine resistance. A mutation in the gene encoding the miltefosine transporter was identified in the mutants selected in vitro but not in the line isolated from the patient. Notwithstanding the decreased susceptibility in vitro, when used to treat infected mice, miltefosine was equally effective against the isolate from the patient and the type strain, but completely ineffective against the resistant line.
