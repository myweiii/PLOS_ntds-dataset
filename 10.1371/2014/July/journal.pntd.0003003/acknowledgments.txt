We acknowledge the support of the Loreto Regional Health Department and the NAMRU-6 Febrile Surveillance Working Group [23]. We thank the technical staff for their efforts over the course of the study, including personnel who enrolled patients and collected samples at the study sites in Iquitos and personnel who performed the laboratory diagnostics in Iquitos and Lima. Development of the ideas presented here benefited from the Training Workshops on the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases, funded in part by the National Science Foundation (EF 0722115), and the Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program of the Science and Technology Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health.
