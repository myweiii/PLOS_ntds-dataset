Diarrheal diseases constitute a major health problem in Bangladesh, where Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are two most important causes of bacterial diarrhea. Prevention through vaccination is helpful to reduce the incidence and severity of diarrheal disease due to ETEC, particularly among children in low-resource settings. In this context, we collected stool and/or rectal swab (RS) specimens from patients with diarrhea between 2007 to 2012 under the 2% systematic routine surveillance system at the icddr,b hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh and screened for ETEC infection. We tested the specimens for two major virulence factors of ETEC: toxins and colonization factors. In this research article, we have focused on changes in toxin as well as colonization factor profiles of ETEC strains isolated from diarrheal patients seeking care at the icddr,b hospital between 2007–2012 and an earlier time period of 1996–1998. We concluded that, such shift in antigenic profile of ETEC over the study period is important in designing effective ETEC vaccines with broad protective coverage.
