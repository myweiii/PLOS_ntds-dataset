Urogenital schistosomiasis, caused by schistosome blood flukes, infects more than 100 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. Current control efforts involve regularly treating all school-aged children with the drug praziquantel, which kills schistosome worms. Earlier work by our group suggests that protective immunity against schistosomes is mainly stimulated by dying worms, and that in the short term, praziquantel treatment boosts immunity through killing worms. The longer-term impact upon the development of protective immunity is unknown. In this paper, we used a mathematical model which was able to replicate short-term patterns of infection and antibody to predict the long-term changes in antibody and infection levels that would occur during and after a 5-year treatment programme. We found that the longevity of protective immunity was particularly influential. Short-lived protective immunity was associated with levels of protective antibody declining below pre-treatment levels in the long term, and also with an increase in measured infection levels (eggs in urine) to peak above pre-treatment levels after the treatment programme finished. Antibody declines and infection peaks post-treatment were also predicted if treatment programmes reduced schistosome transmission. These results highlight the possible negative consequences of ceasing mass treatment programmes once they have commenced.
