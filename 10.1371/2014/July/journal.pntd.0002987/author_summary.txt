Infections with intestinal helminths and enteric bacterial pathogens such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) continue to be major global health problems, especially for children. The ability of the host to control bacterial enteropathogens may be influenced by host immune status and by concurrent infections. Helminth parasites are of particular interest in this context because of their ability to modulate host immune responses, and because their geographic distribution coincides with those parts of the world where infections caused by bacterial enteropathogens are most problematic. In this study, we determined how intestinal helminth infection regulates host innate immunity against bacterial enteropathogens by using a murine co-infection model. This model involves co-infection with the intestinal nematode parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus and the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, the murine equivalent of EPEC. The infections were carried out in wild-type mice and in mice lacking MyD88, a protein required for signaling by the Toll-like receptors. We found that co-infection with the helminth parasite significantly worsened Citrobacter-induced colitis in the MyD88-deficient mice, in association with increased mortality and compromised innate immune responses. Our observations demonstrate an important role for MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling in host survival during helminth and enteric bacterial co-infection.
