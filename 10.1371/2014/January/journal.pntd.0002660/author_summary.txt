This study provides the first ever recorded extraction of Mycobacterium ulcerans DNA from the environment in South America, specifically from French Guiana an ultra-peripheral French territory. M. ulcerans is the causative agent responsible for the devastating necrotic skin infection Buruli ulcer, which is prevalent in many tropical countries, notably in western and central Africa, and continues to present outbreaks in the developing world. Despite this, our understanding of the disease remains limited, routes of infection, environmental sources and ubiquity within the environment are still uncertain and only within the past decade have we begun to understand more about this emerging disease.
