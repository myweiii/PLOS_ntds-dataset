Amoebiasis is a disease caused by a protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, with or without clinical symptoms. Humans are the only relevant host of this parasite, which mainly targets the large intestine and the liver. The current drug, metronidazole, has been successfully used against this parasite for several years. However, some reports have shown either parasite resistance or adverse effects due to its long term usage. Our study thereby pointed to alternative treatment of this infection by investigating the rational use of Codiaeum variegatum also referred as “garden croton” which is a medicinal plant used in Cameroon against bloody diarrhoea. We moved into the identification of the most efficient fraction of the aqueous extract of this plant, and initiated the characterization of the mechanism of action of this fraction. Upon treatment with the active fraction, parasite death occurs within two days through morphological changes such as cell membrane disorganization and cell destruction. More deeply, we found that components of the active fraction modify expression of genes involved in ceramide biosynthesis, a pathway responsible for cell death and growth inhibition. Our study therefore suggests a novel finding which could be further explored for screening of anti-amoebic drugs.
