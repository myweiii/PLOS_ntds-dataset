E. multilocularis is a parasitic helminth causing the chronic human disease alveolar echinococcosis. Current disease control measures are very limited resulting in a high case-fatality rate. A transiently dominating Th1 immune response is mounted at the early phase of the infection, potentially limiting parasite proliferation and disease progression. Understanding the molecular basis of this early anti-Echinococcocus Th1 response would provide valuable information to improve disease control. The authors found that EmTIP, a T-cell immunomodulatory protein homologue, is secreted by the parasite early larva and promotes a Th1 response in host cells. Interestingly, EmTIP binding by antibodies impairs the development of the early parasite larva towards the chronic stage. Altogether the authors propose that E. multilocularis utilizes EmTIP for early larval development, but in the process, the factor is released by the parasite larva and influences host T-cells by directing a parasitocidal Th1 immune response. Therefore, the authors recommend EmTIP as a promising lead for future studies on the development of anti-Echinococcus intervention strategies.
