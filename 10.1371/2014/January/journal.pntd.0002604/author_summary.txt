Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infectious disease, characterized by deep, ulcerating skin lesions, particularly on arms and legs, which are provoked by a toxin. BU is caused by a microbe of the genus that also cause tuberculosis and leprosy. The 33 countries where Buruli ulcer has been detected, especially in West Africa, have mainly tropical and subtropical climates, although the disease is also present in temperate areas of Australia and Japan. There is no effective vaccine against BU and it is still not fully understood which immune defence mechanisms (antibodies and/or T cells) are needed to control the infection. The identification of microbial components that are involved in immune control is an essential step in the development of an effective vaccine. In this paper, we used an experimental mouse model to demonstrate the immunogenicity and the vaccine potential of enzymes involved in the toxin synthesis. Combinations with other vaccine candidates, such as a subunit vaccine against Ag85A targeting cell wall synthesis or with live, attenuated M. bovis BCG or mycolactone negative Mycobacterium ulcerans remain to be tested.
