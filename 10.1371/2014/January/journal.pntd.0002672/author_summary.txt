Leptospirosis is a globally widespread bacterial infection caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira. The disease manifestations of leptospirosis range from mild, non-specific illness to a severe disease that includes multi-organ failure, widespread damage to blood vessels, and hemorrhage. Attachment to human or animal cells is likely to be important to the ability of the bacteria to spread and to cause disease. In this study, members of the cadherin family were identified as mammalian cell receptors that bind Leptospira. Cadherins are cell surface proteins that function to maintain cell-cell integrity by anchoring neighboring cells together. Disease-causing L. interrogans, but not the non-infectious L. biflexa, binds to cells that line blood vessels and VE-cadherin, the predominant cadherin found in this cell type. The binding of bacteria was reduced in the presence of antibodies against VE-cadherin, supporting the role of this protein in bacterial attachment. The attachment of L. interrogans to the inner lining of the vessels via VE-cadherin may result in damage, facilitating the escape of the pathogen from the bloodstream into different tissues, and may contribute to the hemorrhagic manifestations of leptospirosis. This work is first to identify a mammalian cell surface protein as a receptor for L. interrogans.
