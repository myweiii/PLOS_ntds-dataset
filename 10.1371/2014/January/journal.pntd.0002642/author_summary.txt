We developed a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of typhoid in order to evaluate the potential direct and indirect (i.e. herd immunity) effects of vaccination. The model was fit to data from Vellore, India and validated against the results of cluster randomized vaccine trials. We evaluated a variety of school-based vaccination strategies and found that typhoid vaccination is expected to lead to short-term indirect protection and a decrease in typhoid incidence, but vaccination alone is unlikely to lead to elimination. The level of indirect protection was found to depend on assumptions about the role of chronic carriers, identifying an important area for future research.
