Soil-transmitted helminthiases are infections of public health importance in Honduras. Although research data on this topic in the country is somewhat inconsistent and scattered, a wealth of information has been produced by Honduran researchers and practitioners over the years. The vast majority of this information, however, remains inaccessible in the gray literature, thus missing its potential to inform research, policy, and practice. We undertook a thorough review of the literature produced from 1930 to 2012 in order to identify research gaps and, based on a select number of studies, conducted a prevalence analysis with data generated between 2001 and 2012. Our study reveals that these parasitic infections have not been a focus of sustained research efforts in Honduras. Literature analysis identified current knowledge gaps related to infection risk factors, disease burden, and anti-parasitic drug efficacy, among others. Evaluating and monitoring the national control program also emerged as a priority. Our study also reveals geographic areas of very high endemicity, suggesting that targeted interventions might be appropriate in localized areas of the country. Honduras is at present expanding the deworming program to include pre-school children and the data presented here could serve as a baseline for future monitoring and research.
