We would like to thank the team at the IRD for supporting this study, particularly Ms. Sandrine Dupe who was instrumental in formulating the questionnaire and assisted in all stages of the survey. Special thanks also go to the ARS and their team of coordinators, technicians, and agents. In particular, we would like to extend our gratitude to the coordinators, Thomas Margueron and Manuel Rodicq as well as the many technicians who helped in the implementation and organisation of the field-work. Finally, the study could not have been achieved without the dedication and patience shown by all the vector control officers who volunteered to conduct the interviews.
