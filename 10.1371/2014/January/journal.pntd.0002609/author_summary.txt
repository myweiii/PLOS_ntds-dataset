The French Ministry of Health has, for decades, dedicated numerous resources to control mosquito density on the Island of La Réunion. These efforts were strengthened following an outbreak of chikungunya, a virus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, in 2005–2006. In order to understand how public perception and behaviour is affected by this vector, a study was undertaken in 2012. Public behaviour was assessed using estimates of household expenditure on protective measures against mosquitoes. Information was gathered using a survey administered to 1024 households on the Island. Knowledge about mosquitoes was found to be poor across the sample, while perceptions of a risk from epidemics were high. The threat of a chikungunya epidemic was found to be associated with increased expenditure on protective measures, as was a zone-level measure of mosquito density, the Breateau Index. The most important finding is that overall household expenditure due to mosquitoes over a one-year period is USD 28.05 million, rather high when compared to the public service investment. Future vector-control in La Réunion needs to ensure that public health messages are understood by the population and that interventions are implemented that promote appropriate behaviours and reduce current spending at the household-level on protective measures.
