Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis is a sandfly-borne disease of humans and dogs caused by the intracellular parasite Leishmania infantum. Dogs are the proven reservoir. The disease is usually fatal unless treated, and is of global health significance. Diagnosis of canine infections relies on serum antibody-based tests that measure infection. In some endemic regions, a test-and-slaughter policy of seropositive dogs forms part of the national control policy to reduce human infection. However, this strategy is not considered effective. Since not all infected dogs are infectious to sandfly vectors, one option is to target control at infectious dogs, as only these dogs maintain transmission. We quantify Leishmania numbers in individual host tissues from time of infection using molecular methods. Comparing these results with their infectiousness to sandflies, we also evaluate the performance of molecular and immunological assays to identify infectious animals. Parasite numbers varied substantially between individuals, increasing with duration and severity of disease. Infectiousness to the sandfly vector was associated with high parasite numbers, and parasite loads in the skin was the best predictor of being infectious. The results suggest that molecular quantitation is useful in identifying individuals and populations responsible for maintaining transmission, with potential application in operational control programmes.
