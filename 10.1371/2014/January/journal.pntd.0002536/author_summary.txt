Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as Kala azar, accounts for the second-highest burden of parasitic disease worldwide. Fifty percent of VL cases worldwide occur in India, and up to 90% of these in the state of Bihar. Up to 10% of VL patients relapse within 6 months of treatment, particularly if co-infected with HIV. Limited data are available regarding relapse in patients with intact immune systems. Between 2007–2012, with support of the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute(RMRI), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) treated VL patients in Bihar with 20 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome). Here we identify risk factors for relapse in immunocompetent patients by comparing the demographics and clinical characteristics of 119 patients testing negative for HIV who experienced parasitologically-confirmed VL relapse against those of the remaining 8418 patients not known to have relapsed. Male sex, age <5 years and ≥45 years, shorter duration of symptoms prior to seeking treatment, and a smaller reduction in spleen size by time of discharge were all risk factors for relapse. The majority of relapses occurred 6–12 months post-treatment with Ambisome. The conventional period of follow-up is 6 months. Considering the aim of elimination in the Indian subcontinent, this data suggests that 1-year follow-up is necessary.
