We would like to dedicate this manuscript to the memory of Dr Durga Datt Joshi, who passed away on 25 November 2013. Dr Joshi was the pioneer researcher in the field of veterinary public health in Nepal. Long before the advent of DALYs, Dr Joshi realized the importance of zoonotic diseases, and significantly contributed to our current understanding of their epidemiology and impact.
