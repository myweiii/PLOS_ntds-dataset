Mycobacterium ulcerans causes skin disease predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and southeastern Australia. The mode of transmission and the environmental reservoir(s) of the bacterium are unknown. Investigations have detected M. ulcerans DNA in a variety of Australian environmental samples, including the faeces of native possums. This report expands on these studies by detailing the clinical, pathological and microbiological findings in affected wild possum species in endemic areas. Twenty-seven clinically and 12 subclinically affected individuals were identified. Most clinical cases were adults with skin ulcers of the face, limbs and/or tail. The disease was mild and self-limiting in both Trichosurus spp. possums. In contrast, many of the common ringtail possums had multiple skin ulcers and in some there was evidence of internal disease. There were also significant levels of M. ulcerans DNA throughout the gut. Comparisons were made with regards to disease category, species and sex; with clinical cases more likely to be male common ringtail possums. Asymptomatic gut carriage of M. ulcerans DNA is quite common and may be transient in some individuals. Further work is needed to determine whether M. ulcerans infection poses a potential threat to possum populations, and whether these animals are acting as reservoirs in some areas.
