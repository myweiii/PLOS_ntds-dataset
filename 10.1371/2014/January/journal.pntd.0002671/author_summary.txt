Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are a major health problem in developing countries, where they are still endemic. Accurate diagnosis remains a challenge, as identification of the causal agents, Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, respectively, requires appropriate facilities (for bacterial culture) and specific reagents (typing antisera). Several Salmonella serotype-specific PCR assays have been published and even used directly on biological samples, but none has been validated on a large collection of strains to check for reliability and robustness. We report here the successful development of conventional and real-time PCR assays for the identification of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates. These assays, based on an original target (CRISPR), had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% in tests on a collection of more than 330 strains. The conventional multiplex PCR assay provides an alternative to the serotyping method for laboratories in developing countries unable to obtain a regular supply of typing antisera but with access to PCR technology.
