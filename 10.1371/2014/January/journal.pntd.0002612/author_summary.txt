The oedematous form of Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is less common representing 7% of cases over a 15 year period in a patient cohort from the Bellarine Peninsula of south-eastern Victoria, Australia. In this study, for oedematous Buruli ulcer cases, fever and pain were usually present and investigations showed leucocytosis, neutrophilia and a raised serum CRP. This is in contrast to other forms of Buruli ulcer which are classically painless and not associated with systemic symptoms. As a result oedematous cases were usually misdiagnosed and treated as bacterial cellulitis leading to delays in diagnosis, progression of disease, increased morbidity and increased complexity of treatment. Compared with non-oedematous forms of Buruli ulcer, we found that oedematous lesions were strongly associated with being located on the dorsum of the hand, the elbow and the ankle, and with patients who had diabetes mellitus. This study aims to increase the awareness of odematous Buruli ulcer disease, and improve the understanding of its clinical presentation and risk factors, to aid clinicians to diagnose and treat early Mycobacterium ulcerans infection when managing patients with cellulitis who have been exposed to areas endemic for Buruli ulcer.
