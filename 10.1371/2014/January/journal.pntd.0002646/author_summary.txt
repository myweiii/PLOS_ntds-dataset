Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. Its clinical manifestations are widespread, ranging from ulcerative skin lesions to life-threatening visceral infections. Approximately 1.5â€“2 million new cases of leishmaniasis are reported each year with an estimated 70,000 deaths. During the infectious cycle, Leishmania differentiates from the extracellular promastigote to the intracellular pathogenic amastigote form. Differentiation is triggered by environmental signals within the mammalian host, namely acidic pH and high temperature. Due to the absence of vaccination, chemotherapy, together with vector control, remains one of the most important elements in the control of leishmaniasis. Current anti-leishmanial drugs include pentavalent antimony, amphotericin B and miltefosine; most are toxic, expensive and risk becoming ineffective due to emerging resistance. Therefore, new drugs are urgently needed. LmaPA2G4 is a homolog of human proliferation-associated 2G4 protein (PA2G4, also termed Ebp1). We show that it is an essential gene in L. major and a gain-of-function approach allowed us to implicate LmaPA2G4 in translation and subsequent protein synthesis reduction, growth defects and virulence attenuation. This work highlights the essential role of LmaPA2G4 in the biology of the parasite and thus makes it an attractive target for drug development.
