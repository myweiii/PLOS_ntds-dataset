Visceral leishmaniasis is a potentially fatal disease which affects 0.2–0.4 million people every year, principally in South-East Asia, Latin America or Eastern Africa. Currently the safest drug in use is AmBisome®, which cures 90% of patients in India at 5 mg/kg, and is even more effective at higher doses (10 mg/kg) or in combination with miltefosine or paromomycin. These regimens have been shown to be equally cost-effective in India. However, the drug requires a cold chain for storage and reconstitution prior to injection. Although it is licensed for use in eastern Africa, in practice it is mainly used as a second-line treatment. A small study carried out in Kenya indicated that a higher dose is necessary in eastern Africa in contrast to Asia. This study aimed to determine the minimum single dose that is safe and effective for treatment of eastern African VL patients so as to be used in simplified treatment regimens. However, the tested regimens were found to be ineffective, and an optimal single dose that could potentially be used in simplified treatment regimens was not identified.
