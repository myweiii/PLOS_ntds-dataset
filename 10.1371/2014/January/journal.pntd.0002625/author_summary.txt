Fish-borne zoonotic trematodes (FZT) including liver and small intestinal flukes in humans and domestic animals are a growing problem in Southeast Asia. WHO has recently recognized the problem, listed the liver flukes as neglected tropical diseases and recommends mass drug treatment of humans to overcome the diseases. Domestic animals including dogs, cats and pigs contribute to transmission and the infection must be controlled in these animals if the transmission cycle shall be broken. We studied the effect of a single praziquantel treatment in a group of natural infected dogs in an FZT endemic area in Northern Vietnam. The dogs were followed over 4 months after treatment and management practices were described. We found that dogs had easy access to raw fish and did not receive treatment against flukes by their owners. More than fifty per cent of the dogs became reinfected with FZT within 3 months after treatment. We conclude that repeated mass treatments are not applicable and cannot stand alone for control of FZT in dogs. The reinfection pattern in humans treated for FZT needs to be investigated to monitor effect of mass drug treatments and avoid development of drug resistance.
