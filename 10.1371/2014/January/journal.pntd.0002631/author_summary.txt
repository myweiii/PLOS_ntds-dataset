Giardia intestinalis causes one of the most common human intestinal diseases worldwide, called giardiasis. This microorganism infects the small intestine where it has to cope with O2, nitric oxide (NO) and related reactive species that are toxic for Giardia as it lacks most of the conventional antioxidant enzymes. Understanding how this pathogen survives oxidative stress is thus important because it may help to identify novel drug targets to combat giardiasis. Some enzymes playing a role in the antioxidant defense of Giardia have been recently reported, but it is yet unknown how the parasite copes with two well-known oxidants, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−). In this study, the Authors show that Giardia expresses two enzymes (called peroxiredoxins), yet uncharacterized, that are able not only to degrade both H2O2 and ONOO−, but also to repair damaged molecules (called hydroperoxides) that accumulate in the cell under oxidative stress conditions. These results are totally unprecedented because no enzymes with these types of functions have been reported for Giardia to date. If these two enzymes will prove to be essential for Giardia virulence in future studies, a new way will be paved towards the discovery of novel drugs to treat giardiasis.
