We wish to acknowledge cattle keepers in the 20 villages where this study was carried out for allowing us to use their cattle as study animals and spending their time to present them for treatments and blood sampling. We are greatly indebted to the Tororo District Veterinary officer (Dr.Tegule Mukonge) and the rest of his staff whose technical and community mobilization skills were central to the successful implementation of the field studies described in this manuscript. We also acknowledge the district Entomologist, Ms. Ann Asinde for helping with tsetse trapping and species identification. We would also like to acknowledge the input of Ward Bryssinckx (of Avia-GIS, Belgium) and that of Albert Mugenyi (of the Co-ordinating office for control of trypanosomiasis in Uganda) for improving our understanding of the use of ArcMap software in general mapping and spatial data analyses.
