Poverty, hunger and human ill-health aggravated by trypanosomiasis in Sub-Saharan Africa can only be reduced by developing and using cheap and effective tsetse control methods. To further reduce the cost of tsetse control by restricting insecticides to the legs, belly and ears (RAP) we set out to determine the lowest RAP coverage that can effectively control tsetse. Cattle in 20 south-eastern Uganda villages were randomly allocated to 5 treatment groups, ear-tagged for ease of follow-up and treated twice forty days apart with a trypanocide at the beginning of the trial. Cattle in regimens 2–4 received monthly graded RAP (25%, 50% and 75% of village herd respectively), while those in regimens 1 and 5 received no more treatment and deworming once every three months respectively. Molecular techniques were used to check for trypanosome infections, while tsetse apparent density was determined by traps at 161 locations in the district. About 25% RAP coverage was effective at controlling T. brucei s.l. while 50–75% RAP coverage would need to be used for effective T.vivax and T.congolense nagana control. Use of RAP at lower herd coverage is envisaged to reduce its cost, damage to the environment and improve its uptake in resource poor communities.
