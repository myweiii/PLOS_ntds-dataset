Plasmodium vivax is responsible for causing malaria in large parts of the globe, including regions with temperate climates not suited for the transmission of other Plasmodium species. In addition, P. vivax has the propensity to form dormant forms, known as hypnozoites, that can remain latent for weeks to months and reactive periodically to cause recurrent infections. Prevention of P. vivax malaria, more than any other form, will require a vaccine-based intervention due to limitations in treatment options. To this end, we tested the efficacy in non-human primates, of a vaccine based on circumsporozoite protein, a preerythrocytic stage antigen, of P. vivax. Aotus monkeys were immunized with clinical-grade antigen, combined with two immunomodulators, and then challenged with P. vivax sporozoites. Following challenge 66.7% of monkeys were protected. Analysis of serum samples indicated that protection was associated with antibodies to the central repeat region of the molecule, and that protection was lost upon waning of these antibodies. This is the first report demonstrating that active immunization with a recombinant protein can lead to complete protection in monkeys following sporozoite challenge, while also demonstrating a protective associate. Our data can help serve as a benchmark for down-selection of future vaccine formulations for P. vivax.
