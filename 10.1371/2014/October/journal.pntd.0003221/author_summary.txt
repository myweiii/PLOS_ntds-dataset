Schistosomiasis is a chronic and debilitating disease. Current control focuses primarily on mass drug administration (MDA). We monitored schistosome transmission via fecal egg counts and genetic markers in a school based MDA setting to learn how the intervention was influencing transmission or the targeted schistosome population. For 4 years, we followed 67 children enrolled in a MDA program in Kenya, and for 15 of these, we repeatedly acquired in depth genetic data regarding the schistosome populations they harbored. Although prevalence declined in the 67 children, we found no evidence of reduced egg counts/worm burdens in those that reacquired infections and genetic diversity of schistosomes increased over the course of treatment. Our data indicate that this school based MDA program had a strong benefit to individual health as fewer children were infected over time. However, this decline does not appear to be due to schistosome population reduction, and may be caused by either acquired resistance or behavioral changes of the children. In conclusion, control programs based on chemotherapy alone or based on only a subset of the population will need to be supplemented with additional approaches if we are to achieve the WHO goal of eliminating human schistosomiasis by 2025.
