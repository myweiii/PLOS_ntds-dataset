West Nile virus (WNV) emerged in North America in 1999 and rapidly spread across the U.S. due to the presence of highly susceptible mosquito vectors and avian hosts. One of the major avian reservoirs for WNV in the U.S. is the house sparrow (HOSP), which has low mortality during WNV infection. Here, we investigate how the response of wild HOSPs to WNV infection has changed as a result of the 15-year history of WNV circulation in the U.S. In addition, we evaluated the impact of WNV evolution on viral infection in HOSPs and report that WNV has become increasingly pathogenic to HOSPs over time, while HOSPs may have developed resistance to early WNV strains. Thus, HOSPs are still likely to be an important avian reservoir for WNV in the U.S., and WNV has adapted to its avian hosts during emergence in North America.
