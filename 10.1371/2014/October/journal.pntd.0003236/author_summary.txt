Co-infection of malaria and intestinal helminths causes significant and additive problems against the host. In order to contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology and control of concomitant intestinal geohelminthiasis and malaria infections in Cameroon, a cross-sectional study to assess its prevalence and evaluate its influence on malaria and anaemia was carried out in two rural communities (Nkassomo and Vian) of the Mfou health district. Fresh stool and finger prick blood samples from 263 participants aged 1â€“95 years were analysed to identify and quantify the geohelminths and malaria parasites respectively. Anaemia was assessed by measuring the haemoglobin levels. Whereas Plasmodium falciparum (77.2%) was the only malaria parasite species found in the study population, Ascaris lumbricoides (21.6%) and Trichuris trichiura (10.8%) were the only geohelminths detected. The prevalence of malaria and geohelminth co-infections was 22.1% with co-infections of A. lumbricoides and P. falciparum being the most frequently encountered and associating positively. The prevalence of anaemia was 42%, with the most affected being those with co-infections of T. trichiura and P. falciparum. Schoolchildren had significantly higher risk of geohelminthiasis, and their co-infection is a cause for concern and should strategically be considered in the designing and implementation of their control.
