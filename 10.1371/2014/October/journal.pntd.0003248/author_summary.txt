Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) are one of the most important neglected infectious diseases (NID). These not only have the potential to affect the growth and development of children, but can have irreversible consequences that carry into adulthood. However its prevalence has not been estimated since many years in Honduras. Although Honduras is the country with the highest burden of malaria in Central America, efforts to reduce the number of cases due to Plasmodium falciparum have lead the country towards an initiative for elimination. Using common platforms to do mapping of NID allows countries to reduce costs, build local capacities and strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems to track progress towards control and elimination goals. Honduras, one of the poorest countries in Central America, took advantage of an initiative to establish the prevalence of STH in school age children to assess the prevalence of malaria as a step in compiling evidence to support a future process of elimination of the disease. This innovative manner to put together epidemiological information for several NID might be replicated in other countries in the Americas to produce baseline and follow-up data to support decision making for processes to reach the goals established for these diseases.
