Paragonimiasis is a food-borne trematode infection that people acquire when they eat raw or undercooked crustaceans. Disease symptoms (including cough, fever, blood in sputum, etc.) can be similar to those observed in patients with tuberculosis or bacterial pneumonia, frequently resulting in misdiagnosis. Although the infection is relatively easy to treat, diagnosis is complicated. Available diagnostic assays rely on total parasite homogenate to facilitate the detection of Paragonimus-specific antibodies in patients. Though these blot-based assays have shown high sensitivity and specificity, they are inconvenient because total parasite homogenate is not readily available. This study used next generation genomic and proteomic methods to identify transcripts and proteins expressed in adult Paragonimus flukes. We then used sera from patients infected with P. kellicotti to isolate immunoreactive proteins, and these were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The annotated transcriptome and the associated proteome of the antibody immune response represent a significant advance in research on Paragonimus. This information will be a valuable resource for further research on Paragonimus and paragonimiasis. Thus this project illustrates the potential power of employing systems biology for translational research in parasitology.
