Plague is a vector-borne bacterial infection with rodents and their fleas as its principal hosts. Transmission to humans occurs via the bite of an infected flea. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague is endemic and more than one hundred human cases are reported every year. Global climate is known to affect many infectious diseases and has been shown to affect plague incidence in other areas of the world. The ENSO and the IOD are global climate drivers affecting rainfall and temperature in Madagascar. Our study investigates the effect of global climate drivers on human plague incidence on the island. We found a link between ENSO, IOD, temperature and precipitation and plague incidence throughout the 48-year time-series although it was not constant over time. The correlation between ENSO and plague turned from weakly positive to strongly negative and then to positive, and the association with the IOD became stronger with time. We demonstrate that during periods of high ENSO intensity, plague incidence is likely to increase via ENSO's impact on temperature and precipitation. This shows that climate indices can be a tool to help predict human plague incidence.
