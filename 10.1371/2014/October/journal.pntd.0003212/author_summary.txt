Sleeping sickness, or human African trypanosomosis, constitutes a serious health problem in sub-Sahara Africa. Treatment is a key factor in the control of this disease, not only to save the lives of the individual patients but also to stop transmission. As for other infectious diseases, drug resistance forms a constant threat for sleeping sickness control. Understanding the mechanisms underlying drug resistance is of uppermost importance for evidence-based adaptation of treatment protocols as well as for the development of new drugs. In this study we investigated the phenotype and genotype of more than 40 recently isolated strains of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the parasite that causes sleeping sickness in West and Central Africa. By comparing the parasites from cured and from relapsing patients in two separated sleeping sickness foci, we can explain the difference in treatment failure rates between these two sleeping sickness foci in D.R. Congo. We also provide evidence that treatment outcome in the individual patient is not exclusively defined by the drug resistance genotype of the infecting parasite but that other factors must be involved.
