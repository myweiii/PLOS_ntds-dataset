Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a serious medical and social problem in Latin America and is also a worldwide concern due to widespread immigration. The current treatment with benznidazole is effective in the acute phase of the disease but has several limitations and many side effects. We showed that ruthenium complex with benznidazole and nitric oxide (RuBzNO2) is very effective in killing the extracellular and intracellular forms of T. cruzi in vitro. In addition, low concentrations of this compound are able to substantially ameliorate the survival of infected mice by decreasing the amount of parasites in the heart and, consequently, reducing heart inflammation and lesions. Low concentrations of RuBzNO2 acted in a more effective manner than the same concentrations of benznidazole, indicating a synergistic effect due to NO and benznidazole. The substantial efficacy of treatment with benznidazole at a lower concentration than that used currently in clinical practice is very promising for avoiding the side effects that occur. Thus, our data provide a new potential candidate for the treatment of Chagas disease.
