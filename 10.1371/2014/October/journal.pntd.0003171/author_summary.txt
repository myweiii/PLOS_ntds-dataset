Dengue virus (DENV) infection occurs throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world where dengue is a major public health problem. Laboratory diagnosis of dengue with a single serum specimen obtained during the acute phase of the illness requires tests to detect IgM antibodies to DENV or the virus genome. A previous evaluation of available tests for IgM anti-DENV showed wide variability. The present study examined newly available commercial tests that detect the virus protein NS1, as well as new tests for IgM anti-DENV in microplate or rapid diagnostic test formats. This analytic study used specimens from laboratory confirmed dengue patients worldwide, which makes the results widely generalizable. The study found variability among the microplate ELISAs for both analytes but some tests performed with sensitivity and specificity acceptable for routine dengue diagnostics. The RDT's for both analytes had variable sensitivity that could be considered acceptable for routine clinical diagnostics. There is the need to maintain a network of dengue reference laboratories to conduct similar evaluations as additional dengue diagnostic tests become commercially available in order to guide the use for surveillance, clinical diagnosis and research.
