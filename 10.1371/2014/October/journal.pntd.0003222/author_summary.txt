Although sexually transmitted Entamoeba histolytica infection has been increasingly recognized among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Australia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, particularly those with HIV infection, no studies have examined E. histolytica infection in relation to HIV and attribution of sexual transmission at a national level. We analyzed the national surveillance data in Taiwan and demonstrated that the prevalent and incident HIV diagnoses increased among E. histolytica-infected adult males from 2006–2009 to 2010–2013, which were associated with previous syphilis and engagement of oral, anal, oral–anal sex. The findings indicate sexual transmission might have replaced traditional risk factors as the major route of E. histolytica transmission among adult males in Taiwan. E. histolytica infection associated with prevalent and incident HIV diagnoses preferentially affects younger urban MSM, suggesting new targets of surveillance and public health interventions for this sexually transmissible protozoan infection.
