Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease transmitted by the bite of a Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infected mosquito. Japanese encephalitis is an endemic disease in Taiwan. Before 2008, all known JEV isolates collected in Taiwan belonged to Genotype III of JEV. Genotype I JEV strains were first found in northern Taiwan in 2008. In this study, we conducted a survey of JEV in mosquitoes during 2005–2012. A total of 102,633 mosquitoes were collected from pig farms and wetlands. Among the 26 mosquito species collected, 11 tested JEV positive by RT-PCR, including Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. annulus and An. sinensis. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was the predominant vector species for transmission of JEV in Taiwan. The JEV infection rate of the mosquitoes captured on the pig farms was significantly higher than the rate of those captured in the wetlands, indicating that pigs played an important role in amplifying JEV. A phylogenetic analysis of the envelope gene sequences of JEV isolated from the mosquitoes demonstrated that the predominant JEV genotype shifted from genotype III to genotype I (GI), providing evidence for multiple introductions and transmission cycle maintenance of GI strains in Taiwan during 2008–2012.
