Dengue is caused by four different dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, -4). Infection induces long-term protection against the same serotype, but only short-term protection, and possible enhancement, from different serotypes. DENV neutralizing antibody titers (NTs) are thought to mediate protection or modify disease. Association of NTs with protection from infection has not, however, been clearly demonstrated. We analyzed data from two geographic clusters studies conducted in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, in which DENV NTs just before virus exposure were compared between DENV-infected “susceptible” and non-infected “non-susceptible” subjects. NTs appeared to be associated with protection against DENV-1, -2, and -4, but at different NT cutoff levels, with the cutoff for DENV-2 appearing to be the highest. These findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to investigate dengue epidemiology and develop dengue vaccine candidates.
