Infections by the mosquito-transmitted dengue virus continue to increase, threatening the health of people in over a hundred countries worldwide. The lack of effective mosquito control, licensed dengue vaccines or specific therapeutics to treat dengue infections presents challenges to reduce the burden of this disease. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of dengue infections is critical for the reduction of patients' morbidity and mortality. We present data that support the use of the InBios DENV Detect NS1 ELISA for the detection of dengue NS1 in patient serum. The InBios NS1 ELISA kit was tested against sera collected from acute fever patients seeking medical care in a Bangkok, Thailand hospital during 2010 and 2011. The data demonstrate the InBios DENV Detect NS1 ELISA accurately detects circulating dengue NS1 in the tested specimens, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of the NS1 ELISA kits was found to vary depending on the serological status of the patient (primary versus secondary dengue infection), time of specimen collection and dengue serotype. Further, the performance characteristics of the InBios DENV Detect NS1 ELISA were found to meet and exceed those of the commonly used Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag kit.
