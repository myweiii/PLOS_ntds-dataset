Eumycetoma is a severe chronic progressive fungal infection of skin and ultimately bone or viscera that affect mainly people with low economic status. Optimal treatment of this condition relies on medical and often surgical therapy and remains challenging because of lack of gold standard therapy and high rate of relapse after treatment discontinuation. In this retrospective study we assessed whether modern triazoles (voriconazole and posaconazole) suited to eumycetoma treatment and if tailored treatment duration, based on serial evaluation of a serum biomarker of fungal infection (Serum (1→3) ß-D-Glucan, (BD)), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (PET/CT) would be useful. We found that modern triazoles were efficient treatments of eumycetoma, allowing complete or partial response in 10/11 of patients, without significant side effects. Moreover, patients with treatment discontinuation based on normalization of BD, MRI or PET/CT seemed to have better long-term outcome than those with clinical cure but still abnormal BD or imaging results.
