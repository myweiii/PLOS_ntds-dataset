Hydroxymethylnitrofurazone (NFOH) is a promising drug candidate with demonstrated trypanocidal activity in experimental models of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and chronic disease development. In this study, we monitored the safety of NFOH in established in vitro and in vivo models. Our data show that NFOH did not induce hepatocyte cell death. Short-term or long-term treatment of mice with NFOH did not induce hepatic stress measured by cellular injury, inflammation or fibrosis. Benznidazole, the currently used treatment against acute infection in humans, was more toxic and induced chronic inflammation and liver injury in mice. We conclude that NFOH should be studied further to determine its potential safety for human use as an anti-parasite therapy.
