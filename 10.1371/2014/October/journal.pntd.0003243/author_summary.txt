Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a ubiquitous group of mycobacteria found in the environment. They are opportunistic pathogens causing human disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Differentiation between NTM infection and tuberculosis (TB) can be difficult. Data on incidence of NTM in TB endemic countries is limited due to resource intensive methods required for identification and a considerable workload due to other diseases. The present study was based on children investigated for TB and classified according to chest X-rays and mycobacterial culture reports. We explored host immune biomarkers which are potentially relevant to TB management, in children with confirmed NTM exposure. The findings from the present study suggest that NTM exposure modulates TB-relevant immune biomarkers in the host by eliciting some of the same immune responses as MTB infection. This is may be of importance when evaluating immunological correlates of protection in the setting of TB vaccine trials and potential TB diagnostic biomarkers.
