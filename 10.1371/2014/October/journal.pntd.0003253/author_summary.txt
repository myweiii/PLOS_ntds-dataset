Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, affects 10,000 patients annually, yet current drugs for this disease are poor, with high toxicity and inconvenient dosing requirements. Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that causes sleeping sickness, is sensitive to a class of compounds called kinase inhibitors, and our project was aimed at identifying kinase-targeting compounds that rapidly and irreversibly inhibit parasite growth. This was accomplished by high-throughput screening of over 42,000 compounds, which resulted in identification of 797 potent inhibitors of parasite growth that are non-toxic to human cells. These inhibitors were studied for the speed of their effects and reversibility of growth inhibition, and were grouped on the basis of chemical structure similarity. One compound was shown to cure mice from a bloodstream of infection of T. brucei. These compounds can now be utilized by the research community as starting points for new drug discovery, and also as tool compounds for understanding the function of kinases in T. brucei.
