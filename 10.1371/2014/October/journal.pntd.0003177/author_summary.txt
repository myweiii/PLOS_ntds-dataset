The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of dengue and yellow fever flaviviruses. Due to a lack of effective drugs or vaccines, if an epidemic of dengue fever occurs in the near future, the first line of defense will involve the use of insecticides to suppress adult populations of Ae. aegypti. Unfortunately, the species has become resistant to most of the insecticides that can be safely applied. The authors have worked extensively on the mechanisms of resistance to the various insecticides commonly used for suppression of Ae. aegypti populations. Temephos is an organophosphate insecticide used globally to suppress Ae. aegypti larval populations but resistance has evolved in many locations. In this study we show that temephos resistance is under the control of many metabolic genes of small effect and dispersed throughout the Ae. aegypti genome. This information will be of general interest to field workers involved in the suppression of field populations of Ae. aegypti.
