New drugs are needed to treat sleeping sickness, especially the second stage of the disease, which is characterised by the presence of parasites (trypanosomes) in the brain. The purpose of this work was to determine whether DB844, a new drug that is converted to the active form (DB820) after oral administration, has the potential to treat second stage sleeping sickness. Two dosing regimens of DB844 were evaluated in two groups of vervet monkeys that were infected experimentally with trypanosomes. Treatment was initiated four weeks after infection, when the monkeys were in second stage sleeping sickness, as confirmed by the presence of trypanosomes in brain fluid. Orally administered DB844 was well absorbed, tolerated and resulted in a decrease of trypanosomes in both the blood and brain fluid. However, some monkeys relapsed after treatment, with an overall cure rate of approximately 40% in both study groups. For at least two days after last dosing, the active drug, DB820, achieved blood concentrations known to be at least 19 times more than the minimum concentration that has been shown to be effective against a stringent human infective trypanosome isolate (STIB 900). These results represent an advance in efforts to develop new related compounds as oral treatments for sleeping sickness.
