Schistosomiasis, a chronic disease caused by agents of the genus Schistosoma, still afflicts more than 230 million people worldwide. The genomes of the three major pathogenic blood flukes, Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni, and Schistosoma haematobium, have been decoded as valuable entities for a systematic dissection of the biological characteristics of the parasites. Transposable elements constitute a major component in the genome of schistosomes and have been recognized as remnants of evolutionary events, but some of them are still active today. Thereby, the activity of these active mobile genetic elements should be restricted by elaborate mechanisms to protect genome stability. Our study showed that one of the three S. japonicum Argonaute proteins, SjAgo2, is involved in such mechanisms. By using specific mAb, native SjAgo2 protein was immunoisolated from a soluble adult worm antigen preparation, and its associated small RNAs were extracted for deep sequencing. We found that SjAgo2 is mainly associated with particular types of retrotransposon-derived siRNAs. For instance, siRNAs generated from 10 classes of well-defined retrotransposons were significantly enriched in the SjAgo2-specific libraries. Thus, a major function of Ago2 in S. japonicum is proposed to be the maintenance of genome stability via retrotransposon suppression. Our findings advance understanding of the putative gene regulatory mechanisms in a flatworm parasite.
