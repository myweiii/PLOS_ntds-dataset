Chagas disease is endemic in several Latin American countries and affects approximately 8 to 11 million people. The protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, is the agent of Chagas disease, a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted to humans by blood-sucking triatomine bugs. Other routes of infection include congenital transmission, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, accidental inoculation of the parasite during laboratory research and by consuming food and juice contaminated with the parasite. This study focused on the evaluation of three quantitative PCR (QPCR) assays for the diagnosis of Chagas disease. The evaluation was based on the analysis of 349 specimens submitted for confirmatory diagnosis of Chagas disease to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2008 to 2010. By using such assays we were able to diagnose acute and Chagas disease reactivation in 20 patients, including one case of organ-transmitted infection and one congenital case. The paper also highlights the benefit of extracting DNA from the blood specimen's buffy coat to increase the sensitivity of diagnostic PCR analysis. The results obtained in this study strongly indicate that at least two QPCR assays with different performance characteristics should be combined to increase diagnostic accuracy.
