BALB/c mice are highly susceptible while C57BL/6 is relatively resistant to experimental Trypanosoma congolense infection. Acute death observed in infected BALB/c mice is usually associated with the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases including those caused by parasites. However, the role of Tregs in the pathogenesis of T. congolense infection remains unclear. We were interested in addressing the following questions: Do Tregs contribute to the distinct phenotypic outcomes observed in T. congolense-infected BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice? If so, where and how do they operate with respect to parasitemia and cytokine response? By selectively altering the numbers of these cells either by targeted depletion with monoclonal antibody or adoptive transfer of highly enriched na√Øve CD25+ cells prior to infection, we show that Tregs impairs efficient parasite control and impacts on production of disease-exacerbating proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, our findings suggest that Tregs contribute to enhanced susceptibility to experimental T. congolense infection in mice.
