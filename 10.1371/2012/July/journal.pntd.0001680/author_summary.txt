In spite of the enormous prevalence of hookworm disease, just two drugs, albendazole and mebendazole, are most commonly employed for treatment and control, and both belong to the same benzimidazole chemical class. There exists, therefore, a pressing need to develop new, safe and inexpensive agents for the treatment of human nematode infections of global significance. We report the discovery of the striking efficacy of the cysteine protease inhibitor, K11777, against hookworms both in vitro and in vivo and discuss the development of this class of compounds as novel anthelmintics for the clinical management of hookworm disease. K11777 is chemically distinct from all the current anthelmintics and, therefore, not likely to share resistance characteristics. We describe mechanism of action studies that demonstrate that cysteine protease activity in parasites recovered after in vivo treatment with K11777 is almost completely (>95%) abrogated. Lastly, we report that K11777 provides near cure (>90%) of hookworm infection in a single oral administration (complete cure when given twice in one day). These results suggest that K11777 is on target to meet the current clinical practice and the logistics demanded for mass drug delivery of anthelmintics to humans (i.e., oral, single-dose treatment).
