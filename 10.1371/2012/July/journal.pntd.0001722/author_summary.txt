Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas disease, is responsible for high levels of mortality and morbidity in many countries of Latin America. This species is very polymorphic and was recently classified into six discrete typing units (TcI-VI) that are associated with different geographical distribution, transmission cycles, and varying disease symptoms. Natural parasite populations are thought to have a complex structure since in endemic areas the same hosts may be simultaneously infected by different T. cruzi strains due to frequent exposure to insects as well as the variety of reservoirs and vectors in the sylvatic environment and the heterogeneous composition of the parasite populations. Most of the putative multiclonal populations have been suggested based on indirect evidence, or current conventional cloning methods that may favor some individuals' growth. In an effort to elucidate the complexity of T. cruzi isolates we adapted a methodology originally described for analyzing single spermatozoids, to sort single parasites. This approach allowed us to completely dissect the complexity of four strains and estimate the relative contribution of each subpopulation. Knowledge about complexity of T. cruzi strains is essential for determining the aspects involved in differential parasite tissue tropism, clinical manifestations of the disease, and drug resistance.
