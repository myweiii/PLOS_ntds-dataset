There is an urgent need to field test dengue vaccine. Efficacy trials need to be conducted in study sites with
sufficiently high dengue incidence to make a robust estimate of vaccine efficacy and where all dengue virustypes
circulate frequently. In this paper, we report on dengue disease surveillance on approximately 3000 primary-school children in seven schools in Muang district of Ratchaburi province, central Thailand, from 2006 through 2009. We report on the characteristics of children in this cohort who fell ill with laboratory confirmed dengue disease. The study showed that approximately four percent of the children had laboratory confirmed dengue per year. All four dengue virus types were found to be the causes of illness in children in all seven schools. This study has shown Muang district of Ratchaburi province to be suitable for dengue vaccine testing and the site has been selected for the world’s first dengue vaccine safety and efficacy study, being conducted from 2009–2014 in children aged 4–11 years.
