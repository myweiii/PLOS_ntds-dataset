Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that threatens nearly half the global population. The symptoms of this disease, caused by four closely related Dengue viruses, range from mild fever to potentially fatal haemorrhagic fever and shock. There is neither a preventive vaccine nor an effective antiviral therapy against the disease. The difference between severe and mild disease appears to be dependent on the viral load. Reducing the virus levels in the bloodstream through therapeutic intervention may be associated with favourable prognosis. We investigated the feasibility of destroying dengue virus genomic RNA using a phenomenon known as RNA interference, in which the RNA-cleaving activity of a cellular enzyme complex is directed to a site in the target RNA, using a short complementary RNA known as small interfering RNA. We used adenovirus, a common cold virus, to deliver a small interfering RNA complementary to a conserved region just adjacent to the initiator codon in the dengue virus RNA. We found that this could inhibit viral RNA multiplication, expression of viral proteins and the secretion of infectious virus. Importantly, our results showed that the adenovirus delivered small interfering RNA which could inhibit all four types of dengue viruses.
