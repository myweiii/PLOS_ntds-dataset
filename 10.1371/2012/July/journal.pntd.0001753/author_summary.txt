Soil-transmitted helminths (intestinal worms) are among the most common childhood infections worldwide and are a significant cause of morbidity particularly among poor populations living in developing countries. The potent immune modulatory effects of these parasites have been suggested to be a determinant of the epidemiological distributions of other infectious diseases (e.g., HIV and tuberculosis) and allergy. There is strong epidemiological evidence that some individuals have an increased susceptibility to re-infection after treatment and the mechanisms underlying this are not well understood. A possible explanation is that in utero exposure to maternal STH infections may increase the risk of infection during childhood, but, as far as we are aware, no published study has addressed this hypothesis for STH infections in humans. In this study, we evaluated whether children of mothers infected with STH infections have a greater risk of infection when compared to children of uninfected mothers. We also examined whether this increased susceptibility to infection might occur through the tolerogenic effects of increased levels in the systemic circulation of the immune regulatory cytokine IL-10, in early life. Our data provide evidence that maternal STH infections predispose children to infections with STH parasites, and this effect was associated with elevated levels of IL-10 in newborn blood.
