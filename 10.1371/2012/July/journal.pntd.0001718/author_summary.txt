Trichiasis is a potentially blinding consequence of trachoma. The World Health Organization has promoted the bilamellar tarsal rotation (BLTR) procedure as a treatment for trichiasis from trachoma. Even if trachoma were to be eradicated today, a great number of individuals would still develop trichiasis and lose vision unless they received surgical treatment. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate after BLTR can be quite high, and surgical factors are thought to contribute to unfavorable outcomes. In this study we evaluated the relationship between immediate post-operative contour and 6-week outcomes utilizing immediate post-operative photos of 200 trichiasis surgeries. We found good agreement between the predicted and actual outcome. The analysis allowed the identification of immediate post-operative eyelid contours that were most likely to lead to successful surgery at 6 weeks, as well as contours that resulted in adverse outcomes. The description of the target degree of rotation and how to adjust the rotating sutures to best achieve this ideal should help surgeons worldwide improve their surgical technique and outcomes.
