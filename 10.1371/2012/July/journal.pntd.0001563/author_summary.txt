Australian Aborigines experience streptococcal invasive diseases at a five times greater rate than the general Australian population [1], contributing to an estimated life expectancy gap of currently 13 years [2] with infectious diseases being the major cause in remote areas. Alternative approaches to control skin infection and associated complications in Aboriginal communities are imperative [3]. A clear link between scabies and bacterial pyoderma has been recognised as an underlying factor of Aboriginal cases of rheumatic fever and heart disease (RF/RHD), skin sepsis and renal disease [4]. Aiming to elucidate the causal molecular mechanisms we identified multiple scabies intestinal protein families functioning as inhibitors of human complement pathways, thereby preventing complement-mediated gut damage. The work presented here is at the forefront of a new agenda, looking at the interactions between scabies mites, bacteria and the host. We show that scabies mite proteins act as complement inhibitors and enhance GAS growth in whole blood assays, presumably by inhibition of host innate immunity. Based on this groundwork data we hypothesize that the complement-inhibitory functions of excreted gut molecules promote the growth of bacterial pathogens in the microenvironment of the epidermal burrows.
