Androctonus australis hector (Aah) is the scorpion most frequently causing serious human envenomation. In Algeria, Aah is responsible for approximately 50,000 cases of scorpion envenomation per year. The Aah sting causes multi-system failure that may be fatal; the manifestations include cardiopulmonary abnormalities, lung edema and inflammation. In addition, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia have been described in scorpion-envenomed animals. The mechanisms causing systemic and local inflammation are poorly understood. Here, we report that Aah venom causes pronounced upregulation of TNF-α, IL1-β and IL-6 expression in the adipose tissue, exacerbating inflammation. As the inflammatory state intensifies, 24 hours after envenomation, TNF-α and other factors are upregulated, and Map4k4 expression increases, blunting the insulin response in adipocytes by decreasing Hexokinase 2 expression. Administration of TNF-α inhibitor following the envenomation reduces Map4k4 expression and restores glucose uptake in adipose tissue. These findings provide coherent evidence linking Aah venom-induced adipose tissue inflammation to insulin resistance. The value of TNF-α inhibitors as a treatment complementary to anti-scorpion venom immunotherapy should be evaluated clinically.
