The authors thank all the study participants, the laboratory technicians for stool specimen analysis and Phousavanh Sisouphon and Lay Sisavath for laboratory quality control.

The authors also acknowledge Prof. Bruno Betschart from the University of Neuchâtel for his inestimable support, without which this publication would not have been possible.
