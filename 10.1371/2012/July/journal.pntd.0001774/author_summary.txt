Schistosomiasis or bilharzia is caused by infection with the trematode Schistosoma spp. It is widely prevalent in Mali, causing a major public health problem. One of the major control measures is mass treatment of population at risk, particularly school-age children, using the drug praziquantel. Mali started such mass drug treatments in 2005 and a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2010 in highly endemic region Segou to evaluate the impact of the programme comparing with the baseline data collected in 2004. The repeated treatment significantly reduced the intensity of infection which is closely related to the morbidity of schistosomiasis, however, the prevalence persists with little reduction in the highly endemic region. The results suggest that more intensified control measures be implemented in order to achieve the goal of schistosomiasis elimination, possibly more frequent treatments, improved coverage and improved water and sanitation.
