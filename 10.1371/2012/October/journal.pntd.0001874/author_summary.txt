Visceral leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection that results in death in susceptible people unless they are treated. Current drugs are expensive and toxic, and there are no vaccines in use in humans. We know that it is possible to become immune to infection with this parasite because people who have been cured using drug treatment are resistant to further infection. In addition, a large percentage of people infected with the parasite remain asymptomatic and develop a specific immune response that can be measured using crude leishmanial antigens. We hypothesized that these resistant people might hold the key to understanding the kind of immune response required for protection. In this paper we compared the immune response to a series of novel vaccine candidates in people with active disease, in those drug-cured from the disease, and in the naturally resistant individuals. We show that immune individuals make strong cytokine responses to five of eleven novel vaccine candidates that were tested, making them ideal candidates to take forward in the development of a defined vaccine against leishmaniasis.
