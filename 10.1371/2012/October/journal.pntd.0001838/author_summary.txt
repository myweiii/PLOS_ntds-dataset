Leprosy is one of the oldest human infectious diseases, which remains a public health problem with more than 200,000 new cases every year worldwide. Since the late 1990s, multi-drug resistant leprosy, resistant to rifampicin and dapsone, has emerged and the importance of ofloxacin has increased. However, their use for leprosy and other infectious diseases has already elicited ofloxacin resistant leprosy cases. Hence, early detection of ofloxacin resistance is essential for proper treatment. This study, by utilizing recombinant technology, predicted the future emergence of ofloxacin resistant Mycobacterium leprae with mutations that have not yet been reported. The data are useful for predicting ofloxacin resistance and, hence, able to contribute to the proper treatment of leprosy through suggesting the importance of analyzing gene mutations for FQ susceptibility testing.
