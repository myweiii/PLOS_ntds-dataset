Neurocysticercosis (NC), an infection of the central nervous system with Taenia solium metacestode (TsM), constitutes a leading cause of adult-onset seizures in endemic areas. Like other helminths, TsM is incapable of synthesizing lipid molecules. It should be equipped with a specialized system for lipid transportation from the host to ensure its long-survival. Such a transport system may be a target for function-associated drug design. We characterized two novel fatty-acid (FA)-binding TsM proteins (TsMFABP1 and TsMFABP2). Native and recombinant proteins bound to several FA analogs and retinol at micromolar and millimolar concentrations. Their binding was specifically inhibited by oleic acid. TsMFABP1exhibited high affinity toward FA analogs, while TsMFABP2 showed preferential affinity to retinol. Both TsMFABPs were predominantly expressed in the canal region of the worm, where lipids and retinol were abundantly distributed. The two paralogous TsMFABPs have undergone (or are still undergoing) structural diversification and following functional divergence to act as FABP or retinol binding protein, similar to the intracellular lipid binding proteins of deuterostomian animals. The canal region specific distribution of lipids, retinol and FABPs further suggested that cells in this area might differentiate into diverse cells to compose huge numbers of the proglottids, thereby playing vital roles in the parasite growth and development.
