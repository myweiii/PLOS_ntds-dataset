House Sparrows experimentally infected with West Nile virus [WNV] were necropsied at multiple time points from 3 to 18 weeks post infection (pi). The percent of birds with tissues positive for WNV RNA decreased from 100% at 3 wks to 13% at 18 wks pi; infectious virus was recovered from some birds by tissue co-cultivation and Vero cell passage from 3 to 12 wks pi, even though positive birds retained neutralizing antibody. WNV RNA also was detected in sera at 2 to 7 wks pi. Collectively, these data indicated that House Sparrows frequently developed persistent infections and could serve as an overwintering mechanism for WNV. However, recrudescent viremias suitable to infect mosquitoes have yet to be demonstrated and would seem to require host Immunosuppression.
