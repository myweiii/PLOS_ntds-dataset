Even though agrochemistry and infectious disease control have the same principle goal – the suppression of harmful      organisms without harming human health and the environment – there have been only very limited activities to exploit this overlap for the development of new antiinfectious drugs so far. In this study and for the first time, over 600 commercial agrochemicals were systematically screened against the infectious pathogens causing malaria, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. Many  highly active compounds with known low mammalian toxicity were identified in cell based assays, and the activity of some of them could even be confirmed in first animal model studies. Further expansion of this concept to other pathogens and the examination of analogues of the identified hits, potentially available from agrochemical companies, would allow for a very efficient source of novel drug candidates.
