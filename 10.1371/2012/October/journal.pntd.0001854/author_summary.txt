Parasitic nematodes infect over one billion people worldwide and cause many diseases, including strongyloidiasis,         filariasis, and hookworm disease. For many of these parasites, including Strongyloides stercoralis, the infectious form is a developmentally arrested and long-lived thirdstage larva (L3i). Upon encountering a host, L3i quickly resume development and mature into parasitic adults. In the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a similar developmentally arrested third-stage larva, known as the dauer, is regulated by four key cellular mechanisms. We hypothesized that similar cellular mechanisms control L3i arrest and activation. Therefore, we used deep-sequencing technology to characterize the S. stercoralis transcriptome (RNAseq), which allowed us to identify S. stercoralis homologs of components of these four mechanisms and examine their temporal regulation. We found similar temporal regulation between S. stercoralis and C. elegans for components of two mechanisms, but dissimilar temporal regulation for two others, suggesting conserved as well as novel modes of developmental regulation for L3i. Understanding L3i development may lead to novel control strategies as well as new treatments for strongyloidiasis and other diseases caused by parasitic nematodes.
