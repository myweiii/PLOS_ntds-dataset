Globalization of Chagas disease, from Latin America toward non endemic countries, has become a world health problem. In endemic countries, acute cases of Chagas disease transmitted by oral Trypanosoma cruzi infection, have been frequently reported in recent years. The diverse clinical manifestations of the disease are mainly attributed to the highly complex population structure of the parasite. We aimed in this study to investigate the impact of T. cruzi microdiversity in oral infection, by comparative analysis of Y30 and Y82 strains, both derived from Y strain, a widely used experimental model. Network phylogenies were inferred to determine their haplotype distribution and classification. Y30 and Y82 were closely related to Discrete Typing Unit TcII and TcVI, respectively. Y82, expressing the surface molecule gp82, was more efficient than Y30, expressing a related gp30 molecule, in establishing infection in mice by oral route. Both molecules are involved in host cell invasion, but exhibit differential gastric mucin-binding capacity, which is critical for parasite migration toward the gastric mucosal epithelium. The number of Y30 and Y82 parasites in gastric epithelial cells differed widely. Our results indicate that gp82-expressing strains are better adapted than gp30-expressing to traverse the stomach mucous layer and establish oral route infection.
