Rising prevalence of cholera outbreaks highlights the need for accurate detection tools. Diagnosing cholera early at the onset of an epidemic, at field level, should allow for a more timely response and a quick containment of the spread and thus a diminished case load. Currently the gold standard to identify the bacteria, Vibrio cholerae, from patient samples remains reliant on lengthy bacterial cultures and an array of biochemical tests. Furthermore, the need for highly-skilled operators and numerous laboratory resources underline the inadequacy of sophisticated tests for use in remote locations. Research to develop more appropriate tools has largely focused on rapid diagnostic tests and attempts to simplify existing technologies. This is yet to deliver evidence-based appropriate tools to address the burden-of-disease cholera inflicts. In light of this neglect we have taken the first step, assessing developments in commercialised diagnostic tools, reviewing previous evaluations undertaken in the literature since 1990. In doing so, we highlight evaluation study parameters that could benefit from stringent standardisation, and identify five tests that show promise for use in field conditions. The authors recommend an indipendent assessment of these products, including technical improvements as required and production to trigger early detection of cholera epidemics.
