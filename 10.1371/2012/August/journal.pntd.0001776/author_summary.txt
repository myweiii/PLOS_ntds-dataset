Giardia duodenalis is an important cause of diarrhoea in humans worldwide, even if the burden of infection is higher in developing countries where the poor sanitary conditions favour the contamination of water and food with infective cysts. The parasite is considered as a species complex that comprises at least eight distinct genetic groups, referred to as assemblage A to H. Humans are infected only by assemblages A and B, which can only be distinguished by molecular methods. The clinical manifestations of giardiasis in humans are highly variable and range from the absence of symptoms to acute or chronic diarrhoea. Since genetic traits that influence the virulence are yet unknown, the identification of the assemblage is considered a primary element in the study of human giardiasis. Current methods are time consuming and/or require expensive instruments. Here, we describe the development and application of single step PCR methods that allow to detect and distinguish assemblages A and B from human fecal specimens simply by gel electrophoresis of the amplification products. The novelty of the assays described in our manuscript is the reliability in detecting mixed infections and the applicability of the methodology in laboratories with basic molecular equipment.
