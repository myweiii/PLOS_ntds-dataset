Human toxocariasis is an infection caused by the larval stage of the worms Toxocara canis and less frequently Toxocara cati, common parasites of domestic and peridomestic dogs and cats. It is a cosmopolitan infection, occurring whenever the man-soil-dog relationship is particularly close, especially in tropical countries, where the humid climate favours the survival of parasite eggs in the soil, and in rural settings, where the poor hygiene increases the probability of human infection. Epilepsy affects nowadays at least 65 million of people worldwide and is particularly common in tropical areas, probably because of the presence of cases caused by infectious diseases largely absent in industrialized countries. For several decades, researchers have investigated the possible association between toxocariasis and epilepsy. In this study we conducted a statistical analysis of all the data available on the relationship between these two conditions. The combined results of the 7 studies included indicate an association between the two diseases. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate a causal relationship (i.e. toxocariasis causes epilepsy). Considering that toxocariasis is a preventable and common disease, a better understanding of the relationship between toxocariasis and epilepsy may contribute to improving prevention of epilepsy worldwide.
