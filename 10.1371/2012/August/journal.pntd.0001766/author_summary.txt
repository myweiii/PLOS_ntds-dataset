Trachoma is the commonest infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It causes trichiasis (inturning of the eyelashes to touch the eye), which can cause visual loss. Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) affects over eight million people, of whom 1.2 million live in Ethiopia â€“ the most affected country worldwide. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for TT. Despite the provision of free surgery in many areas, attendance rates are frequently low. An understanding of these barriers is fundamental for instituting measures to increase surgical uptake. In this study we interviewed 2591 people with TT in Ethiopia about their reasons for not having previously attended for surgery. The major barriers to attendance were lack of time, financial constraints and lack of an escort. TT is more prevalent in women and the elderly. Some barriers were particularly frequent in these high risk groups: lack of escort, fear of surgery and not knowing the surgical location impeded women more frequently than men, while financial constraints, transport difficulties and lack of escort affected more of those aged over fifty years than younger participants. It is likely that providing surgery closer to the patients would lessen many of these barriers.
