The factors explaining Rift Valley fever (RVF) spread in domestic livestock during an epidemic are attributed to short and long distance mechanisms, including active vector dispersal, passive vector dispersal and movements of infectious animals. However, because of data scarcity, quantifying and disentangling these mechanisms remains challenging. Here, we generate hypotheses on the possible mechanisms involved in RVF spread in South Africa between 2008 and 2011. We use descriptive statistics and estimate the space-time K-function to explore the presence of space-time interactions, being interpreted as an indicator of an underlying transmission process. Our results confirm the presence of an intense, short, initial transmission process that could be attributed to active vector dispersal; but also highlight the presence of another transmission mechanism of a lower intensity and over further distances that could be explained by the  movements of infectious animals, passive vector dispersal or emergence of other foci. Further data collection and modelling tools are required to confirm these hypotheses.
