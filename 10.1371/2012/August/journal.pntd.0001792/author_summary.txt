Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen that causes dengue-like syndromes. Despite its high epidemic potential, little is known about the virus. Although the isolation of the virus was confined to the African continent, serological evidences have shown the widespread distribution of ZIKV, particularly in Asia. In 2007, it caused a major outbreak on the Pacific Island of Yap, infecting more than 70% of the islandâ€™s inhabitants. The propensity of the virus to spread outside its known geographical range was again demonstrated when it was detected in the US from travellers coming back from endemic countries. Several species of Aedes spp. mosquitoes have been incriminated as vectors of ZIKV, including Ae. aegypti. The current study showed that local Ae. aegypti are highly susceptible to ZIKV and by day 5 post-infectious blood meal, more than 50% of mosquitoes were potentially infective. Singapore being a tourist and a business hub, coupled with the presence of susceptible vector and a population that is immunologically naive and vulnerable, the local transmission of the ZIKV is plausible. Nevertheless, Singapore's current dengue control strategy is applicable to control ZIKV.
