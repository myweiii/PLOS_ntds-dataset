Schistosomiasis remains to be a public health problem in 76 endemic countries in spite of control efforts that have        been done. Among the major causative agents of schistosomiasis, only Schistosoma japonicum is known to be zoonotic. However, the role of animal reservoir hosts has not been given much importance which might be the main hindrance in the possible elimination of the disease. In addition, animal surveillance is not part of the current schistosomiasis control program in most of the endemic countries. This study reports the use of recombinant proteins in ELISA for detecting the infection in water buffaloes. These antigens were previously used against humans and showed that SjTPx-1 and Sj7TR can be a good diagnostic antigen. Using the stool PCR as the standard test, SjTPx-1 and Sj1TR were shown to work on the water buffaloes better than the conventional SEA. These antigens can both be useful in the development of intensified animal surveillance for schistosomiasis.
