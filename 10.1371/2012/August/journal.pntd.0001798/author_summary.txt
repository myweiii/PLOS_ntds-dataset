The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with a variety of outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to fatal infection. In the last decade, an increasing number of VL cases in immunocompromised conditions have been reported. Loss of the control of parasite persistence causes relapse of the disease in these patients. To clarify why parasite persistence and disease are caused in an immunocompromised condition, we examined L. donovani infection in alymphoplastic aly/aly mice that completely lack lymph nodes and have disturbed spleen architecture. Although parasites grew in the liver of aly/+ mice for the first 4 weeks post infection (WPI) and parasites were eliminated by 8 WPI, we found that parasites persisted in the liver of aly/aly mice with the ineffective of granuloma formation to kill the parasites. These aly/aly mice showed significant increases in CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in the liver. Consequently, we treated infected mice with anti-CD25 or anti-FR4 mAb to inhibit the function of Tregs, and found significant reductions in both hepatic Foxp3+ cells and parasite burden. These results clearly demonstrated for the first time that the expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs is involved in hepatic L. donovani persistence in immunodeficient murine model.
