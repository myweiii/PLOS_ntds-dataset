Systemic leishmaniasis is known to have in general two types of clinical presentations. The classical form is a full fledged disease characterized by fever, severe weight loss, enlargement of lymph organs and anemia. It renders patients very sick and is sometimes fatal. The second form, known as sub-clinical leishmaniasis, is a milder disorder. Although it presents with symptoms analogous to the ones classically associated with this infection, they are far less severe and certainly fewer in number. In this report, we are describing a third type of presentation, which is distinct from the above described. The hallmark of this third type of clinical form is depressed immunity. A number of patients suffering from repeated infections affecting various body organs and systems (skin, respiratory, and alimentary) were referred to us for advanced immune function testing. We were able to identify in a fraction of these patients Leishmania parasites. Upon appropriate treatment, these patients recovered. Systemic leishmaniasis was thus the culprit of their repeated episodes of falling ill. Hence our recommendation in this report is to consider the diagnosis of systemic leishmaniasis in patients suffering from signs and symptoms indicating depressed immunity (repeated episodes of fever or infections).
