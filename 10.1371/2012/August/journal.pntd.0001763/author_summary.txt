Leishmania are obligated intracellular pathogens that develop almost exclusively in macrophages. Experimental leishmaniasis in mice is one of the most extensively studied models of intracellular infections both at the level of the parasite and host immune responses. We took advantage of Balb/c mice model to investigate gene expression profile through Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. In order to have a general and dynamic picture of the complex biological events that are acting in the context of Leishmania intracellular  parasitism, we investigated the mouse macrophage response to initial invasion of L. major over a time course that extended from one to 24 hours post-infection. Our results reveal the alteration of several biological processes and metabolic changes. Indeed, similarly to different other pathogens, Leishmania induces cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation that have been confirmed by confocal microscopy experiments. Whether Leishmania parasites take advantage of this high-energy source is now under investigation. Our findings provided further understandings in host responses to Leishmania infection.
