The parasite Trichomonas vaginalis infects in excess of 100 million people per year, and is a contributory factor to enhanced transmission rates of HIV, the causative virus in AIDS. As such, T. vaginalis infection is an important public health concern. Understanding the biology of the organism is important to determine aspects of the response to drug treatment, host:parasite interactions and so on. We have investigated an important family of proteins – the ATP binding cassette transporters – which are present in the membranes of all cells, and which contribute to a diverse spectrum of important cellular processes. The ABC transporters of T. vaginalis were identified by analysis of primary amino acid sequence data, and examined by subsequent protein and gene expression studies. Our most important conclusion is that – uniquely amongst eukaryotes - T. vaginalis has no ABC transporters capable of acting as monomers. In other words, its ABC transporters must all act by forming functional complexes with other ABC proteins. This has implications for our understanding not just of the parasite's biology, but also its evolution. In summary our analysis opens up the path for future research of individual members of the ABC protein family in T. vaginalis.
