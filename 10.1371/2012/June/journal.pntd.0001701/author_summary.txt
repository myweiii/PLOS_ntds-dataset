Driving resistance genes into vector populations remains a promising but underused method for reducing transmission of vector-borne diseases. Understanding the genetic mechanisms governing resistance and how resistance is maintained in vector populations is essential for the development of resistant vectors as a means of eradicating vector-borne diseases. We investigated the utility of one gene (cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase - sod1) for driving resistance associated alleles into populations of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata, a vector of the trematode parasite of humans, Schistosoma mansoni. Under controlled laboratory conditions we found no evidence for costs of resistance associated with carrying the most resistant allele at sod1 (in terms of growth, fecundity, or mortality). However, we did find a strong effect of genetic background on how strongly sod1 genotype influences resistance. Thus, epistatic interactions with other loci may be as important a consideration as costs of resistance in the use of sod1 for vector manipulation in the field.
