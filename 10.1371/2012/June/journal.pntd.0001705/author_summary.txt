Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is commonly confounded with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and it is unknown to many health professionals. It is endemic in many countries and there is no effective treatment available. Although a few individuals have severe symptoms, most patients remain asymptomatic throughout their lives. Further, HTLV-1 is considered a neglected public health problem and limited studies cover specific patients' needs and emotional experiences. To better understand how women and men living with HTLV-1 experience the disease and what issues exist in their healthcare processes, we conducted a qualitative study of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at an outpatient clinic at the Emílio Ribas Infectious Diseases Institute in São Paulo, Brazil. We found that the main focus of health staff was on illness risk, but not identifying infected relatives and preventing new infections. This point of view, ultimately neglected patients' complex demands, and overshadows the prevention of new infections and contributes to the lack of care in public health for HTLV-1 infected subjects. Furthermore, this perpetuates the infection among these populations and the patients experience an “invisibility” of their specific needs, such as reproductive rights and feel that their rights as citizens are ignored.
