The dog is the principle reservoir of Leishmania infantum, a parasite spread from dog to dog by a sandfly vector. The reduction of canine leishmaniasis is therefore a key factor in the overall management of the epidemiology of this parasite. There is also a need for effective prevention on welfare grounds because of the clinical severity of this potentially fatal disease in dogs. The key factor determining the outcome of infection in dogs is the ability to mount a Th1-dominated immune response, because this is more effective against intracellular pathogens such as L. infantum. Until now, in Europe, only measures to reduce sandfly bites have been available, and for many years there has been a strong demand for a vaccine that provides specific and effective immunity. The recent launch of the first European canine leishmaniasis vaccine (CaniLeish) has provided a means to achieve this, but data on its impact on the dog's immune system are required. The data presented here demonstrate the specific stimulation of an effective Th1-dominated anti-L. infantum response within three weeks of the administration of the vaccine, and provides a basis for the understanding of the mode of action of this new tool.
