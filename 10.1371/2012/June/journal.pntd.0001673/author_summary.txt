Sporotrichosis is a sub-acute or chronic granulomatous fungal infection involving mainly the skin and subcutaneous tissue with neighbouring lymphatics. It is caused by thermally dimorphic fungus, Sporothrix schenckii, which is prevalent worldwide. Consequent to trauma, the fungus establishes itself in skin and subcutaneous tissue of gardeners, forestry workers, farmers, carpenters, and others who are involved in outdoor activities. Sporotrichosis is the most frequently encountered sub-cutaneous mycosis in the sub-Himalayan belt and all previous reports are based on clinical review. It is imperative to understand the epidemiology of sporotrichosis as an accurate diagnosis, and prompt initiation of the appropriate treatment would prevent chronic debility. This is the first extensive compilation of culture proven cases from Himachal Pradesh in India. It thus justifies our interest in analysing data from our institute seen over 18 years and 7 months, with the objective to compare the demographic factors, briefing the clinical aspects and the culture characteristics of the isolates obtained from the clinical material.
