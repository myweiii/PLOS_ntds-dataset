Dengue is a common and potentially serious viral illness. Complications include plasma leakage from small blood vessels causing shock and dysfunction of the systems that control blood clotting, resulting in bleeding. The disease used to affect children predominantly, but in recent years, the number of adult patients has been increasing. As there is limited data describing the patterns of complications by age, we performed this study to compare clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcomes of the disease for over 1,500 children and adults with confirmed dengue recruited at the same time at a single hospital in the Southern Vietnam. We found that plasma leakage and shock were more common and severe in children than adults, while bleeding and organ dysfunction were more frequent in adults. Adults had lower platelet counts throughout the illness course as well as at a follow-up visit several weeks after recovery. Platelets are a crucial element in controlling bleeding, and the intrinsically lower counts in adults compared to children may contribute to the greater risk for bleeding in this patient group. Knowledge about differences in the patterns of dengue-related complications between children and adults should help clinicians to diagnose and treat patients more effectively.
