Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widely distributed viral hemorrhagic fever as the disease occurs in much of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, Balkans and Russia. CCHF is a zoonotic viral disease mainly transmitted by ticks, although animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission also occurs. CCHF is asymptomatic in animals but presents a serious threat to humans causing nonspecific flu-like symptoms that may progress to a serious hemorrhagic syndrome with a fatality rate up to 50%. There is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment against CCHF infections and antiviral treatment relies on early confirmation of the disease. In this context, accurate diagnosis and reliable surveillance of CCHF is essential. Diagnostic techniques for CCHF virus (CCHFV) rely more and more on molecular methods, which are rapid, simple and sensitive when correctly standardized. In this study, we present the results of the first international external quality assurance (EQA) for molecular diagnosis of CCHFV. The objective of this EQA is to collect information on the efficiency and accurateness of CCHFV molecular methods applied by expert laboratories. Participants included 44 expert laboratories from 29 different countries worldwide. The study shows uneven performances indicating that there is still a need for improving testing conditions and standardizing protocols.
