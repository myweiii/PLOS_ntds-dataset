Antivenom is the only specific treatment for systemic envenoming from snakebite, but remains unavailable to thousands of snakebite victims around the world. A cycle of inconsistent and low market demand, sub-optimal utilisation, rising costs and reduced output of antivenoms have resulted from long term under-investment in procurement and quality regulatory programs. This study provides a contemporary overview of the African antivenom market within the context of the global market. Globally, 35 companies sold at least 4 million vials of antivenom in 2007. Five companies had established African antivenom markets in 2010/11; three other institutions have antivenoms for Africa in development; and another ceased production indefinitely. Between 2007 and 2011, production of sub-Saharan African antivenoms rose from 227,400 to at least 377,500 vials, constituting âˆ¼83,000 effective treatments for moderate envenomings. However, recent reports have identified that some products, which comprise up to 90% of the total antivenom supply in sub-Saharan Africa, may lack efficacy or specificity against relevant snake species. Despite this, revenues from antivenom marketed in sub-Saharan Africa increased from $6.6 million in 2007 to $10.3 million in 2010/11. The average cost of a stated effective treatment in 2010/11 was $124, and the price of antivenom is inversely proportional to the amount produced. Combined unutilised production capacity far exceeds the total projected antivenom needs for Africa.
