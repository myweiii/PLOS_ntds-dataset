Chagas disease is caused by a protozoan parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. T. cruzi infects a wide variety of mammal species in Latin America as well as man, and is spread by multiple species of blood sucking triatomine insect vectors. The presence of genetic diversity in T. cruzi in the Americas is well established, with six different major genetic types in circulation. The genetic diversity of T. cruzi in Venezuela is relatively poorly understood. In this work we present the results from the genotyping of over seven hundred isolates from 17 of the 24 states. Our dataset comprises strains isolated from wild and domestic animals, several species of triatomine vector, as well as from human Chagas disease cases, including those associated with oral transmission of T. cruzi. Amongst other findings, our data reveal a surprisingly high frequency of atypical genotypes in humans, particularly TcIV, which has rarely been reported. We evaluate our findings in the context of T. cruzi diversity elsewhere in the Americas, and assess the impact they have on the future of Chagas disease control in Venezuela.
