Leishmaniasis, one of the most neglected tropical diseases, affects over 2 million people each year. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as Kala-azar, is caused by the protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum and is fatal if left untreated. Because existing treatments are often ineffective due to parasite resistance and/or toxicity new drugs are urgently needed. Leishmaniasis is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected sandfly. In the insect vector, parasites exist as flagellated formsâ€”promastigotes, which infect macrophage cells of the human host, where they differentiate to round forms known as amastigotes. Amastigotes and promastigotes are substantially different from a molecular perspective. Drug discovery for leishmaniasis has traditionally been complicated by the unavailability of validated drug targets and of relevant drug assays. Whole cell-based assays have been widely used, as they bypass the need for a validated target. However, they use the insect form of the parasite; indeed, the human form, the intracellular amastigote, is difficult to obtain in the laboratory in quantities compatible with drug screening. We describe here the technical advances that made it possible to adapt the intracellular amastigote form of L. donovani to a drug assay compatible with high-throughput screening.
