Trachoma causes blindness through corneal damage from in-turned eyelashes (trachomatous trichiasis [TT]). Trichiasis is treated surgically to correct the anatomical abnormality. Unfortunately, TT frequently returns following surgery, which again puts the person at risk of sight loss. Recurrent trichiasis is multifactorial. We investigated the possible role of various immuno-fibrogenic factors. To do this we operated on 1300 people with TT and followed them up every six months for a two-year period. On each occasion a conjunctival swab was collected for human gene expression analysis. We measured various factors that are thought to be important in inflammation and scarring diseases. The gene expression profile of people who developed recurrent TT was compared to a sample of those that did not have a recurrence. Recurrent TT was associated with increased expression of psoriasin (S100A7) before surgery and on multiple occasions during a two-year follow-up period. S100A7 is able to promote inflammation and may contribute to the development of the scarring process in trachoma.
