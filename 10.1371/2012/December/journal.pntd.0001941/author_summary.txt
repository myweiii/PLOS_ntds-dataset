Programs to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) are designed to interrupt transmission of the parasite by treating the human reservoir of infection. As infection levels decline, assessing infection and transmission levels becomes more and more challenging. In principle, measuring the level of antibody to filarial antigens in children may provide a sensitive measure of transmission intensity. Here, we used samples collected over time from 142 Haitian children living in an area of intense transmission of LF to determine when they first developed antibody responses to defined filarial antigens compared to when they became infected. Antibody responses were measured to several filarial antigens using sensitive assays based on multiplex and LIPS assay methods. Our results show that antibody responses developed before infection could be detected by conventional tests for the presence of microfilariae or antigen in the blood. These results support the idea that antibody tests can be used to monitor the impact of mass drug administration programs on transmission of LF and to carry out surveillance for LF after drug treatments have stopped.
