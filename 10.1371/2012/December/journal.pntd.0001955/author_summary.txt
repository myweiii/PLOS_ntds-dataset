In Brazil, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by the parasite protozoon Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum (syn chagasi), which is transmitted to humans by sandflies that have widespread wild and domestic animal reservoirs. An important issue associated with the control of VL is the need to identify and understand the relevance of asymptomatic infection in the transmission cycle of the parasite. We evaluated the course of asymptomatic infection in children by using molecular methods to detect parasite DNA and to monitor parasitemia level over time. The prevalence of VL, as detected by means of a molecular method, for 1875 children was 13.9%. The data demonstrated a significant decrease in parasitemia after 1 year. Furthermore, the level of parasitemia was generally lower in asymptomatic children than in sick children. None of the asymptomatic children showed signs or clinical symptoms associated with VL throughout the duration of the study. This molecular method of measuring parasitemia is adequate for monitoring VL transmission in areas where it is endemic.
