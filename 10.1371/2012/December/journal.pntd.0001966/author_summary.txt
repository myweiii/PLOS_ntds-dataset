Infection with dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever, the most prevalent mosquito-borne illness of humans worldwide. Tens of millions of cases occur annually; up to 500,000 patients develop additional life-threatening complications, including hemorrhage and shock. The clinical course of the disease evolves rapidly, making it difficult to identify patients at risk for severe disease and suggesting that biological events associated with the development of severe disease may be short-lived. We examined gene expression patterns in the blood of children hospitalized with DENV infection, and found that patients with differences in disease severity and history of previous DENV infection shared a common set of gene expression features, but the timing and magnitude of these features differed. In our study, prior DENV infection explained the greatest amount of variation in gene expression among patients. We discovered features of gene expression on day 3 that were associated with subsequent disease severityâ€”features that were not apparent on subsequent days, emphasizing the importance of looking at temporal patterns of gene expression in acute infection.
