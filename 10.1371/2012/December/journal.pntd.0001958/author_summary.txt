Chagas' disease, a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is transmitted to vertebrate hosts by hematophagous insects. Cruzipain is a lysosomal cysteine peptidase, which plays an important role in parasite infectivity, intracellular growth and differentiation, and is abundantly expressed on the surface of epimastigotes. Since these forms face the insect vector environment during the life cycle, it is conceivable that cruzipain may participate in the interaction process with the invertebrate host. Here, we showed that adhesion of T. cruzi to the insect midgut cells was inhibited by the blockage of cruzipain function. Cysteine peptidase inhibitors, in a dose-dependent manner, and anti-cruzipain antibodies were able to reduce the binding of epimastigote forms to the Rhodnius prolixus midgut. Similarly, T. cruzi transfectants that overexpress chagasin, the endogenous cruzipain inhibitor, displayed low levels of adhesion. Accordingly, the supplementation of exogenous cruzipain partially restored the adherence of the transfected line. Additionally, the ability of the chagasin overexpressing transfectants to colonize the insect in vivo was drastically reduced, and the levels of cruzipain expression by wild-type parasites were enhanced after in vivo passage in R. prolixus. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that cruzipain is required for successful colonization of R. prolixus by T. cruzi.
