Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. HAT is fatal unless treated, yet the current treatment itself can cause death. New treatments are urgently needed. Our study focuses on proteases, which are enzymes that break down proteins. Because of their roles in many centrally important biological processes, proteases are targets for drugs to treat a variety of diseases including parasite infection. The recent explosion of protein sequence and structure information in public databases has made surveys of proteins on a genomic scale possible. However, collecting specific data of interest from diverse databases and synthesizing them in a way that is easy to interpret can be difficult. We used T. brucei and human protease sequences, crystal structures, and models to create network views that show how proteases cluster by similarity. Such views are valuable not only for understanding the evolution of the protein repertoire in each species, but also can give important clues for drug design. Two T. brucei protease groups (“M32” and “C51”) that are very different in sequence from human proteases were examined in structural detail. Based on our analyses, a human ACE2 inhibitor was selected for experimental testing on one of these parasite proteases, TbM32, and was shown to inhibit it.
