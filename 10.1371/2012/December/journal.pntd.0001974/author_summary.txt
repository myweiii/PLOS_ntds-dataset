Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that infects human macrophages to produce the neglected tropical disease known as leishmaniasis. Chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option for leishmaniasis. First-line therapies include pentavalent antimonials, except in some regions in the Indian subcontinent, the liposomal formulation of amphotericin B, miltefosine and paromomycin. The WHO has recently recommended a combined therapy in order to extend the life expectancy of these compounds. However, resistance could be induced in Leishmania if this approach is not applied in a controlled and regulated way, thus resulting in a rapid loss of efficacy of not one but two therapeutic options. In light of this, we have designed relevant experimental studies in order to determine whether Leishmania parasites are able to develop resistance to the different potential anti-leishmanial drug combinations that will be used in the near future. The results obtained could help us to predict the success of drug combination therapy. Experimental resistance of Leishmania donovani promastigotes to drug combinations was obtained after 10 weeks and remained in the intracellular amastigotes. We therefore conclude that L. donovani can easily develop resistance to drug combinations mainly miltefosine/paromomycin and SbIII/paromomycin. These results have been validated in intracellular amastigotes and are of considerable interest for future prediction of the success of drug combination therapy.
