Dengue fever is a mosquito borne viral infection. It has become a major public health problem during the past decades: only 9 countries were affected in the 1970s; dengue is now endemic in more than 100 countries. In the absence of any vaccine or specific treatment, control of dengue fever is currently limited to vector control measures, which are difficult to implement and hardly sustainable, especially in low income countries. To implement efficient control measures, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of propagation of the disease and the key factors underlying these dynamics. In this study, data from 8-year national surveillance in Cambodia were analysed. Dengue fever follows a recurrent pattern of propagation at the national scale. The annual epidemics originate from a few rural areas identified in this work. This study also suggests additional evidence for the role of human movement in the spatial dynamics of the disease, which should be accounted for in control measures. These results differ from the current knowledge about dengue dynamics and are therefore of interest for future research.
