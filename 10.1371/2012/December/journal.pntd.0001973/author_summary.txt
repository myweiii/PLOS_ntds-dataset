The protozoan flagellate Leishmania donovani causes the neglected, life-threatening disease visceral leishmaniasis. Parasites are transmitted from man to man by the bite of the sand fly Phlebotomus argentipes, the vector of the disease. Pentavalent antimonials have been the mainstay of antileishmanial therapy for decades but rapidly increasing failure rates up to 65% observed between 1980 and 1997 in the state of Bihar, India, have challenged further use of these drugs. Comparative in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that antimony-resistant parasites have a higher fitness than antimony-sensitive ones even in the absence of antimonial treatment. Simulation studies based on a previously published mathematical L. donovani transmission model suggest that resistance to antimonial treatment alone cannot explain the Bihar observations but that resistance together with higher fitness offers the potential to explain the data. After an antimony-resistant parasite with higher fitness has emerged, it will finally replace the antimony-sensitive ones, even in complete absence of antimonial treatment.
