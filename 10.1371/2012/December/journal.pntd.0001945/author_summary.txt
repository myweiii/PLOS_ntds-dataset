Fishborne Zoonotic Trematodes (FZT) are an important public health challenge in Vietnam and other Asian countries where consumption of raw or inadequately cooked fish is part of the diet. Nearly half of the seafood consumed globally originates from aquaculture in particular produced in Asian countries. Therefore, control programs to prevent FZT infections in fish produced from aquaculture are needed for limiting or preventing these neglected fishborne diseases. During an investigation over two years on FZT infections in aquaculture nurseries, we found a positive correlation between potential snail host population size and FZT infection rates in fish. Clearly, the role of the snail vectors and their interaction with fish is crucial for development of effective control programs. However, snail populations external to the fish pond are also a potential source of cercariae, must be included in the design of FZT prevention programs for fish farms.
