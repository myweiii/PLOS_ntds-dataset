Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae), is an ancient infectious disease that remains the leading infectious cause of disability. After infection, M. leprae lives inside host macrophages that contain a large amount of lipids, which is thought to be an essential microenvironment for M. leprae to survive in host cells. M. leprae infection increases lipid accumulation in macrophages and decreases the metabolic breakdown of lipids (catabolism). In addition, the treatment of leprosy with multidrug therapy (MDT) reverses the effect of infection on the modulation of lipid metabolism. We therefore aimed to use cultured human macrophage cells to determine which of the three MDT drugs (clofazimine, dapsone, or rifampicin) is responsible for this effect. We found that only clofazimine affects lipid accumulation and catabolism in M. leprae-infected cells in vitro. The amounts of lipids accumulated in the cells decreased when clofazimine was added to the cell culture medium. Clofazimine also activated immune responses in M. leprae-infected cells. These results suggest that the effectiveness of clofazimine against leprosy is due to the modulation of lipid metabolism and activation of immune reactions in M. leprae-infected host cells.
