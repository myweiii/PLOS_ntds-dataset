The zoonotic parasite Calodium hepaticum is the causative agent of rarely reported liver disease (hepatic calodiasis) and spurious infections in humans. In spurious infections eggs of this parasite are excreted in the stools without causing disease. It has been suggested that the cause of this type of infection in Amazonian areas is the ingestion of liver of wild mammals infected with the eggs of the parasite. Nonetheless, studies are needed to confirm this mechanism of transmission and investigate its epidemiological importance. In the present study we report the high individual (6.7%) and household incidence (50%â€“83.3%) of spurious infection in a rural community of the Brazilian Amazon. We found a high risk of spurious infection among subjects who usually ate the liver of wild mammals and detected a source of spurious infection in humans (peccary liver) as well as, for the first time, ground contamination with infected dog feces in a household presenting human cases. We confirm the existence of this mechanism of transmission of C. hepaticum and suggest that it is important for transmission not only in this area but probably also in other areas of the Amazon with similar sociocultural characteristics.
