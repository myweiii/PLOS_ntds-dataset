The rapid and long term establishment of parasites such as L. amazonensis, otherwise known to strictly rely on subversion of macrophage and dendritic leucocyte (DL) lineages, is expected to reflect stepwise processes taking place in both the skin dermis where the infective form of the parasite and the skin-draining lymph node (DLN) were inoculated. Relying on mice of two distinct inbred strains—C57BL/6 and DBA/2—that rapidly and durably display distinct phenotypes at the two sites of establishment of L. amazonensis, we were curious to address the following question: could live L. amazonensis-hosting DL display unique signatures that account for the distinct phenotypes? Based on flow cytometry, genechip and real-time quantitative PCR analyses, our results did evidence that, once subverted as cells hosting live L. amazonensis, DLs from C57BL/6 or DBA/2 do display distinct profiles that could account for the i) distinct parasite load profiles, ii) as well as the distinct macroscopic features of ear pinna observed once the L. amazonensis metacyclic promastigotes completed their four day developmental program along the amastigote morphotype.
