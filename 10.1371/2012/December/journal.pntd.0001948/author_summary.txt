Brugian filariasis is a debilitating neglected tropical disease caused by infection with the filarial parasites Brugia malayi or Brugia timori. Adult worms live in the lymphatic system and produce large numbers of microfilariae that predominantly circulate in the blood at night. Bloodsucking mosquitoes spread the disease by ingesting microfilariae that develop into infective stage larvae in the insect. In rural areas, diagnosis still relies largely on microscopic examination of night blood and morphological assessment of stained microfilariae. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a technique that can amplify DNA with high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity under isothermal conditions. The operational simplicity, versatility and low-cost of the technique make it particularly appealing for use in diagnosis and geographical mapping of neglected tropical diseases. In the present study, we have developed and evaluated a Brugia Hha I repeat LAMP assay for the rapid detection of B. malayi and B. timori genomic DNA. The results indicate that the Brugia Hha I repeat LAMP diagnostic assay is sensitive and rapid, detecting a single microfilariae in blood within 30 minutes, and Brugia-specific. The test has the potential to be developed further as a field tool for use in the implementation and management of mass drug administration programs for brugian filariasis.
