Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in West Africa is a lethal, neglected disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense transmitted by the tsetse fly Glossina palpalis gambiensis. Although the littoral part of Guinea with its typical mangrove habitat is the most prevalent area in West Africa, very few data are available on the epidemiology of the disease in such biotopes. We carried out a cross-sectional study of the distribution and abundance of people, livestock, tsetse and trypanosomes in the active focus of Boffa. We only found T. b. gambiense in the area, no other trypanosome. T. b. gambiense was found parasitologically in humans (45 cases), and suspected serologically in other humans and in two animals. Tsetse flies were present in high densities in places very frequented by humans, such as pirogue jetties, and watering points. Our results confirm the importance of medical surveys to find cases and treat them, but also point out the limit of strategies targeted at HAT patients only. If sleeping sickness is to be eliminated, a vector control component must be added to the strategy of case detection and treatment, and this latter must be directed to the population the most at risk.
