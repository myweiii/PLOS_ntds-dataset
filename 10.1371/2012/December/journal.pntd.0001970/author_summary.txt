Tuberculosis prevalence is high in areas that are endemic for helminths, suggesting that many people are chronically infected with both pathogens. As parasitic helminths can suppress the host immune system to facilitate their own survival, they frequently impact the host immune response to bystander antigens. Thus, while helminth infections ameliorate allergies and autoimmune diseases, they also decrease immune responses elicited by vaccines. Several studies have shown that helminth exposure impairs Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific immune responses, raising the possibility that helminth infections may decrease the host's ability to control M. tuberculosis infection. To test this, we analyzed whether chronic infection of cotton rats with the filarial worm Litomosoides sigmodontis exacerbates the course of M. tuberculosis infection. Cotton rats are an excellent model organism to study human M. tuberculosis as they develop, in contrast to mice, distinct granuloma formation during infection. In addition, cotton rats are the natural host for L. sigmodontis, a nematode that establishes long-lived infections (>2 years) with circulating microfilariae in these animals. The results of this study demonstrate that chronic filarial infection does not exacerbate M. tuberculosis-associated pathology or mycobacterial burdens in cotton rats and suggest that filaria-induced immunoregulation can be overcome to respond effectively to newly acquired infections.
