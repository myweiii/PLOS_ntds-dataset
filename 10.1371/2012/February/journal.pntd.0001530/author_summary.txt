Chagas disease is one of the most important tropical diseases in America. This disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted through the feces of blood-sucking insects known as triatomines. Different species of insects have different habits and food sources that confer variable degrees of epidemiological importance. In this paper, we propose the use of High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis of cytochrome b (cyt b) gene PCR products to identify blood-food sources in triatomines. This tool can effectively differentiate blood-meal sources of insects collected from the field. Such data allows for targeted investigations of insect species that are likely to be involved in the transmission of the parasite to humans in different regions. This knowledge is very important because it allows establishing and designing vector control and surveillance strategies according to each geographical area and to stop the transmission of the parasite to human populations by insects.
