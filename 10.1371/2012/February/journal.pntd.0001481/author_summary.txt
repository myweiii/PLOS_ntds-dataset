The liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini mainly occurs in Lao PDR and Thailand. Humans become infected through the consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked freshwater fish. Chronic infections may lead to severe liver (bile duct) diseases that eventually develop into a bile duct cancer with extremely poor prognosis. Current control efforts aim at preventing heavy morbidity and mortality. In recent years, spatial modeling, using data from well designed surveys, has been employed to better understand the distribution and determinants of parasitic diseases for guiding subsequent control. However, a spatial modeling approach has not been used for O. viverrini before. The purpose of the current study was to map the distribution of O. viverrini infection in Champasack province in southern Lao PDR, to identify risk factors of infection, and to predict the distribution at non-surveyed locations. We found that the risk of O. viverrini infection is higher for people living in close proximity to freshwater bodies, whereas the lack of sanitation sustained environmental contamination and transmission. High risk zones in Champasack province are concentrated in the Mekong River corridor, and hence control efforts should be targeted along the Mekong River.
