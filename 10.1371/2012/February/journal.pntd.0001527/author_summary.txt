Infection with the filarial parasite Loa loa causes a parasite-specific downregulation of T cell responses. However, differences exist (clinical and immunologic) between patients born and living in filarial endemic regions (endemics) and those who become infected during travel or short-term residency (expatriates). T cell responses are more depressed in endemics while expatriates have more clinical “allergic-type” symptoms. In this study, we showed that these differences reflect transcriptional differences within the T cell compartment. Using microarrays, we examined global gene expression in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of microfilaremic endemic and expatriate patients and found differences not only ex vivo, but also to parasite and, for CD8+ cells, to nonparasite antigens. Functional analysis showed that endemic patients expressed genes linked to inflammatory disease and caspase associated cell death at homeostasis while expatriates tended to have a more activation-induced gene profile at homeostasis and a CD4+ inflammatory response to parasite antigen. Patient groups were similar in their CD4+ response to nonparasite antigen but strongly differed in their CD8+ responses, demonstrating the potential global ramifications of chronic, longstanding infection. Our study describes potential transcriptional mechanisms for the variability seen in patients with different levels of exposure to and chronicity of filarial infection.
