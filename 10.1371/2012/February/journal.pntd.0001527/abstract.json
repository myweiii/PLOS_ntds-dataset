    "Background": "Human filarial infection is characterized by downregulated parasite-antigen specific T cell responses but distinct differences exist between patients with longstanding infection (endemics) and those who acquired infection through temporary residency or visits to filarial-endemic regions (expatriates).",
    "Methods and Findings": "To characterize mechanisms underlying differences in T cells, analysis of global gene expression using human spotted microarrays was conducted on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from microfilaremic Loa loa-infected endemic and expatriate patients. Assessment of unstimulated cells showed overexpression of genes linked to inflammation and caspase-associated cell death, particularly in endemics, and enrichment of the Th1/Th2 canonical pathway in endemic CD4+ cells. However, pathways within CD8+ unstimulated cells were most significantly enriched in both patient groups. Antigen (Ag)-driven gene expression was assessed to microfilarial Ag (MfAg) and to the nonparasite Ag streptolysin O (SLO). For MfAg-driven cells, the number of genes differing significantly from unstimulated cells was greater in endemics compared to expatriates (p<0.0001). Functional analysis showed a differential increase in genes associated with NFkB (both groups) and caspase activation (endemics). While the expatriate response to MfAg was primarily a CD4+ pro-inflammatory one, the endemic response included CD4+ and CD8+ cells and was linked to insulin signaling, histone complexes, and ubiquitination. Unlike the enrichment of canonical pathways in CD8+ unstimulated cells, both groups showed pathway enrichment in CD4+ cells to MfAg. Contrasting with the divergent responses to MfAg seen between endemics and expatriates, the CD4+ response to SLO was similar; however, CD8+ cells differed strongly in the nature and numbers (156 [endemics] vs 36 [expatriates]) of genes with differential expression.",
    "Conclusions": "These data suggest several important pathways are responsible for the different outcomes seen among filarial-infected patients with varying levels of chronicity and imply an important role for CD8+ cells in some of the global changes seen with lifelong exposure."
