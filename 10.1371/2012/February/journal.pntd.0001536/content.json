    "Introduction": "Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is caused by infection with dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus, which consists of four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4). DENV affects up to 100 million people annually living in the tropics and sub-tropical areas. Clinical manifestations of DENV infection ranges from asymptomatic and relatively mild dengue fever (DF), to severe, life-threatening illness, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1], [2]. In endemic regions, the risk for developing severe infection was speculated to be higher as compared to non-endemic regions due to the higher possibility of secondary exposure to heterologous DENV serotypes [3], [4]. The number of dengue patients has increased in Malaysia over the past 10 years with 7,103 cases and 45 deaths in 2000, to 41,486 cases and 88 deaths in 2009, to, 46,171 cases and 134 deaths in 2010 [5], [6]. All four DENV serotypes co-circulate in Malaysia [7], [8]. High prevalence of severe dengue virus infections and dengue-related deaths in recent years is speculated to be associated to rapid urbanization and global travel, leading to the spread of dengue virus, and thus to higher prevalence of infected individuals [9]\u2013[11].\nPrimary infection with one DENV serotype does not confer protection to infection with a heterologous serotype [12], [13]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that DHF occurs at a higher rate in secondary infection than in primary infection [14]\u2013[17]. DENV sub-neutralizing, infection-enhancing antibodies induced during primary infection is speculated to play a central role in the pathogenesis of DHF [18]\u2013[21]. During secondary infection, sub-neutralizing antibodies form infectious immune-complexes with DENV, resulting in higher levels of viral progeny in Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells, a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [22], [23]. It has been speculated that ADE may play a role not only in causing DHF but in worsening a spectrum of DENV illness [24].\nWe previously demonstrated that higher neutralizing antibody titers were detected using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells as compared to Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells [25]. In the present study, we examined DENV infection-enhancing activity in serum samples with varying levels of DENV neutralizing activity using Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells.",
    "Materials and Methods": "Serum samples\nEighty serum samples obtained from 80 residents in Perak, Malaysia were used in the study. Perak is located in north-western region of Peninsular Malaysia, and is endemic for dengue, and other flavivirus infections [26]\u2013[28]. Incidence of DENV infection in Perak was 2,288 in 2010, 2,734 in 2009, and, 4,119 in 2008 [6]. The serum samples were collected in 2008 and were provided by National Public Health Laboratory, Malaysia. Characteristics of the patient population sampled are summarized in Table 1.\n\n\nEthics statement\nThe study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the National Institute Infectious Diseases, Japan (Reference no. 210). Patients were de-identified and study data was analyzed anonymously.\n\n\nDengue diagnostics\nPatient serum samples used in the present study were examined for the presence of dengue viral RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and NS1 antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Viral RNA was extracted using High Pure RNA extraction kit (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) and DENV serotypes were determined by serotype-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [29]. For serological tests, serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes before use. Detection of the NS1 antigen was performed using Platelia Dengue NS1 Antigen (Bio-Rad Laboratories, France) according to manufacturers' instructions. After reaction was terminated, optical density readings (OD) were obtained with a spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 450 nm/620 nm and the index of each sample was calculated with the following formula: OD of samples/OD of calibrators. The index value of each sample was interpreted according to manufacturer's instructions; index values of <0.9, 0.9\u20131.1, and, >1.1 were considered negative, equivocal, and positive, respectively [30].\n\n\nViruses and cell lines\nDengue virus type 1 (DENV-1), 01-44-1HuNIID strain (GenBank accession no. AB111070), dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) D2/Hu/OPD030NIID/2005 strain (GenBank accession no. AB219135), dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) CH53489 strain (GenBank accession no. DQ863638), and, dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) TVP360 strain were used. BHK cells, a hamster kidney cell line (Japan Health Science Research Resources Bank, Japan) and Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells were used. Cells were cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) (Sigma, USA), supplemented with heat inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Sigma) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells were cultured in EMEM (Sigma), supplemented with heat inactivated 10% FCS (Sigma) and 0.5 mg/ml neomycin (G418, PAA Laboratories GmbH, Austria) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 [25].\n\n\nPlaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)\nHeat-inactivated human serum samples were serially diluted 2-folds from 1\u22365 to 1\u22361250 with EMEM/2% FCS. As the amount of serum samples was limited, two replicates were tested for each of the serum samples to four dengue serotype. Virus-antibody mixture was prepared by mixing 25 \u00b5l of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, or, DENV-4 at titers of 2000 PFU/ml with 25 \u00b5l of serum samples serially diluted 2 folds from 1\u22365 to 1\u22361250. For infection with DENV alone, the mixture was prepared by mixing 25 \u00b5l of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, or, DENV-4 strains at titers of 2000 PFU/ml with 25 \u00b5l of EMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes, 50 \u00b5l of virus-antibody mixture was inoculated on Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK and Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK monolayers in 12-well plates. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. After virus absorption, the cells were washed once with 1 ml of EMEM (Sigma) and overlaid with 1 ml EMEM (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Japan) containing 2% FCS (Sigma) and 1% methylcellulose (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan). The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 5\u20137 days, when plaque formation could be confirmed by naked eye. Cells were then fixed with 10% formalin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and stained with methylene blue (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Number of plaques was counted with naked eye. Plaque-reduction neutralizing test (PRNT50) end points are expressed as the last serum dilution showing a 50% or greater reduction in plaque counts as compared to the number of plaques determined from wells of cells infected in the absence of antibodies [31].\n\n\nAntibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay\nFor enhancement assay against 4 DENV serotypes, 25 \u00b5l serum samples diluted at 1\u22365 with EMEM/2% FCS were used. Virus-antibody mixture was prepared by mixing 25 \u00b5l of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, or, DENV-4 strains at titers of 1000\u20132000 PFU/ml with 25 \u00b5l of 1\u22365 diluted serum samples and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes. For negative controls, virus mixture was prepared by mixing 25 \u00b5l of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, or, DENV-4 strains at titers of 1000\u20132000 PFU/ml with 25 \u00b5l of 2% FCS/EMEM and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes. Fifty microliters of the virus-antibody mixture was then applied to Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK monolayers in 12-well plates. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. After virus absorption, the cells were washed with 1 ml of EMEM and overlaid with 1 ml EMEM containing 2% FCS and 1% methylcellulose. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 5 days. Cells were then fixed with 10% formalin and stained with methylene blue. Plaques were counted with naked eye. Fold enhancement values were determined using the following ratio: (mean plaque count at 1\u223610 serum dilution)/(mean plaque count in the absence of human serum samples, negative control). The sum of the mean of the negative control plus two times of the standard deviation (SD) value obtained from 4 wells of negative control was used as cut-off to differentiate enhancing and non-enhancing activity [32], [33]. Enhancing activity was defined as positive when values are greater than the mean plaque count in the absence of human serum samples plus a greater than 2 times SD.",
    "Results": "Neutralizing and infection-enhancing activities of serum samples collected in Perak, Malaysia\nEighty serum samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibody to each of the four DENV serotypes by using BHK cells (Table 1). Neutralizing antibody (PRNT50\u226510) was detected in 69% (55/80) to DENV-1, 60% (48/80) to DENV-2, 56% (45/80) to DENV-3 and, 20% (16/80) to DENV-4. Of the 80 samples, 12 samples and 13 samples were obtained from patients with acute DENV-1 and DENV-3 infections, respectively (Table 1). Neutralizing activity to DENV-1 was detected in 58% (7/12) of the DENV-1 infected patients and that to DENV-3 was detected in 62% (8/13) of the DENV-3 infected patients. In contrast, enhancing-activity to DENV-1 was detected in 33% (4/12) of the DENV-1 infected patients and that to DENV-3 was detected in 61% (8/13) of the DENV-3 patients (Table 2). Five DENV-1 infected patients and two DENV-3 infected patients demonstrated neither neutralizing nor infection-enhancing activity to any of the four DENV serotypes (Table S4). Four (58%) of the 7 serum samples from acute secondary DENV-1 infected patients demonstrated infection-enhancing activities to DENV-1 serotype and similarly, 8 (73%) of 11 serum samples from acute secondary DENV-3 infected patients enhanced DENV-3 infection. The results indicate that serum samples from dengue patients and non-dengue patients in dengue endemic region, Malaysia, possess neutralizing and infection-enhancing activities (Table S1, Table S2). The history of past dengue infections of each of the patients was however, not known. Because Malaysia is endemic for dengue infection, and some of the serum samples exhibited high levels of neutralizing antibody titers to DENV, it is highly likely that the patients with high neutralizing antibody activity has been previously exposed to DENV infection.\n\n\nDifference in neutralizing antibody titers to 4 DENV serotypes determined by using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells and Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells\nThe 18 samples derived from acute secondary dengue patients which demonstrated both neutralizing and infection-enhancing activities were examined for neutralizing antibody titers to each of the 4 DENV serotypes. The serum samples were from 7 acute secondary DENV-1 patients and 11 acute secondary DENV-3 patients (Table 1). Using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells, 7 serum samples possessed neutralizing antibody titers only to DENV-2 and 11 samples showed neutralizing antibody to more than one serotype (Table 3, Table S3). All the serum samples except one (17 of 18) demonstrated neutralizing antibody titers to DENV-2 at titers of 1\u223610 to 1\u22361280. Using Fc\u03b3R-positive BHK cells, 13 serum samples obtained from patients with DENV-1 or DENV-3 infection possessed neutralizing antibody titers only to DENV-2 (1\u223610 to 1\u2236160), and 2 samples possessed neutralizing antibody titers only to DENV-1 (1\u223610 to 1\u223620). Some of the non acute dengue patients (serum sample no. 23, 28, 30, 38, 73, 74, 77, 78, 79, Table 4) exhibited heterotypic neutralizing activity using BHK cells but monotypic neutralizing activity using Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells, as those observed in patients with acute secondary dengue infection (Table 3).\nInterestingly, serum samples from patients with acute secondary infection (#46, 49, 56, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 52, and 54) demonstrated neutralizing antibody titers of 1\u223610\u20131\u223680 to the infecting serotype as determined using BHK cells, but these serum samples showed no neutralizing antibody titers to the infecting serotype as determined using Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells (Table 3). The results indicate that neutralizing antibody titers determined by using Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells were lower than those determined by using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells, and that for some of the samples, neutralizing antibody titers were detected only by using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells, but not by using Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells. Major target cells of DENV in vivo are Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells such as monocyte-lineage cells [34]\u2013[37]. The results suggest that the titers determined by using Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells may, thus, reflect actual biological activities of antibodies in vivo.\n\n\nEnhancing activity to 4 DENV serotypes in serum samples with neutralizing activity\nFold-enhancement to DENV-1 ranged from 0.7\u20135.6; DENV-2, <0.1\u20132.1, DENV-3, 0.9\u20134.9, and DENV-4, 1.1\u20137.0 with serum sample from patients with infecting serotype of DENV-1. Fold-enhancement to DENV-1 ranged from <0.1\u20135.5; DENV-2, <0.1\u20132.3; DENV-3, 0.6\u20136.7, and DENV-4, 0.9\u20137.1 with serum samples from patients with infecting serotype of DENV-3 (Table 4, Table S3). Some of the samples from non acute dengue patients also exhibited enhancing activity to DENV (Table S1).\nThe results indicate that sera from patients with DENV infection possess the ability to enhance the infection by the infecting serotype. The ability of serum samples with DENV neutralizing activity to enhance each of the 4 DENV serotypes at 1\u223610 serum dilution was analyzed (Figure 1). Serum samples with neutralizing titers of \u22651\u223610 determined by using BHK cells demonstrated lower levels of fold-enhancement to the homotypic serotypes. Fold enhancement to DENV-1 of serum samples with DENV-1 neutralizing antibody (NA) titer of \u22651\u223610 was 0.8\u00b10.9 versus DENV-1 NA titer <1\u223610\u200a=\u200a4.5\u00b11.6 (P<0.01). Fold infection-enhancement to DENV-2 using serum samples with DENV-2 neutralizing antibody (NA) titers of \u22651\u223610 was 0.6\u00b10.9, while that of samples with DENV-2 NA titers <1\u223610 was 1.9\u00b11.1 (P<0.01). Fold enhancement to DENV-3 of serum samples with DENV-3 neutralizing antibody (NA) titer of \u22651\u223610 was 0.9\u00b11.1, while DENV-3 NA titers <1\u223610\u200a=\u200a3.9\u00b12.1 (P<0.01). Fold enhancement to DENV-4 of serum samples with DENV-4 neutralizing antibody (NA) titer of \u22651\u223610 was 3.6\u00b12.0, while that of samples with DENV-4 NA titers <1\u223610 was 4.9\u00b11.9 (P\u200a=\u200a0.02) (Figure 1). Serum samples with high levels of neutralizing activity to DENV-2 (40, 42, 44, 49, 54 and 58) exhibited peak fold enhancement ranging from 5.8\u20137.6 at higher serum dilutions of 1\u2236100\u20131\u22361000 (Figure 2).\nSixty serum samples exhibiting neutralizing activity to DENV were analyzed for presence of infection-enhancement activity to each of the four DENV serotypes: (A) DENV-1, (B) DENV-2, (C) DENV-3 and, (D) DENV-4. Infection-enhancement activity to each DENV serotype was determined by using Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells by the formula: (mean plaque count at 1\u223610 serum dilution)/(mean plaque count in the absence of human serum samples), and expressed as fold enhancement to each DENV serotype. Closed bars indicate serum samples with neutralizing titer PRNT50\u226510 to the indicated DENV serotype and open bars indicate serum samples with neutralizing titer PRNT50<10 as determined using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells. (*) indicates P<0.05.\nSix serum samples with high neutralizing activity to DENV-2 at 1\u223610 serum dilutions were tested for presence of infection-enhancement activity to DENV-2 at serum dilutions of 1\u223610 to 1\u2236106. (A) serum sample #40, (B) #42, (C) #44 (D) #49, (E) #54 and, (F) #58. Infection-enhancement activity to each DENV serotype was determined by using Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells and BHK cells by the formula: (mean plaque count at each serum dilution)/(mean plaque count in the absence of human serum samples), and expressed as fold enhancement to DENV-2. Closed bars indicate Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells and open bars indicate Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells.\nOf the 55 serum samples from non acute dengue patients, 42 exhibited infection-enhancement activity to DENV (Table S1). Enhancement activities against DENV-1 and DENV-3 using serum samples obtained from 7 patients with acute DENV-1 infection (mean fold-enhancement\u200a=\u200a3.1, P\u200a=\u200a0.02, and mean fold-enhancement\u200a=\u200a3.2, P\u200a=\u200a0.02 respectively) were significantly higher than to those of samples from non-acute DENV patients with multitypic neutralizing activity to \u22653 DENV serotypes (mean fold-enhancement\u200a=\u200a0.6 to DENV-1, mean fold-enhancement\u200a=\u200a0.8 to DENV-3). Similarly, enhancement activities against DENV-3 of samples from 11 patients with acute DENV-3 infection (mean fold-enhancement\u200a=\u200a2.4, P\u200a=\u200a0.04) were higher than those of samples from non acute DENV patients with multitypic neutralizing activity to \u22653 DENV serotypes (Table S5).\nUsing serum samples at 1\u223610 dilution, neutralizing activities were higher in samples from patients with multitypic neutralizing activity to \u22653 DENV serotypes (mean percentage of DENV-1 plaque reduction\u200a=\u200a92%, DENV-3 plaque reduction\u200a=\u200a92%) than in those from patients with acute secondary DENV-1 infection (DENV-1 plaque reduction\u200a=\u200a43%, P<0.01; DENV-3 plaque reduction\u200a=\u200a34%, P<0.01) and, than in those from patients with acute secondary DENV-3 infection (DENV-1 plaque reduction\u200a=\u200a63%, P\u200a=\u200a0.02; DENV-3 plaque reduction\u200a=\u200a55%, P<0.01) (Table S6).\nNeutralizing titers were higher in samples from non acute dengue patients with neutralizing activity to multitypic DENV than in those from patients with acute primary and secondary DENV infection. In contrast, enhancing activity was significantly lower in non acute dengue patients with neutralizing activity to multitypic DENV than in those from patients with acute secondary DENV infection (Table S5). The results suggest that serum samples with high neutralizing activity possess no or only low levels of infection-enhancing activity to respective serotypes at low serum dilutions. In contrast, serum samples without neutralizing activity possess high levels of enhancing activity.",
    "Discussion": "The relationship between neutralizing activity determined using Fc\u03b3R-negative cells and infection-enhancing activity determined using Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells was examined in the present study. We determined that a high proportion of the serum samples from residents of a DENV endemic country, Malaysia, possessed DENV neutralizing and infection-enhancing activity (75%, 60/80; Table 2). The neutralizing antibody titers were higher when determined by using Fc\u03b3R-negative cells than when determined by using Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells (Table 3). Mammalian cells such as Vero cells and BHK cells are commonly used in plaque reduction neutralizing tests [39]. However, in the absence of Fc\u03b3R, these cells exclusively detect neutralizing antibody titers. Other investigators have suggested that the use of Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells, including monocyte-lineage THP-1 cells and K562 cells, dendritic cells, Fc\u03b3R-expressing CV-1 and BHK cells, and, DC-SIGN expressing RAJI cells and U937 cells may better reflect the in vivo neutralizing titers [40]\u2013[46]. Surrogate plaque titration assays are, however, required to determine virus titers in non-adherent monocyte-lineage cells. Infection-enhancement was also detected using an Fc\u03b3R-expressing cell line, THP-1 cells, for a subset of serum samples (#39, 40, 28 and 77) which exhibited high infection-enhancement activity to DENV-4 using Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells (data not shown). Thus, the results of ADE assays were consistent between THP-1 cells and Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK. In addition, serum samples (#46, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 52 and 54) that demonstrated neutralizing antibody titers to DENV-2 (1\u223610 to >1\u22361280) along with neutralizing activities to other serotypes in Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells exhibited neutralizing antibody only to DENV-2 in Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells. Cross-reactive neutralizing activity determined using Fc\u03b3R-negative cells was not detected using Fc\u03b3R-positive cells. This could be due to hampered neutralizing activity to heterologous serotypes by infection-enhancing activity [25], [42], [47]. Importantly, our results suggest that the Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells provides more informative data on serotype-specific neutralizing activity, and may better reflect protection in vivo.\nPresence of infection-enhancing activity in antibodies with neutralizing activity to the infecting serotype has been reported previously [37], [38], [47]. Interestingly, despite the result that 11 serum samples from patients with DENV infection exhibited neutralizing activity to the infecting serotype at 1\u223610\u20131\u223680 as determined by using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells, the neutralizing titer to the respective infecting serotypes as determined by using Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells was <1\u223610 in all of the 11 serum samples tested. It has been reported that the main target cells of DENV infection in vivo are Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells, such as monocytes and macrophages [34]\u2013[36]. The results suggest that DENV-antibody complexes which are incapable of infecting Fc\u03b3R-negative cells, may retain the ability to infect Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells due to the presence of Fc\u03b3R. However, further studies are required to identify the relationship between infection-enhancing activity and neutralizing activity during infection in vivo.\nAll four DENV serotypes are found co-circulating in Malaysia. Although data was not available for the pre-dominant dengue virus serotype in Perak prior to 2008, DENV-2 was the dominant circulating serotype in peninsular Malaysia between 1998\u20132000 and 2006\u20132007 (Chua et al., unpublished data). High levels of neutralizing activity against DENV-2 were detected in some of the serum samples (Table 3), indicate that these individuals may have been previously exposed to DENV-2. Previous studies have suggested that ADE activity influences disease severity in patients with secondary DENV infection [32], [48]. As low levels of serum dilutions may better reflect in vivo conditions, serum samples at dilutions of 1\u223610 were used in the present study. The results showed infection-enhancing activity (fold enhancement) of 0.7\u20136.7 to the infecting serotype at serum dilutions of 1\u223610. The assay using Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells detected infection-enhancing activity to infecting serotypes at low serum dilutions in serum samples with neutralizing activity, suggesting the presence of ADE activity in vivo. Interestingly, there was an inverse relationship between infection-enhancement activity to a DENV serotype and high neutralizing activity as determined by using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells to the respective serotypes (Figure 2, Table 3, Table 4).\nPrevious studies showed that higher dilutions of patient serum samples, in quantities that are not sufficient to support neutralization, enhance DENV infection [32], [47]. Patient serum samples #49, 58, 42, 45, and 54, require higher concentrations for neutralization in the presence of Fc\u03b3R than in the absence of Fc\u03b3R. In addition, serum samples #57, 23, 28, 30, 74, 77, and 78 exhibited similar neutralizing antibody titers in both Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cells and Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells [25]. Some antibodies may require lower threshold occupancy for neutralization, and, thus, virus neutralization may occur at similar concentrations both in Fc\u03b3R-negative and Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells. Alternatively, binding of some antibodies may lead to DENV conformational changes [49], and therefore, result in virus neutralization both in the presence and absence of Fc\u03b3R, at similar antibody concentrations. The Fc\u03b3R-expressing BHK cell-based assay system is unique as antibody neutralizing activity could be analyzed and compared simultaneously using one cell line (BHK cell line) either in the absence or presence of Fc\u03b3R by a conventional plaque assay.\nIt is known that primary infection with one DENV serotype induces long-term protection to infection with the same serotype [50]. By using serum samples from a DENV-endemic area, we demonstrated that infection-enhancing activity which was determined only by using Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells hampers neutralizing activity that was determined using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells. Moreover, infection-enhancing activity was also detected in serum samples with low or negative neutralizing activity that were determined using Fc\u03b3R-negative BHK cells. Although in vitro systems may not faithfully reflect all aspects of DENV infection in vivo, the results suggest that as compared to the neutralizing activity determined by Fc\u03b3R-negative cell culture system, the sum of neutralizing and enhancing activity determined by the Fc\u03b3R-expressing cells may better reflect protection to DENV infection in vivo. Further studies are, however, needed to define the relationship between protection and neutralizing titers determined by using Fc\u03b3R-positive cells."
