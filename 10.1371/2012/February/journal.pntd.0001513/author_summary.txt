Strongyloides stercoralis (Nematoda) is an important parasite of humans, causing Strongyloidiasis, considered as one of the most neglected diseases, affecting more than 100 million people worldwide. Chronic infections in endemic areas can be maintained for decades through the autoinfective cycle with the L3 filariform larvae. In these areas, misdiagnosis, inadequate treatment and the facilitation of hyperinfection syndrome by immunosupression are frequent and contribute to a high mortality rate. Among the affected areas, chronic patients have been described in the Valencian Mediterranean coastal region of Spain. Despite its serious impact, very little is known about this parasite and its relationship with its hosts at the molecular level, and more effective diagnostic tests and treatments are needed. Next generation sequencing technologies now provide unique opportunities to rapidly advance in these areas. In this study, we present the first transcriptome of S. stercoralis L3i using 454 sequencing followed by semi-automated bioinformatic analyses. Our study identifies 8037 putative proteins based on homology, gene ontology, and/or biochemical pathways, including putative excretory/secretory proteins as well as potential drug targets. The present dataset provides a useful resource and adds greatly to our understanding of a human parasite affecting both developed and developing countries.
