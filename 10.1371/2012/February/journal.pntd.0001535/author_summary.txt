This paper reports the strategy of oral rabies vaccination of wildlife in Estonia, the measures undertaken to check the method's efficacy and the results obtained. Initiated in autumn 2005, oral vaccination programmes resulted in a dramatic decrease in rabies incidence. All the recommended tests were regularly applied, including the systematic testing of vaccine baits prior to release in the field, serological testing and bait uptake assessment in adult and young animals as well as the typing of all rabies virus isolates. The disease was completely controlled by March 2008, with only three cases reported in summer 2009 and one case in January 2011 in areas very close to the South-Eastern border. The costs associated with rabies control have been calculated and compared on a similar basis for the three Baltic countries. The example of rabies control in Estonia shows that rabies can be quickly and successfully eliminated through successive oral vaccination campaigns by strictly following the recommendations of international organisations. These recommendations concern general strategy, vaccination method and choice of vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing extensive data from a rabies control programme. The underlying strategy, leading to rabies elimination, is advantageous in terms of cost/effectiveness.
