Grateful thanks are due to Mrs M.A. Kafil-Emiola Schistosomiasis Control Programme Officer, Ogun State, for selection of the study villages, recruitment of the field workers and preparing the ground work. Technical support from Mrs E. Fadairo and O. Abioye as well as Mr S. Oginleve and many others as well as the participants of all the villages included in this study. We would like to thank Dr Linda Muthen for help with the MPLUS software and codes. Scientific advancement is built upon the work of others, ofttimes work that lies in a reference and is then obscured. We authors are cognizant of this because in developing this test process we made use of discoveries published by Dr Joseph Hamburger and Dr Ibrahim Abbasi of the Kuvin Centre in Jerusalem, Israel.
