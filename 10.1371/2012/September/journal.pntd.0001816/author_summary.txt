In Brazil, American tegumentary leishmaniasis is mainly caused by Leishmania braziliensis infection. Usually, it begins as a solitary skin lesion, which is called Localized Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (LCL). However, after this lesion heals, 5% of the patients may develop destructive lesions of the mucosa of nose and throat, which is called Mucosal Leishmaniasis (ML). Currently, there is no technology to identify individuals at risk for ML, and the factors that control the evolution to ML remain unknown. This work aims to study the human gene expression patterns that may contribute to the clinical manifestation of the disease. We used the RNA-Seq technique to study skin lesions from individuals that had LCL (LCL group) and those who developed ML (ML group). Our results suggest that individuals that progressed to ML expressed low levels of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses, which might lead to insufficient control of the infection. We were also able to identify a potential gene expression signature to predict long-term disease outcome.
