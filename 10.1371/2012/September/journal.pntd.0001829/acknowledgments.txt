We gratefully thank the population of Ndieumeul and Diokhor Tack and the village chiefs, Daoure Mbaye and Daouda Pene, for their hospitality and participation in this study. This study would not have been possible without the field workers in Richard Toll, Abdoulaye Yague, Mankeur Diop, Moussa Wade and Ngary Sy, who assisted in the sample collection and microscopic analysis. We would also like to thank Boubacar Fofana and Ahmed Dieng for their help with the ultrasound examinations, the medical staff of the Health Centre in Richard Toll for their support, and Tine Huyse for her helpful suggestions.
