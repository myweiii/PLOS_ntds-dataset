During the course of infection, trophozoites of E. histolytica need to cope with the oxidative stress in order to survive under the oxidative environment of its host. As a result of the absence of the key eukaryotic anti-oxidative defense system, it needs to employ novel defense strategies. Several studies such as transcriptomic profiling of trophozoites exposed to oxidative stress, and biochemical and functional analysis of individual proteins has been done in the past. Since, oxidative stress damages several metabolic enzymes, and modulate expression of many genes, it is important to analyze the detailed metabolomic response of E. histolytica upon oxidative stress to understand the role of metabolism in combating oxidative stress. In the present study, we demonstrated that oxidative stress causes glycolytic inhibition and redirection of metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.
