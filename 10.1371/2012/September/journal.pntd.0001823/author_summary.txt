Bunyamwera and serologically related viruses are widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions, and cause febrile illness in man. The viruses possess a trisegmented genome and can evolve by genetic reassortment generating viruses with different pathogenicity, like Ngari virus, a reassortant between Bunyamwera and Batai viruses, which causes haemorrhagic fever in humans. Like other arthropod-transmitted viruses, Bunyamwera virus can replicate efficiently in both mosquito and mammalian cells. Infected mammalian cells are killed by the virus whereas mosquito cells become persistently infected. Understanding the molecular basis for this difference may be crucial in designing new approaches to control bunyavirus disease. The viral non-structural NSs protein is the major virulence factor, which counteracts the innate immune defences of mammalian cells. In contrast, the role of this protein during infection of vector mosquito cells is unknown. We compared the replication of wild type virus and a genetically engineered virus that does not express NSs in various cultured mosquito cell lines and in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We showed that some cells did not support mutant virus replication, implying a role for the NSs protein. NSs protein was also important for efficient replication and dissemination in potential vector species.
