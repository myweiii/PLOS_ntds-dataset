Leishmaniasis is a global disease, which is treated with expensive compounds. Anti-leishmaniasis therapy causes severe side effects, and parasite resistance is often observed, which highlights the importance of discovering new drugs against its causal agent, the protozoan parasite Leishmania. Recently, the geographical overlapping distribution of leishmaniasis and the infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of individuals infected with Leishmania.
The dolabellene diterpene Dolabelladienetriol, purified from the marine algae Dictyota pfaffii collected along the northeast coast of Brazil, presents anti-HIV-1 activity. In this paper, we report that Dolabelladienetriol reduces the number of Leishmania amazonensis in host cells. We found that Dolabelladienetriol decreased the Leishmania load even in the presence of factors that exacerbate parasite growth, such as cytokines and HIV-1 co-infection. Our data may call attention to Dolabelladienetriol as a promising candidate for future studies regarding the treatment of leishmaniasis alone or in association with HIV-1 coinfection.
