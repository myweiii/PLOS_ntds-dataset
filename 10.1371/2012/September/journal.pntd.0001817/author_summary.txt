Leishmania spp. are pathogenic protozoa characterized by a substantial diversity in pathogenesis and virulence despite their considerable synteny at the genome level. The existence of genetic exchange was recently proven experimentally in the sand fly vector where hybrid parasites were isolated and generated. Here, we show the feasibility of generating Leishmania hybrids by electroporating genomic DNA of donor cells into recipient Leishmania parasites. This methodology was made possible by introducing a drug resistance marker in the donor Leishmania cells that could be used for selecting recombinant recipient parasites. Integrations of exogenous DNA fragments as large as 45 kb were possible for several chromosomal regions and took place at homologous loci in recipient Leishmania strains. Our observations are the first step for the generation of in vitro hybrids for assessing gene function under natural genomic contexts and this technology may be applicable to other pathogens.
