The control of onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is based on annual or six-monthly treatment with ivermectin of populations at risk. This has been effective in controlling
the disease as a public health problem but it was not known whether it could also eliminate infection and
transmission to the extent that treatment could be safely stopped. Many doubted that this was feasible in Africa. A
study was undertaken in three hyperendemic onchocerciasis foci with seasonal transmission in Mali and Senegal
where treatment has been given for 15 to 17 years. As a result of this treatment, infection and transmission levels
had fallen everywhere below postulated thresholds for elimination. Treatment was therefore stopped in each
focus. Follow-up evaluations up to 5 years after the last treatment showed no evidence of recrudescence after
stopping treatment but instead a consistent decline in infection and transmission levels, reaching zero in two
sites. The study has established the proof-of-principle that onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment is
feasible in at least some endemic foci in Africa. The results of the study have greatly contributed to the current
evolution from onchocerciasis control to elimination in Africa.
