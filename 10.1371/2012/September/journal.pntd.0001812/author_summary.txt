A coproantigen-detection technique (MM3-COPRO ELISA) was evaluated in 436 and 362 schoolchildren of Huacullani, Bolivia, and Cajamarca valley, Peru, respectively. Classical techniques for egg detection were used for comparison. In Huacullani, using Kato-Katz as gold standard, sensitivity and specificity were 94.68% and 98.48%, respectively, and using Kato-Katz and COPRO-ELISA test together, they were 95.68% and 100%, respectively. In Cajamarca, using rapid sedimentation and Kato-Katz together, these results were 94.73% and 93.58%, respectively, and using rapid sedimentation, Kato-Katz and copro-ELISA together, results were 97.56% and 100%, respectively. There was no correlation between coproantigen detection by optical density (OD) and infection intensity by eggs per gram of feces (epg) in Cajamarca low burden cases (<400 epg), nor in Huacullani high burden cases (â‰¥400 epg), although there was in Huacullani low burden cases (<400 epg). Six cases of egg emission appeared negative by MM3-COPRO, including one with a high egg count (1248 epg). The coproantigen-detection test allows for high sensitivity and specificity, fast large mass screening capacity, detection in the chronic phase, early detection of treatment failure or reinfection in post-treated subjects, and usefulness for surveillance programs. However, this technique falls short when evaluating the fluke burden on its own.
