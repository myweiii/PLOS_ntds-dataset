Infection by the soil-transmitted helminth Trichuris trichiura is defined as ‘light’, ‘moderate’ and ‘heavy’ depending on its intensity. However, these intensity categories were developed in the 1980s, before any epidemiological data were available on the association between specific T. trichiura infection intensities and adverse health outcomes. Here, we re-analyzed data from a study of T. trichiura infection and anemia in pregnant women to determine the threshold (i.e. the lowest infection intensity) associated with an increased risk of anemia. Women with T. trichiura infections of intensities ranging from 601 to 1632 eggs per gram of feces (epg) (ie. a ‘moderate’ level of intensity) had a significantly higher prevalence of anemia and a significantly lower hemoglobin level than the reference group (i.e. women with T. trichiura infections of intensities ranging between 0 and 24 epg). This finding contrasts with the common belief that only ‘heavy’ T. trichiura infection (10,000 epg and above) can cause anemia.
