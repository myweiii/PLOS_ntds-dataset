Echinococcus metacestodes form a laminated layer and develop strategies to escape host immune responses once the infection established on the liver of intermediated host. One of the most important strategies is thought to be immunoregulation, where some molecules (e.g., antigen B) impair dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and polarize immature DC maturation towards a non-protective Th2 cell response. Therefore, it is more feasible to kill Echinococcus oncospheres in the early stage of infection in the intestine and blood. Systemic and local immune responses are believed to play a crucial role on oncosphere exclusion. Among antigen delivery systems, i.n. administration is the most efficient one, inducing both systemic and a full-range of mucosal immune responses. FAP is necessary to M. avium and S. pyogenes to efficiently attach and invade epithelial cells, and has been suggested as a potent vaccine adjuvant. Mucosal immune responses are induced after FAP binds to the fibronectin protein of host microfold (M) cells and DCs are activated. We developed a one-step delivery system where FAP and other Ags can be expressed, purified and immunized as one protein. The systemic and, in particular, the mucosal antibody responses induced by the fusion protein were detected to evaluate the adjuvanticity of FBP.
