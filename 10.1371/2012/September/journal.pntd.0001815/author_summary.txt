Diagnosis of schistosomiasis is problematic since no method is yet available that gives both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The method traditionally used is microscopy, but because of inherent insensitivity this technique often wrongly diagnoses patients as uninfected. Use of serological assays involving detection of specific antibodies is now increasing since the putative sensitivity of these tests is much higher than that of other alternative methods of diagnosis. They are routinely used in travellers' medicine clinics where often only light infections are encountered which microscopy is not sensitive enough to detect. ELISA incorporating schistosome soluble egg antigens (SEA) is often the antibody-detection test of choice. The use of the SEA-ELISA for diagnosis of schistosomiasis in developing countries is however restricted since SEA is relatively expensive to produce. Here we investigated whether a cheaper alternative S. mansoni antigenic preparation derived from schistosome cercariae (SmCTF) could potentially replace SEA in ELISA. Our results demonstrate that SmCTF performs equivalently to S. mansoni SEA for the diagnosis of both S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections, and that SmCTF is also as good as S. japonicum SEA for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis japonica. We discuss how even more affordable and practical diagnostic aids for schistosomiasis might be developed.
