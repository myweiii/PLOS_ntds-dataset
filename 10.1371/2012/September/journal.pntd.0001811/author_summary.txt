Plasmodium vivax is the most frequently transmitted and widely distributed cause of malaria in the world. Each year P. vivax is responsible for approximately 250 million clinical cases of malaria and its global economic burden, placed largely on the poor, has been estimated to exceed US$1.4 billion. In contrast to P. falciparum, P. vivax cannot be propagated in continuous in vitro culture and this limits our understanding of the parasiteâ€™s biology. In this study, we sequenced the entire genome of five P. vivax isolates directly from blood samples of infected patients. Our data indicated that each patient was infected with multiple P. vivax strains. We also identified more than 80,000 DNA polymorphisms distributed throughout the genome that will enable future studies of the P. vivax population and association mapping studies. Our study illustrates the potential of genomic studies for better understanding P. vivax biology and how the parasite successfully evades malaria elimination efforts worldwide.
