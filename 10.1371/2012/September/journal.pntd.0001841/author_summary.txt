Death adders are a genus of venomous snakes found in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Death adder envenoming is a rare but important health problem in Australasia. Definite death adder bites were recruited as part of the Australian Snakebite Project (ASP). Clinical effects, laboratory results and response to antivenom treatment were recorded for each case. Death adder envenoming was confirmed by enzyme immunoassay in blood collected from patients. The most important clinical effect was neurotoxicity, which was mild in most cases. One vial of antivenom was shown to be effective at binding circulating death adder venom. However, antivenom had little effect on the neurotoxicity that developed
in envenomed patients and neurotoxicity took on average one day to resolve. This study supports the idea of presynaptic neurotoxicity in death adder envenoming which was previously thought to be due to post-synaptic neurotoxicity. The study calls into question the benefit of antivenom, with poor response shown in patients with both mild and severe envenoming.
