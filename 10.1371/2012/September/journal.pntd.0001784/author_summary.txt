Dengue is a major health problem in the tropics and the incidence of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in Brazil experienced a significant increase since the emergence of dengue virus type-3 (DENV-3). In this study, the authors reconstruct the spatio-temporal dispersion pattern of the DENV-3 lineage that circulates in Brazil and the Americas. The authors found that DENV-3 outbreaks occurring in the American continent since the mid-1990s are the result of a single introduction of genotype III. The       Central American countries and Mexico were the hubs of genotype III spread in the Americas, while the Caribbean region acted as a staging post between Central America/Mexico and South America. The authors estimate that there have been at least four introductions of the DENV-3 genotype III in Brazil, although only two of them succeeded in getting established and disseminating through the country. The Lesser Antilles (Caribbean) were the main source of DENV-3 viruses that arrived into Brazil,and the North and Southeast country regions seem to be most important hubs of introduction and dissemination of DENV-3 lineages. These findings offer important information to perform more effective surveillance programs to detect introduction and dispersal of new DENV lineages in       Brazil.
