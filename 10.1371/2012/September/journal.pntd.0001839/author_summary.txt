In the past, diagnostic testing for Lassa fever patients in Nigeria has been performed nearly exclusively outside of the country. Patients thus were managed on-site based on clinical suspicion alone, posing risks to patients and health care workers and exhausting resources. To tackle this problem, we established a diagnostic PCR laboratory directly at a referral hospital serving a Lassa fever endemic area in Nigeria. Long-term collaboration between partners in the North and the South was crucial to implement this project. Training of laboratory staff in the partner institutions and on-site, mobilization of local human and financial resources, good management of the laboratory, a basic quality management and control system, and a stable supply chain for consumables and reagents were among the key factors for success. The laboratory reliably delivered results in a short turnaround time, despite some problems due to PCR contamination. The service has improved patient and contact management including treatment with ribavirin and led to better protection of health care workers against hospital-acquired infections. The data provide new insights into disease progression and a basis for further optimization of case management including supportive treatment.
