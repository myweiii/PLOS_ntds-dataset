The large global assembly of parasite prevalence data was critically dependent on the generous contributions of data made by a large number of people in the malaria research and control communities and these individuals are listed on the MAP website (http://www.map.ac.uk/acknowledgements). We thank Professor David Rogers for providing the Fourier-processed remote sensing data. We are grateful for the comments of three anonymous referees that have helped strengthen the manuscript.
