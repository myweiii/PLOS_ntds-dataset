Leishmania parasites are the causative agent of a spectrum of diseases characterized by severe lesions in skin or life threatening visceral infections. In the parasite life cycle, a range of morphological transitions can be found such as amastigotes (hosted in humans and others mammals) and promastigotes (located in the sand fly vector). The disease begins when the infective non-dividing promastigote metacyclic form is transmitted to mammalian hosts by the bite of an infected sand fly. The conditions for the development of these metacyclic promastigotes are still not fully understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that the presence or absence of purine will determine whether the parasite will proliferate or differentiate into the metacyclic form. Our experiments indicate that the presence of purines in the culture medium of Leishmania parasites interfere with the development of metacyclic promastigotes. Our results also show that although decreased proliferation and metacyclic differentiation occur simultaneously these two phenomena are independently regulated. Finally we show, for the first time in a natural vector, that metacyclogenesis is inhibited in vivo by adenosine, suggesting a new level of cell differentiation control in these protozoan parasites which is driven by purine sensing.
