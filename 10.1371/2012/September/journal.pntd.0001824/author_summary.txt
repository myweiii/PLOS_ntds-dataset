A characteristic feature of most helminth infections is the convex age infection profile, where infection levels rise to peak in early childhood and decline in adulthood, a pattern thought to result from the development of protective acquired immunity. Thus, several investigations characterizing protective responses to inform vaccine research have focused on responses present in older people, who despite continued exposure to infection carry
little or no infection. To date, such studies have identified key responses which are correlates of resistance. However, there is a paucity of information on cell types that are mediators rather than effectors of the immune responses. One such group where there are limited studies in human schistosome infections is dendritic cells which are important for the polarizations of CD4+ T cell responses. Therefore, we characterized the age profile of dendritic cells in Zimbabweans exposed to Schistosoma haematobium infection. We found an age-related pattern in the proportions of myeloid dendritic cells (a subset of dendritic cells) in this population. Furthermore, in the case myeloid dendritic cells, the age profile differed between schistosome infected and un-infected people. Thus our study suggests that activation and migration of myeloid dendritic cells also develop in an age-related pattern consistent with the cumulative history of exposure to schistosome parasites.
