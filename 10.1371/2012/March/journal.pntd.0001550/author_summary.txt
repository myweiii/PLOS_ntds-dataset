Micronutrient deficiency and intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) share a similar geographical distribution. A conservative estimate indicated that almost 2 billion individuals suffer from anaemia due to iron deficiency (ID), corresponding to 24.8% of the world's population. Crucially, most of these individuals are children and women of reproductive age in developing countries. Intestinal parasitic infections, especially soil-transmitted helminthes (STH), are prevalent in areas where micronutrient deficiency is widespread and the relationship between them has been studied. Most studies have noted an association between iron deficiency and IPIs. Against this background we studied the association between micronutrient deficiency, IPIs and socioeconomic factors among rural children in West Malaysia. Overall, 26.2%, 54.9% and 16.9% of the participants had anaemia, ID and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), respectively. The overall prevalence of STH infections was 76.5% with Trichuris trichiura (71.5%), Ascaris lumbricoides (41.6%) and hookworm (13.5%). Univariate analysis found that low level of mother's education, i.e., less than 6 years of formal education, non working parents, low house income, T. trichiura infection and A. lumbricoides infection were significantly associated with the odds of IDA. The final multivariate analysis indicated that low level of mother's education was a significant predictor for IDA in these children.
