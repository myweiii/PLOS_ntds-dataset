    "Background": "Given that micronutrient deficiency, neglected intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) and poor socioeconomic status are closely linked, we conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the relationship between IPIs and nutritional status of children living in remote and rural areas in West Malaysia.",
    "Methods/Findings": "A total of 550 children participated, comprising 520 (94.5%) school children aged 7 to 12 years old, 30 (5.5%) young children aged 1 to 6 years old, 254 (46.2%) boys and 296 (53.8%) girls. Of the 550 children, 26.2% were anaemic, 54.9% iron deficient and 16.9% had iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). The overall prevalence of helminths was 76.5% comprising Trichuris trichiura (71.5%), Ascaris lumbricoides (41.6%) and hookworm infection (13.5%). It was observed that iron deficiency was significantly higher in girls (p\u200a=\u200a0.032) compared to boys. Univariate analysis demonstrated that low level of mother's education (OR\u200a=\u200a2.52; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.38\u20134.60; p\u200a=\u200a0.002), non working parents (OR\u200a=\u200a2.18; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a2.06\u20132.31; p\u200a=\u200a0.013), low household income (OR\u200a=\u200a2.02; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.14\u20133.59; p\u200a=\u200a0.015), T. trichiura (OR\u200a=\u200a2.15; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.21\u20133.81; p\u200a=\u200a0.008) and A. lumbricoides infections (OR\u200a=\u200a1.63; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.04\u20132.55; p\u200a=\u200a0.032) were significantly associated with the high prevalence of IDA. Multivariate analysis confirmed that low level of mother's education (OR\u200a=\u200a1.48; 95 CI%\u200a=\u200a1.33\u20132.58; p<0.001) was a significant predictor for IDA in these children.",
    "Conclusion": "It is crucial that a comprehensive primary health care programme for these communities that includes periodic de-worming, nutrition supplement, improved household economy, education, sanitation status and personal hygiene are taken into consideration to improve the nutritional status of these children."
