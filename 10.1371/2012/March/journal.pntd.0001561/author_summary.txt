Dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. During their lifecycle, mosquitoes are exposed to a variety of microbes, and many of them inhabit the mosquito midgut, thereby sharing the same environment with ingested pathogens. The mosquito midgut is the site of multiple reciprocal interactions between the mosquito, its commensal bacteria, and ingested pathogens that will ultimately influence the level of pathogen infection and transmission. In this study the authors addressed the reciprocal interactions between the Aedes immune system, dengue virus and mosquito midgut microbiota using molecular and microbiological assays. The study showed that certain field-derived bacterial isolates of the mosquito midgut exert a detrimental effect on dengue virus infection. This effect is at least partly manifested through the action of the mosquito immune system which is activated by microbes. Conversely, dengue virus infection induces immune responses in the mosquito midgut tissue that act against the natural mosquito midgut microbiota. This study contributes to our understanding of dengue virus infection in Aedes mosquitoes, which may aid towards the development of novel biocontrol strategies to halt dengue transmission.
