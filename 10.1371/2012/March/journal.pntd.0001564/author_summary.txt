There are currently no vaccines available to combat helminth (worm) infections in humans. The most devastating of the diseases caused by human helminths are schistosomiasis (or bilharzia) and hookworm disease. By fusing one of the lead schistosomiasis vaccine antigens, Sm-TSP-2, with a protective fragment from one of the lead hookworm vaccine antigens, Na-APR-1, we have produced a chimeric vaccine, termed Sm-TSP-2/5B that might provide protection against two debilitating and co-endemic neglected tropical diseases. Sm-TSP-2/5B provided increased protection compared to Sm-TSP-2 alone when formulated with human approved adjuvants and tested in a mouse model of schistosomiasis. Moreover, IgE against Sm-TSP-2 or Na-APR-1 has not been detected in the blood of residents from an area in Brazil that is endemic for schistosomes and hookworms, indicating that vaccines based on these molecules would be unlikely to generate allergic reactions in recipients from developing countries.
