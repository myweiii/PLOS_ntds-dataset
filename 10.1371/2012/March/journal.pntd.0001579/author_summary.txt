Schistosomiasis remains a serious parasitic disease worldwide. Adequate case-finding is important and crucial for the effective control programs as schistosomiasis control programs are chiefly based on treatment of infected populations. However, the currently available diagnostic assays are not ideal, and DNA detection can provide useful alternative approaches for the sensitive and specific diagnosis of schistosomiasis, provided that reliable genetic markers are employed in the tests. However, different target sequences used for DNA detection of samples showed different sensitivity. In previous studies, we identified a 230-bp sequence of high sensitivity and specificity from the retrotransposon SjR2 of Schistosoma japonicum. Here, new primers based on 25 novel retrotransposons were designed and their sensitivities and specificities for detecting S. japonicum DNA were compared. Of these, a new 303-bp DNA sequence from the non-LTR retrotransposon (SjCHGCS19) had high sensitivity and specificity in detecting S. japonicum DNA. More importantly, we also found that both the SjCHGCS19 (303-bp sequence) and SjR2 (230-bp sequence) have high repetitive copies, higher genome proportions and active ESTs in the genome of S. japonicum. Our findings provide new insights into selecting suitable target sequences which may play a key role for the sensitive and specific detection of S. japonicum DNA.
