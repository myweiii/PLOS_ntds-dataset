We thank the GESNOMA healthcare workers in Zinder, Niger, the healthcare workers of “Sentinelles” in Zinder, Niger, and Lausanne, Switzerland, and Martina Rusconi for her contribution as dental hygienist. We also thank the healthcare workers and the administration of the University of Geneva Hospitals for their dedication to patient care and logistic support in the field of humanitarian medicine. This project would not have been possible without the efforts of Denys Montandon, our group's “founding father.” Special thanks to Ms. Gertrude Hirzel for her continued support and encouragement.
