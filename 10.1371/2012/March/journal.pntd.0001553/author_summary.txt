Schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) are a major public health problem in Cameroon. The national control strategy of these diseases was based on historical data collected 25 years ago, which might be outdated in some situations due to several factors including control activities, improved or degraded sanitation and hygiene, socio-economic improvement and disease transmission dynamics. To help planning, improving control strategies and evaluation of control activities, there was a need to update the distribution of schistosomiasis and STH. We conducted parasitological surveys in three regions of Cameroon, i.e. Centre, East and West. Our results showed a significant decrease of STH infection prevalence and intensities in all these three regions, in comparison to previous mapping data, with an overall decline of prevalence from 81.1–93% to 10.5–46.6%. These results show the positive impact of annual deworming campaigns, and illustrate the progressive success of the national programme for the control of schistosomiasis and STH in Cameroon. Furthermore, our results showed an increase of the number of high transmission foci of schistosomiasis, and allowed identifying new health districts requiring mass treatment with praziquantel, and those where deworming should be reinforced.
