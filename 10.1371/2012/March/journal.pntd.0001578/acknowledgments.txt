We thank the previous directors of the OCP, in particular Dr. K.Y. Dadzie (who read and approved an earlier version of this manuscript), as well as the staff from its Biostatistics Unit. The analysis of these data would not have been possible without the work by the staff of the Epidemiological Evaluation Unit of the OCP and all those involved in the coordination, execution, and recording of the epidemiological surveys. We also thank three anonymous referees for their valuable comments on a previous version of this paper.
