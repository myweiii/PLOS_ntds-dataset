O. viverrini is among the few parasites considered a Class 1 carcinogen because of its strong association with bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma). Currently, more than 40 million people are infected with O. viverrini worldwide. Thailand has the highest prevalence of O. viverrini at 10 million people infected and also the highest incidence of Opisthorchis-associated bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) in the world. In the current study, we also show that levels of IL-6 in plasma are associated in a dose-dependent fashion with Opisthorchis-induced bile duct fibrosis (periductal fibrosis) and cholangiocarcinoma. More importantly, we show that O. viverrini infection alone does not elevate IL-6 levels in the plasma. It is only in the presence of these advanced pathologies (advanced fibrosis or cholangiocarcinoma) from chronic O. viverrini infection that significantly elevates plasma levels of IL-6 are observed. Moreover, we show that plasma IL-6 is an easily accessible biomarker for the detection of advanced periductal fibrosis and cholangiocarcinoma, which would be a critical advance for this region of Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia, where the prevalence of O. viverrini infection can reach as high as 80% and the incidence of bile duct cancer is the highest in the world.
