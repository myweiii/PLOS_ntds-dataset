Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by one of four serotypes of Dengue virus (DENV-1-4). Dengue has escalated in geographic distribution and disease severity to become the most common arboviral infection of humans. There are no vaccines or specific therapies for dengue and the treatment is supportive. Immunopathogenesis of dengue disease is also poorly understood, in part, due to of the absence of proper animal models of infection. Here, we describe the phenotype of infection of immunocompetent mice with an adapted DENV-3 strain. Infection caused an inoculum-dependent lethality that was preceded by significant clinical, virological and biochemical changes resembling the severe manifestations of human infection. In addition, we demonstrate that IFN-γ production is essential for the host to deal with DENV-3 infection in a manner similar to that demonstrated previously for DENV-2. Hence, reduced IFN-γ production during DENV-3 infection was associated with diminished NOS2 expression and Nitric oxide production. Mice deficient for each of these molecules presented more severe disease manifestation and increased viral replication. Therefore, we describe a model of DENV-3 infection in immunocompetent mice that proves to be an interesting tool to study host–virus interactions and mechanisms mediating protection or those associated with severe disease manifestation.
