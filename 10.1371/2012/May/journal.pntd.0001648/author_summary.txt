Despite mass vaccination campaigns and large scaled improvements in global surveillance, infectious diseases are a worldwide problem. In recent years, the ability to use models as a tool to help visualize, understand and combat infectious diseases has become more feasible and reliable. In this context, modelling focuses on transmission patterns between the different animal, human or vector components as well as including parameters which affect these pathways such as environmental, climatic or geographic ones. The output of these models can help in decision making processes concerning control purposes, surveillance methods and hopefully also as good predictive tools. Prediction forms part of surveillance systems, and more specifically in early warning systems. It is the timely collection and analysis of data as well as the use of risk-based assessments in order to aid in prompt health interventions such as movement control, vaccination campaigns or the distribution of important information. Early warning systems for vector borne diseases are especially complex due to the involvement of various factors originating from the human, animal and insect sector as well the disease itself. The authors investigate the variety and depth of available models for dengue fever surveillance and their use as early warning tools.
