Understanding drug mode of action is of fundamental importance. Of the five drugs in use against human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), convincing evidence on a specific mode of action has been proposed only for the polyamine pathway inhibitor eflornithine. Eflornithine is currently used with nifurtimox as first line treatment of stage 2 CNS-involved HAT. Here, we present a new way of determining the mode of action of a drug by measuring how the levels of small molecules comprising the cellular metabolome are perturbed when exposed to drugs. We show that eflornithine causes the changes in polyamine metabolism previously known to underlie its mode of action. Furthermore, we show that nifurtimox, is rapidly metabolised and significantly alters metabolism. Nifurtimox and eflornithine do not show the predicted synergy with regard to trypanocidal activity and this is reflected in metabolomic analysis where perturbations to the metabolome are additive with no additional changes observed in the combination.
