Junín virus (JUNV), which is endemic to the Argentinean Pampas region, is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), a severe illness with hemorrhagic and neurological manifestations and with a case fatality of 15–30%. Clinical studies demonstrate that elevated levels of interferon and cytokines are produced in AHF patients, which might be correlated to the severity of disease. However it remains unclear, especially during virus infection, how human cells can sense virus infection and respond by activation of IFN pathway. Our studies clearly demonstrated that JUNV infection could activate type I IFN response in human cells. IFN pathway activation occurred in cells infected with either virulent strain or attenuated vaccine strain of JUNV. Our data also revealed for the first time that RIG-I was required for type I IFN production during virus infection in human cells. Interestingly, both strains of JUNV were relatively insensitive to human IFN treatment, which might have implications for the role of the IFN on virus infection in vivo. Overall, these results indicate that JUNV infection could induce host IFN response and provide new insights into JUNV and host interaction as well as the mechanism underlying AHF.
