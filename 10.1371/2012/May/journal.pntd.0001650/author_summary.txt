Chagas disease is a neglected parasitic disease transmitted by bugs (vectors) and represents a serious health problem in the Americas. Although the transmission generally occurs in the houses where the bugs are living, wild populations of vectors are now considered a problem because these populations might enter the houses and recolonize them after eliminating of house populations by insecticide spraying. This is the case of the Southern countries where Triatoma infestans, the principal vector, transmits Trypanosoma cruzi the agent of the disease. This parasite presents a large genetic variability and it is important to know which T. cruzi genotypes are carried by the vectors. The authors found that in the wild T. infestans from the Bolivian Andean region, a principal group of genotype was circulating. In the lowlands (Bolivian Chaco), another additional genotype group was detected. Together with exploring at large scale which genotypes are infecting T. infestans wild populations, this study opens the discussion on the origin T. cruzi genotype groups. Also this study completes our basic knowledge on T. cruzi subspecific genetic variability, and therefore brings new tools for molecular epidemiology of Chagas disease.
