Leishmania mexicana is an intracellular parasite that causes two polarly opposed diseases: One is a self-limited disease, characterized by ulcerative lesions associated with a low infectious load, as found in patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL). And the other pole is characterized by a progressive disease where abundant parasites spread uncontrollably throughout the skin inside heavily infected phagocytic cells, as occurs in patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The cause of this severe form of the disease is unknown, although the early encounter between the parasite and the inflammatory response of the host possibly plays a decisive role in the disease outcome. We here show that polymorphism in the gene encoding IL-1β (−511 C/T) represents a variable influencing the risk to develop the disease for patients infected with Leishmania mexicana. In vitro experiments showed that monocytes of DCL patients secreted significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β as compared to LCL patients. DCL patients also had augmented levels of IL-1β in serum, and the cytokine was diffusely distributed throughout lesions, which was correlated with the numbers of parasites in the lesions. We propose that IL-1β possibly plays a key role in establishing the disease severity in patients infected with Leishmania mexicana.
