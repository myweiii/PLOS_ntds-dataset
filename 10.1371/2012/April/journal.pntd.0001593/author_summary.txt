Examining the genome of the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni, we have identified and defined the structure of a family of 13 allergen-like proteins from the outer layer (tegument) of the organism. We term these molecules the S. mansoni Tegument-Allergen-Like proteins (SmTALs). During S. mansoni infection the human host is exposed to skin-invading larvae, adult-worms (living in the blood) and to parasite eggs. These life-stages have very different sizes, tissue composition and gene expression. We have produced 6 SmTAL proteins with different life-cycle transcriptional patterns and measured IgE antibody responses to them in 200 infected males from an S. mansoni endemic area. The binding of IgE to foreign proteins is important in allergy but also in defence against parasitic worms. Our results suggest that, in these endemic areas, there is priming and boosting of IgE responses to adult-worm SmTALs by the occasional death of long-lived worms, desensitization to egg SmTALs due to continuous exposure to dying eggs and low immunogenicity of larval SmTALs perhaps due to immunosuppression in the skin by the parasite. Schistosome infection is a major health problem in many countries. Our work provides insight into what provokes and controls the antibody responses associated with human immunity to this parasite.
