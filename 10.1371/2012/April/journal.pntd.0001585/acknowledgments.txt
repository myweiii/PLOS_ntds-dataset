We would like to thank the staff of the State Ministry of Health for Unity State for their support in implementing the surveys. Dr Stanley Bubikire from the Ugandan Ministry of Health provided training of health staff on the WHO simplified grading system, while Dr Daniel Balinanseko and Ms Evelyn Grace Adero conducted trachoma grading in the field. We would also like to thank all of the surveyors for their hard work under extremely strenuous field conditions. Furthermore we would like to express our thanks to Paul Emerson and colleagues from The Carter Center for sharing their trachoma prevalence data, for development of the gold standard dataset that was used to investigate the likely effect of different sampling approaches. We are also grateful to Simon Brooker for his suggestion on the sampling analyses and to the reviewers for their helpful suggestions on improvements to the manuscript.
