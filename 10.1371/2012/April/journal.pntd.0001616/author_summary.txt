Despite the efforts to treat registered leprosy patients, the number of new cases reported globally remains stable and high (about 200,000/year). As the treatment of multibacillary leprosy patients, the major recognized source for new infections, did not allow the expected reduction in new leprosy cases, additional sources must be considered. Following exposure to M. leprae infection, the evolution to active disease is estimated to take from 2 to 10 years, and it is conceivable that some of these asymptomatic individuals could be a yet unrecognized source of infection. Previously, the use of computational tools allowed us to select M. leprae-specific genes or gene regions, and derive M. leprae-specific synthetic peptides from the M. leprae genome. Ex vivo stimulation of the blood leukocytes with a subset of these peptides induced IFN-Î³ production that allowed the differentiation of individuals exposed to M. leprae from unexposed ones. Individuals with no known history of exposure to M. leprae, but living in an area with high frequency of leprosy cases had high-level positive responses to the peptides. This last observation raised the possibility of using this test as a tool for evaluating the level of transmission of M. leprae infection in areas of interest.
