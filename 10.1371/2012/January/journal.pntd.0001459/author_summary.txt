Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic disease that has an important mortality and morbidity impact in Latin America, mainly affecting rural workers of Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. Upon host infection, one of the most important aspects contributing to disease outcome is the initial encounter of the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis fungus with dendritic cells. This phagocytic cell is specialized in decoding microbial information and triggering specific immune responses. Thus, using a molecular biology technique to examine the response of thousand of genes, we aimed to identify the ways in which murine dendritic cells interact with P. brasiliensis during an early time point following infection. This approach allowed us to recognize diverse modulated genes, in particular those associated with a proinflamatory response and fungal recognition. Our work provides an initial molecular characterization of early infection process and should promote further investigations into the innate host response to this important fungal pathogen.
