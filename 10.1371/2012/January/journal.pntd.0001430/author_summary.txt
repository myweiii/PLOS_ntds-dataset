Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is an important emerging zoonosis caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum in the Mediterranean and Middle East and L. (L.) chagasi (syn. L. (L.) infantum) in Latin America. Due to their genotypic relationships, these species are considered identical. The present study focused on comparing the protein expression profiles of the promastigote and amastigote-like stages of L. infantum, by means of a protein separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis and identification by mass spectrometry. The present study attempted to identify proteins recognized by antibodies present in the sera of dogs with asymptomatic and symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis. A total of one hundred and four proteins were identified. Of these, several stage-specific proteins had been previously identified as diagnosis and/or vaccine candidates. In addition, antibodies from infected dogs recognized thirty-one proteins, which had been previously considered hypothetical, indicating that these proteins are expressed during active infection. Therefore, the present study reveals new potential candidates for the improvement of diagnosis of CVL.
