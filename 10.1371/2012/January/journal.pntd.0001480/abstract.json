    "Abstract": "To assess the burden of neurocysticercosis (NCC) in California we examined statewide hospital discharge data for 2009. There were 304 cases hospitalized with NCC identified (incidence\u200a=\u200a0.8 per 100,000). Cases were mostly Latino (84.9%), slightly more likely to be male than female (men 57.6%, women 42.4%) with an average age of 43.5 years. A majority of cases were hospitalized in Southern California (72.1%) and many were hospitalized in Los Angeles County (44.7%). Men were more likely than women to have severe disease including hydrocephalus (29.7% vs. 18.6%, p\u200a=\u200a0.027), resulting in longer hospitalizations (>4 days, 48.0% vs. 32.6%, p\u200a=\u200a0.007) that were more costly (charge>$40 thousand men\u200a=\u200a46.9% vs. woman\u200a=\u200a4.1%, p\u200a=\u200a0.026). Six deaths were recorded (2.0%). The total of NCC-related hospital charges exceeded $17 million; estimated hospital costs exceeded $5 million. Neurocysticercosis causes appreciable disease and exacts a considerable economic burden in California."
