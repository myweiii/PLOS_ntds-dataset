Interannual climate variability associated with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and regional climatic circulation mechanisms in the equatorial Indian Ocean result in significant rainfall and ecological anomaly patterns that are major drivers of spatial and temporal patterns of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. Correlation and regression analyses of long time series rainfall, vegetation index, and temperature data show that large scale anomalies occur periodically that may influence mosquito vector populations and thus spatial and temporal patterns of Rift Valley fever and chikungunya outbreaks. Rift Valley fever outbreak events occurred after a period of ∼3–4 months of persistent and above-normal rainfall that enabled vector habitats to flourish. On the other hand, chikungunya outbreaks occurred during periods of high temperatures and severe drought over East Africa and the western Indian Ocean islands. This is consistent with highly populated environmental settings where domestic and peri-domestic stored water containers were the likely mosquito sources. However, in Southeast Asia, approximately 52% of chikungunya outbreaks occurred during cooler-than-normal temperatures and were significantly negatively correlated with drought. Besides climate variability, other factors not accounted for such as vertebrate host immunity may contribute to spatio-temporal patterns of outbreaks.
