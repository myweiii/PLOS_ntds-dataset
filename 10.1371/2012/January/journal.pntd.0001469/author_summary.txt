Protozoan of the genus Leishmania undergo several developmental transitions during its life cycle. Leishmania alternates between two morphologically distinct forms, promastigotes (insect stage) and amastigotes (vertebrate stage). Most of the available information about Leishmania spp. has been obtained from studying in vitro cultured promastigotes, an excellent experimental model for the different developmental stages present in the insect vector. Although promastigotes are grown in a controlled environment, the maintenance of long term culture results in loss of virulence, which can lead to a misinterpretation and often contradictory experimental results. It is then of great interest to unravel the defects arising from sustained axenic parasite culture in laboratory settings. The authors demonstrate a correlation between the maintenance of parasite culture with a growing defect of the promastigote form to differentiate in the mammalian amastigote form. This research provides a biological explanation for the loss of virulence due to sustained parasite culture and discusses the impact for all experimental work done with visceral Leishmania species.
