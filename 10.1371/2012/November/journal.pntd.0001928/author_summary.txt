Dengue virus has been isolated from mosquitoes, non-human primates and humans in Senegalese jungles for the past 50 years. This sylvatic cycle shows unique transmission dynamics that are unexpected given previous theory and observation: First, the isolations appear to be synchronized across several host and vector species each with different natural histories of infection. Second, the periodicity of the isolations (time between outbreaks) is approximately eight years, much longer than the one or two year period observed in human endemic settings (e.g., Thailand, Brazil). In this paper we develop a multi-host, multi-vector differential equation model to test hypotheses that are potentially consistent with these observations. We find that coupling of separate primate-mosquito pairs through mosquito biting induces synchrony that is robust over a wide range of parameters. We also find that the eight year cycle is not robust to the inclusion of a constant introduction of infection, but is to a stochastic rate of introduction, and thus may be due to cycling of immunity among primates with long-period stochastic introductions. An accurate and thorough understanding of the sylvatic cycle of dengue may allow prediction of epidemics and lessen its impact on humans living in surrounding areas. This knowledge is especially important given the potential for these primate species to act as reservoirs for dengue in post-vaccination scenarios.
