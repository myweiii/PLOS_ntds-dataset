As the third most common mycobacterial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy, Buruli ulcer constitutes a considerable health problem in many parts of the world, but in particular in West and Central Africa. Although this emerging skin disease is commonly associated with proximity to aquatic habitats, the mode of transmission remains obscure. While the clonal population structure of Mycobacterium ulcerans provides a great potential to trace transmission pathways and evolutionary relationships, micro-epidemiological studies have long been hampered by a striking lack of genetic diversity among African M. ulcerans populations. Whole genome comparison of M. ulcerans strains isolated from patients living in the BU endemic Densu River Valley of Ghana led to the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms between these closely related strains. The subsequent development of SNP typing assays enabled a differentiation of ten M. ulcerans haplotypes in the BU endemic region. Here we selected canonical SNP markers for a spatio-temporal analysis of M. ulcerans variants in the Densu River Valley of Ghana using a temperature-switch PCR-based approach.
