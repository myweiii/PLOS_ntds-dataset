Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infectious disease caused by the environmental pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans that affects the skin, subcutaneous tissue and bone, presenting extensive tissue necrosis. Standard treatment of BU patients consists of a combination of the antibiotics rifampicin and streptomycin (RS) for 8 weeks. Histological analysis of biopsies taken from the lesions of treated patients reveals an augmented inflammation that is suggested to contribute to the antibiotics' efficacy. However, in some patients, this inflammatory process developed during RS treatment may cause disease worsening, the so-called paradoxical reactions. By using a mouse model of M. ulcerans footpad infection, we show that mice co-administered with RS and the immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone (DEX) are efficiently cured by the end of antibiotic treatment, although with a slight delay in bacterial clearance, pointing to a contribution of immune effector mechanisms. Additionally, no disease reactivation was observed after an additional period of 3 months of DEX administration. These findings have an important impact for the management of antibiotic-treated BU patients with paradoxical reactions, since the use of corticosteroids in mouse experimental infection do not cause treatment failure or disease reactivation, and therefore represents a potential strategy to control exacerbated immune responses during BU antibiotic treatment.
