While the majority of patients who exhibit febrile dengue infection recover within a week, a small proportion of the patients progress to develop severe symptoms that can be life-threatening if not managed in a hospital setting. Because there is no method to accurately identify this subgroup of patients, many dengue patients are hospitalized unnecessarily, which causes significant burden to the healthcare system. In our study, we have systematically measured a large number of molecules including cytokines and serum proteins in blood samples from a dengue patient cohort using highly sensitive mass spectrometry-based methods. We have further developed novel statistical methods that allow us to identify small panels of measureable blood markers, which can distinguish dengue patients that develop milder, self-limiting form of the disease from those that progress to develop severe symptoms. Because these markers can be applied within 48â€“72 hours of onset of febrile symptoms, we expect them to be useful for early classification of severe dengue disease.
