Chagas disease, an infectious disease endemic to Latin America, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. T. cruzi can be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ transplants, or from mother to fetus, although it is most commonly transmitted through insect vectors. Infections can remain silent for many years before manifesting as potentially fatal damage to the cardiac and/or digestive system. Diagnosis of Chagas disease during its chronic asymptomatic phase is crucial to preventing future infections with T. cruzi and is often performed using serological tests that detect antibodies in the blood. Because there is currently no gold standard for serological diagnostic tests, multiple forms of serologic testing are often used in conjunction. The purpose of this study was to compare reports on the accuracy of serological tests. After limiting studies by certain criteria, the authors found a lower estimate of accuracy than has previously been reported in the literature and suggest quality improvements that can be made to standardize future reports.
