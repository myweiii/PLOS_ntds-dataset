We conducted a systematic review of the English and French language literature indexed in PubMed between January 1970 and December 2011. Our objective was to identify which diagnostic tests are most suitable for diagnosis of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in first line health services in endemic countries. Tests were rated according to the “ASSURED” criteria, which put emphasis not only on diagnostic accuracy but also on user-friendliness and feasibility under field conditions. Diagnosis of HAT is a two-stage process in which a screening test is followed by a diagnostic confirmation test. Our search retrieved 16 different screening and diagnostic confirmation methods. The thermostable format of the CATT test came out as the most suitable screening test at health center level. It might be replaced by a lateral flow test that is currently being validated. Diagnostic confirmation tests currently available are cumbersome, technically demanding and have inadequate sensitivity; they rely on visualizing the parasite by microscopy. Without specific training and supervision, none of these tests can readily be used at health center level. Novel applications of molecular tests have the potential to replace the current diagnostic confirmation tests at district hospital level but they first need to be validated.
