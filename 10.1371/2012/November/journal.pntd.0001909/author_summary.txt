Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) has been included in such diseases neglected since this impact on public health have not been measured. Except in the South and Southeast of Brazil, there are no government programs for this mycosis. After 100 years of discovery of the disease there is the need to deploy an effective and continuous program for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment. PCM requires a prolonged treatment, generally greater than 1 year. Moreover, the patients with PCM are associated with other co morbidities such as alcoholism, smoking and malnutrition.
â€ƒTo aggravate this scenario the serological diagnosis of PCM in many cases results in cross reactivity with other mycoses. Thus, this study aimed to develop a PCR which can be used in association with the serological techniques to improve the diagnostic these individuals. We work with plasma samples from patients in northeastern Brazil, in an area where the disease has not been reported. None of the 76 plasma samples were positive by PCR, but a biopsy specimen obtained from a patient was positive. These results reinforce that PCR have the limitation when serum or plasma is used. However, PCR can be an important diagnostic tool when conventional diagnostic methods are not successful.
