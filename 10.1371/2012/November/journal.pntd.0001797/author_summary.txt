Additional tools are required to mitigate mosquito borne disease in the South Pacific, including human lymphatic filariasis (LF). Wolbachia are obligate intracellular bacteria that occur in a majority of insect species and that cause a form of conditional sterility in mosquitoes. Prior work demonstrates that male Aedes polynesiensis mosquitoes, which are artificially infected with Wolbachia (i.e., transinfected) can effectively sterilize wild type females in the laboratory, suggesting the potential applied use of Wolbachia as a pesticide for this medically important mosquito. As a critical intermediate step toward the development of the Wolbachia pesticide approach, we report on the field competitiveness of transinfected males and the risk of accidental horizontal transmission of Wolbachia from transinfected males. The outcome of laboratory cage trials and a thirty-week open release field trial provide evidence against horizontal transmission of Wolbachia from the transinfected males. Additionally, the field trial provides evidence for the competitiveness of transinfected males for indigenous female mates, as indicated by the failure of brood hatch and a resulting population level impact. No residual Wolbachia was detected in the targeted population during or after the male releases, showing released males to be ‘dead end hosts’ for Wolbachia. We discuss the results in relation to a disease control approach that integrates vector control with existing measures against LF.
