Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae), is a chronic infection leading to potentially debilitating nerve damage. Although the infection is curable with multi-drug therapy, many patients continue to suffer from episodes of inflammation, called Type 1 reactions. These reactions may lead to nerve damage and deformation. Patients with Type 1 reactions are treated with corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation. Elucidating the immune factors contributing to leprosy Type 1 reactions will further clarify why many leprosy patients develop nerve and skin inflammation. We conducted a study to understand whether the antimicrobial peptides, human beta-defensins (hBD) 2 and 3, are increased in the skin of leprosy patients with Type 1 reactions. We also investigated keratinocyte expression of hBD2 and hBD3 in response to M. leprae. In this study, we found that hBD3 was significantly increased in the skin of leprosy patients with Type 1 reactions. Moreover, we demonstrated that corticosteroid treatment reduced the expression of hBD3 in patients with Type 1 reactions. We also found that keratinocytes incubated with M. leprae upregulated hBD2 and hBD3 in vitro; corticosteroids were found to suppress this response. These studies suggest a role for the innate immune system in leprosy Type 1 reactions.
