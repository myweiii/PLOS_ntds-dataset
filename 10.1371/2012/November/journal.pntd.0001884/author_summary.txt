Understanding how host species influence vector-borne pathogen transmission in anthropogenically disturbed landscapes is important to predicting and preventing disease transmission. This study evaluates how host diversity, anthropogenic land use change, and host life history influence vector- borne multihost pathogen transmission in Panama, where the triatomine bug Rhodnius pallescens is the principal vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, agent of Chagas disease. We hypothesize that blood meal species composition and vector infection differ as a function of habitat disturbance, and that the host species intrinsic rate of increase is positively associated with T. cruzi vector infection. We collected R. pallescens across a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Blood meal species composition and T. cruzi vector infection were determined by molecular methods. Vector infection rates were higher in deforested habitats and forest fragments as compared to contiguous forests. Vectors fed primarily on mammals, likely accounting for a relatively high vector infection prevalence, and that host blood meal species composition varied across habitat types. Regression tree analysis demonstrates that higher T. cruzi vector infection indices we associated with sites that had blood meal species with higher, more variable, and more skewed rmax (intrinsic rates of increase) values, lower blood meal species diversity, and disturbed habitats, namely fragmented forests and peridomiciliary sites.
