Schistosomiasis japonica, a chronic human parasitic disease in the People's Republic of China, the Philippines and areas of Indonesia, is a zoonosis with over 40 different mammals, including a number of ruminants, that can act as reservoir hosts for the infection. Precise identification of the major infection reservoirs is important for the control of Schistosoma japonicum as their targeted treatment can prevent environmental contamination and transmission of the parasite, thus reducing the risk to humans. Current copro-parasitological techniques are generally unsatisfactory for identifying and quantifying S. japonicum eggs in ruminant feces due to the large volume of cellulosic debris present. The new approach we describe here, the FEAâ€“SD technique, removes much of this material by sieving and centrifugation with ethyl actate and renders any remaining debris transparent by use of a potassium hydroxide (KOH) digestion, providing much improved visualization of eggs, enabling the collection of more accurate data on S. japonicum infection in ruminants. This new tool will be of particular value for monitoring schistosome prevalence and intensity in animal reservoirs in areas of the People's Republic of China that are heading toward schistosomiasis elimination.
