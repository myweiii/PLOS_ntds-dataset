Schistosomiasis is a chronic, debilitating disease that affects over 200 million people globally. The pathology associated with schistosomiasis is caused by host immune responses to parasite eggs. Therefore, it is imperative to identify pathways responsible for controlling worm reproductive biology. Schistosome females must be in constant contact with male parasites in order to achieve reproductive maturity. The process of pairing and reproductive maturation in female worms is poorly understood, in part, because it does not occur outside of the host. In addition, when female schistosomes are removed from their mammalian host they regress to an immature state. In this study our goal was to characterize a unique set of genes in Schistosoma mansoni whose transcript abundance differs in mature and immature female worms. We found that the genes with higher transcript abundance in sexually mature female worms were expressed in female reproductive tissues, while those transcripts enriched in sexually immature worms were present in sub-surface somatic cells. Transcript abundance of the selected genes changed dramatically when females were removed from their host. These findings inform new approaches to study female worm biology and will provide insights into the processes of worm pairing and reproductive maturation.
