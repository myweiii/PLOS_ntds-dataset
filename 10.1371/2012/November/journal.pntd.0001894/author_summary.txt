Schistosomiasis is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases and an effective control is unlikely in the absence of improved sanitation and vaccine. The selection of a suitable delivery system and an adjuvant to aid in the stimulation of the appropriate immune response is a critical step in the path to the development and employment of successful anti-schistosome vaccines. Here we propose a candidate vaccine based on chitosan nanoparticles associated with the antigen SmRho and coated with alginate, as an alternative strategy to induce protection against S. mansoni infection. This vaccination strategy offers many technical advantages, including the possibility of administration by oral route, which makes the vaccine safer than injectable vaccines and facilitates its use mainly in underdeveloped areas. Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared and characterized; the results showed that the formulation has features suitable to be delivery orally. Immunization studies suggest that the combination of chitosan nanoparticles associated to the antigen SmRho and CpG is an efficient vaccine candidate against schistosomiasis, which was able to modulate the granuloma area, that represents the major pathological response in schistosomiasis and also to induce protection against infection of S. mansoni.
