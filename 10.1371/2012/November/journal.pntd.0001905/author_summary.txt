Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of major (re)-emerging human arboviruses, such as Dengue and Chikungunya. In absence of effective treatment and vaccine, the evaluation of human exposure to vector bites is crucial to estimate the risk of the viruses' transmission. Currently, exposure to Aedes aegypti bites is mainly evaluated by entomological methods which are indirect and fastidious to apply on a large scale. Human antibody (Ab) responses to arthropod salivary proteins were shown as a useful indicator of exposure to arthropod vector bites. Nevertheless, the whole saliva could not be a specific tool because some families of salivary proteins are common between many arthropod vectors. To develop a specific biomarker of exposure to Aedes aegypti bites, we assessed the evolution of IgG Ab response to Ae. aegypti Nterm-34 kDa salivary peptide in exposed children. The results indicate that children exposed to the bites of Ae. aegypti could develop specific Ab response to Nterm-34 kDa salivary peptide. This specific IgG response presented high inter-individual heterogeneity and increased significantly during the Ae. aegypti exposure season. Taken together, these preliminary results suggest that Ab responses to Nterm-34 kDa salivary could constitute a relevant immuno-epidemiological indicator for evaluating human exposure to the Ae. aegypti vector and by consequence the risk of arbovirus transmission.
