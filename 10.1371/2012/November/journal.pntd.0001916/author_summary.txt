Opistorchis viverrini is an important and neglected parasite affecting âˆ¼9 million people in South-east Asia. The parasite has a complex life-cycle which involves an intermediate phase in cyprinoid fishes. Consumption of raw or under-cooked fish infected with the metacercarial (larval) stage of O. viverreni results in infection, with adult worms living primarily in the intra-hepatic bile duct. In addition to the affects of the infection itself, O. viverrini is directly carcinogenic, with up to 70% of infected individuals in endemic regions developing malignant cholangiocarcinomas. Control of the parasite relies exclusively on the use of praziquantel and little is known about the mechanisms through which O. viverrini stimulates carcinogenesis. An improved understanding of the molecular biology of O. viverrini is urgently needed. In our study, we employed RNAseq technology to assess changes in gene transcription during the development of O. viverrini within the definitive host, and significantly improved the characterization of the transcriptome of this parasite. In so doing, we shed new light on the evolution of a major group proteins (i.e., the cysteine peptidases) which, given their important function roles as excreted/secreted molecules, have been proposed as attractive drug/vaccine targets for a wide-range of neglected flukes, including species of Opistorchis, Clonorchis, Schistosoma and Fasciola.
