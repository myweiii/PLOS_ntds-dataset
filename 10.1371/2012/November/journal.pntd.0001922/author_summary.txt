Schistosomes are parasitic worms that cause chronic and potentially deadly disease in millions of people in (sub)tropical areas. An important partial immunity to infection does develop but this takes many years of exposure and multiple infections. Therefore, children are far more susceptible to re-infection after treatment than adults. This immunological protection is associated with specific antibody and T cell responses. Many antibodies generated during Schistosoma infection are directed against carbohydrate chains (glycans) expressed by the parasite. The nature of the glycan epitopes recognized by antibodies in natural schistosomiasis infection serum is largely unknown. We have used a so-called shotgun glycan microarray approach to study differences in anti-glycan antibody responses between S. mansoni-infected children and adults. This resulted in the identification of differential glycan recognition profiles characteristic for the two different age groups that may reflect differences in age or differences in length of exposure or infection in people living in an endemic area.
