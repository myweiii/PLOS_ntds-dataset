Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection showing a surprising potential for geographic expansion. Similar to other tropical infectious diseases having no vaccine and no specific treatment, the main control strategy for Chikungunya remains reduction of mosquito population size. We developed a model for disease introduction that combines a climate based mosquito population dynamics stochastic model with an epidemiological model in order to identify temporal windows during which disease introduction through one exposed individual might compromise the health status of the entire human population. We ran this model with temperature data from different locations showing the geographic sensitivity of this risk. The identification of temporal windows with epidemic risk at different spatial locations is key to guiding mosquito population control campaigns. Locations with marked seasonal variation also have a season with high epidemic risk matching the period in which mosquito populations survive and grow, therefore controlling mosquito population sizes might be an optimal strategy in those areas. However, locations with other temperature patterns may need additional control strategies to avoid epidemics. To our knowledge, this is the first model to explore Chikungunya introduction in the USA. Our modeling approach can be used for other vector borne diseases and can be expanded to compare the outcome with different control strategies.
