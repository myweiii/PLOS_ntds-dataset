Tick-borne relapsing fever is a spirochete-caused, recurrent illness acquired by the bite of fast-feeding ticks. In Mali, the potential for people to acquire relapsing fever is unknown although a few human cases have been reported there. Human malaria is also abundant in Mali, and could be complicating the diagnosis of relapsing fever. The relapsing fever spirochete, Borrelia crocidurae, is maintained in natural cycles involving small mammals and its tick vector Ornithodoros sonrai. Therefore, we investigated 20 villages across southern Mali to determine if relapsing fever spirochetes were circulating in small mammals and ticks that lived with people. We found that 11.3% of the 726 mammals tested showed evidence of prior infection, while 2.2% of the animals were actively infected. The tick vector was abundant in two villages we sampled, and overall 17.3% of the individual ticks tested were infected with spirochetes. We also isolated the spirochetes, Borrelia crocidurae, from rodents and ticks and compared their genetic makeup to other species of African spirochetes. We conclude that in some areas of Mali, people are at risk of acquiring tick-borne relapsing fever. Therefore, we recommend that blood smears from acutely ill patients be examined microscopically for spirochetes.
