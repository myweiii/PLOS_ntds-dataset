Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a disease caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus that affects both humans and animals. In the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA), the livelihoods of millions of people depend on livestock and herding dogs. At the same time, poor animal slaughter practices still exist in the area. Therefore, the GHA is considered a textbook example for the transmission of E. granulosus. Nevertheless, although the World Health Organization (WHO) prioritized CE as one of the seven neglected zoonotic tropical diseases, a recent summary on the true extent to which the tapeworm occurs across the different host species in the GHA, and the factors that contribute to its transmission is missing. Our systematic review of the literature on the topic confirms that the tapeworm is widely spread in the GHA. At the same time, it remains difficult to accurately assess the occurrence of the worm and how exactly it spreads between the hosts, in absence of well-designed surveys. Based on the nature of the disease (involving both animals and humans) and the disease being highly prevalent in pastoralist communities that move across national borders, a firm response to control CE will require both interdisciplinary and transboundary partnerships.
