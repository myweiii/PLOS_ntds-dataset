Hepatitis E virus can cause large, protracted outbreaks in populations with limited access to safe water and sanitation. Hepatitis E infection is particularly dangerous for pregnant women in their third trimester. A vaccine, Hecolin, exists but it was never used in outbreak response despite a recommendation from the World Health Organization. In 2022, the Ministry of Health of South Sudan and Médecins Sans Frontières used the vaccine during an outbreak for the first time in an internally displaced persons camp with more than 100,000 people. We report on the results of the vaccination campaign, which show a high uptake of the vaccine and no serious side effects. We show that a vaccination campaign with Hecolin during an outbreak can reach many people at risk and is well tolerated. This will hopefully inspire confidence to use this vaccine again in the future.
