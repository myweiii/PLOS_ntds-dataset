Malaria, an infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, continues to affect millions of people each year. These parasites are transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes during blood feeding, which is required by females to produce eggs. After they are ingested by the female, parasites start developing in the midgut at the same time as the mosquito initiates oogenesis, the process of egg development. Here, we investigated how the concomitant processes of egg and parasite development interact in field-derived Anopheles and Plasmodium isolates. We found that in these naturally occurring pairs, oogenesis is negatively linked to parasite development, such that mosquitoes producing fewer eggs harbor faster growing oocysts. Furthermore, when we disrupt signaling pathways that drive oogenesis, oocyst growth is accelerated in a manner that appears to depend on both mosquito and parasite genotype. Additionally, when field mosquitoes fail to develop eggs, they are likely to have faster growing oocysts. The interaction between key mosquito and parasite developmental processes revealed here underscores how intimately linked Plasmodium are to mosquito physiology and can help inform the development of future vector control tools that are both safe and effective.
