In order to enhance the provision of healthcare for individuals afflicted with CL in rural Sri Lanka, it is imperative to delve into the consequences of the disease beyond its physical manifestations. Our research methodology encompassed a diverse array of approaches, including participant observation, diaries maintained by community researchers with subsequent interviews, and a Participant Experience Reflection Journal (PERJ) to gain insights into the experiences of community members affected by CL. After conducting thematic analysis of all the data sets, we identified three categories of burden that were interconnected with individuals’ perceptions and encounters with the disease: Wound-related burden, Treatment-related burden and Illness-experience-related burden. People with CL were found to experience fear, disgust, and concerns related to body image stemming from the visible wounds and faced adverse societal reactions due to their disease. The treatment regimen for CL posed various challenges for patients, such as disruption of their daily lives and physical discomfort. The experience of illness became more burdensome due to anxiety/worry concerning the illness’s severity, coupled with negative emotions linked to the disease. Prioritising the psychosocial burden associated with CL is essential for healthcare seeking, compliance, and disease control. We propose a context-specific, people-centred model to improve patient outcomes.
