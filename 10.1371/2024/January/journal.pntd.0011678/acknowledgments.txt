We would particularly like to thank the enthusiastic participation of the Samburu county participants and their communities in our survey. We also thank the support and approval of our study by the national and Samburu County Ministries of Health, especially Dr Sultani Matendechero who has championed snakebite and the plight of snakebite victims at the highest levels of government. We greatly appreciate the valuable contributions of other members of K-SRIC and Locate IT to this study, including Dr Hastings Ozwara, the former Director of IPR, whose efforts contributed to the conduct of this study.
