Contemporary reliable estimates of the number of cases and risk factors for snakebite are needed to inform interventions to reduce snakebite incidence, especially in countries with a high burden. We conducted a community-based study in Samburu County Kenya, using methods enabling the inclusion of mobile pastoralist communities that are hard-to-reach. Of the 3610 participants recruited into our study, 2.2% (95% CI 1.4%–3.4%) had experienced a snakebite in the past five years, and there were 138 (95% CI 44–322) deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Snakebites were most common during the dry season and most victims were bitten when they were sleeping or walking/playing outdoors, usually at night. Living in a wealthier household or in a household with more inhabitants lowered the risk of a snakebite. Snakebite prevention interventions in Samburu County should consider the higher number of bites during the dry season and at night. Health facilities may need to ensure 24-hour availability of both antivenom treatment and of expertise in the management of snakebite.
