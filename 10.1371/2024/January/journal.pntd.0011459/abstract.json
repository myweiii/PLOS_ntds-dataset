    "Abstract": "Orthoflavivirus japonicum (JEV) is the dominant cause of viral encephalitis in the Asian region with 100,000 cases and 25,000 deaths reported annually. The genome is comprised of a single polyprotein that encodes three structural and seven non-structural proteins. We collated a dataset of 349 complete genomes from a number of public databases, and analysed the data for recombination, evolutionary selection and phylogenetic structure. There are low rates of recombination in JEV, subsequently recombination is not a major evolutionary force shaping JEV. We found a strong overall signal of purifying selection in the genome, which is the main force affecting the evolutionary dynamics in JEV. There are also a small number of genomic sites under episodic diversifying selection, especially in the envelope protein and non-structural proteins 3 and 5. Overall, these results support previous analyses of JEV evolutionary genomics and provide additional insight into the evolutionary processes shaping the distribution and adaptation of this important pathogenic arbovirus."
