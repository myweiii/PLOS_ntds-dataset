In recent years, Acanthamoeba spp. have become an increasingly important human pathogen, causing serious, debilitating, and sometimes deadly infections. It can cause a rare but severe and potentially blinding corneal infection known as Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), which is extremely painful, difficult to diagnose, and treat. In a remarkable dual role, Acanthamoeba species act as phagocytic predator, consuming other microbes, but also as environmental hosts for a wide range of bacteria. With the increasing prevalence of coinfections among AK patients, which often lead to the severe outcomes, it is important to identify the intracellular bacteria hosted by Acanthamoeba spp. Using a series of experiments we confirmed the presence of intracellular P. aeruginosa in an Acanthamoeba strain isolated from AK patient domestic tap water. Our findings showed that amoeba adapted P. aeruginosa exhibited enhanced intracellular survival and replication in human monocyte derived macrophages (hMDMs) compared to the wildâ€“type strain PAO1. Here, for the first time, we investigated the role of naturally acquired viable intracellular P. aeruginosa in the development of Acanthamoeba keratitis in rats. The presence of intracellular bacteria in Acanthamoeba resulted into acute keratitis, highlighting the importance of identifying endosymbionts harbored by Acanthamoeba for accurate differential diagnostics and prognostic evaluations of Acanthamoeba keratitis.
