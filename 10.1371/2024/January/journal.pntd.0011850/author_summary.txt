Emergomyces africanus is a thermally-dimorphic fungus that was recently described as the cause of disseminated infections in persons living with advanced HIV disease in South Africa, where emergomycosis is among the most frequently diagnosed dimorphic fungal diseases. Four additional Emergomyces species have been described causing serious infections around the world, and the infection has a high case fatality rate. Despite the seriousness of this infection, the pathophysiology, immunology, diagnosis, and optimal management of emergomycosis remain largely unknown, hampered by the absence of an animal model. Here, we established a mouse model of pulmonary and disseminated emergomycosis using a clinical isolate of E. africanus with the aim of investigating the host immune response. We found that infection spread from the lungs to other organs within two weeks. We describe the effector immune responses in immune-competent mice aiding in controlled infection. We also highlight the immune-modulating components lacking in immunocompromised mice that promote susceptibilty to infection. Our study provides new insights into the components of the host immune response required for controlling Emergomyces spp. infection.
