Tuberculosis is a major health problem, particularly in developing countries. Globally efforts are being made to control this disease. However, the emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is a major threat to the tuberculosis control program. Moreover, the available methods for the detection of tuberculosis and susceptibility testing are time-consuming and labour-intensive. All these methods require pre-culture before drug susceptibility testing hence the turnaround time is prolonged. The microscopic observation drug susceptibility method is a liquid-based culture method which simultaneously detects tuberculosis and its susceptibility.
Originally developed microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay is done in 24 well tissue culture plates, but problems of false positivity which likely represent cross-contamination from another positive specimen or positive controls plated on each MODS plate is the limitation of this assay. This method also poses the risk of exposure to infection to the person performing the assay. To overcome these issues, in the present study, we introduced modified MODS using screw-capped tissue culture bottles instead of tissue culture plates. The advantage of this modification is that samples and controls are processed in separate bottles which are screw-caped hence reducing chances of cross-contamination and risk of exposure to infection. The mutational pattern of drug-resistant strains is not known in this region. GenoType MTBDRplus assay was performed to detect the resistance and mutational pattern associated with the resistances.
