Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a serious parasitic disease that may lead to death within 10â€“15 years after diagnosis if untreated. It is caused by larval stages of the fox tapeworm, Echinococcus multilocularis, which predominantly circulates in the sylvatic cycle, with carnivores (foxes, raccoon dogs, jackals, wolves) as definitive hosts and small mammals as intermediate hosts. Human infection occurs after the accidental ingestion of infective parasite eggs. The liver is the most often affected organ, and the parasite shows features similar to malignant tumors with invasive and infiltrative growth and metastasis formation. Here we present current epidemiological data on human alveolar echinococcosis in Slovakia and compare the geographical distribution of AE cases with occurrence of parasite in red foxes. Moreover, the genetic diversity of E. multilocularis is not yet fully understood, and it is supposed that even subtle genetic differences may have relevance for variation in infectivity for humans. Therefore, we addressed the question of distribution of E. multilocularis haplotypes in clinical isolates across the country and investigated their genetic relatedness with haplotypes in other countries of Europe.
