Onchocerciasis is a severely debilitating disease caused by infection with a parasitic nematode worm (Onchocerca volvulus) transmitted from person to person by blood-sucking blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae). Ethiopia has set a goal to eliminate the transmission of onchocerciasis through administration of the drug ivermectin, with 80% coverage, to all endemic areas. One potential challenge that might impede elimination in Ethiopia (and elsewhere in Africa) is the movement of vector blackflies carrying parasites between endemic areas, leading to failure to eliminate transmission. Cytogenetic data are the primary means for delimiting vector species, and we report the detection of a new cytotaxonomic form in northwestern Ethiopia, the “Gondar form” of Simulium damnosum s.l. Comparisons of nuclear genetic diversity of vectors in northwest Ethiopia suggests genetic differentiation consistent with reduction in mating between flies from two foci of ongoing transmission–Metema and Metekel. These results further suggest movement of blackflies is likely from Metekel, an area with ongoing transmission, into Metema, an area where persistent hotspots of transmission have been recently identified. Further research is warranted to determine whether the migration of blackflies between these areas that results in the observed genetic similarity is occurring at a timescale epidemiologically relevant to the persistence of these transmission hotspots.
