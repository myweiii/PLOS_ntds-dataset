Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are an umbrella term for 20 diseases and disease groups recognized by the World Health Organization. Although NTDs are usually considered to be a public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, people living in high-income countries could also be affected. In this scoping review, we aimed to summarize the latest evidence and information to understand the epidemiology of and public health response to NTDs in Japan. Japan officially reported a yearly average of 340 NTD cases between 2014 and 2017; however, we found that it does not accurately reflect the current status of NTDs in the country. Our review suggests that 15 of 20 NTDs can be considered to be important public health concerns. While echinococcosis, chikungunya, dengue, and rabies are under control by law, many other NTDs are largely neglected by Japanâ€™s health systems and solely addressed by a limited number of physicians and researchers. We recommend that the Government of Japan should assume responsibility for enhancing surveillance, expanding access to diagnostics and medicines, and ensuring affordability of unapproved NTD drugs.
