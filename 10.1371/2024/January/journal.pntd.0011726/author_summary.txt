Mycetoma primarily affects low-income people in limited-resource communities in tropical and subtropical regions. The affected mycetoma are of low socioeconomic and health education status, and their localities’ health and medical facilities are frequently inadequate. Hence, they present with massive, complicated disease; thus, the treatment outcome is suboptimal. Mycetoma has many disabilities and psychosocial effects, which may affect the patient nutritional status. Furthermore, most of the mycetoma epidemiological risk factors are indistinct and unclear. With this background, this study was conducted to determine the effect of the disease on the patients’ nutritional status and to determine if nutrition has a role in mycetoma susceptibility. The study included 179 patients with confirmed mycetoma and age and sex-matched 179 controls from their communities. The mean patients’ height was 160±14.31cm, and for the control was 166.78±10.97 cm. The patients’ body weight mean was 56.09±17.67kg; for the control, it was 67.53±16.41kg, and no statistically significant differences existed. The body mass index showed a higher percentage of underweight individuals in the patients group, which was statistically significant. No significant correlations existed between the study population BMI groups and their demographic characteristics. There were many similarities between the studied patients and the control regarding the dietary habits and diet intake. More in-depth studies are needed to determine the causal and effect relationship between mycetoma and the affected population. Nutritional support and education, while encouraging intake of therapeutic/functional locally available food items, should be fundamental in the different mycetoma management activities and measurements.
