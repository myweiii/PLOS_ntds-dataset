    "Background": "Loa loa filariasis (loiasis) is still considered a relatively benign disease. However, recent epidemiologic data suggest increased mortality and morbidity in L. loa infected individuals. We aimed to examine whether the density of L. loa microfilariae (mfs) in the blood is associated with cardiovascular disease.",
    "Methodology": "Using a point-of-care device (pOpm\u00e8tre), we conducted a cross-sectional study to assess arterial stiffness and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in 991 individuals living in a loiasis-endemic rural area in the Republic of the Congo. Microfilaremic individuals were matched for age, sex and village of residence with 2 amicrofilaremic subjects.",
    "Principal findings": "Among the individuals included in the analysis, 192/982 (19.5%) and 137/976 (14.0%) had a PWV or an ABI considered out of range, respectively. Out of range PWV was associated with younger age, high mean arterial pressure and high L. loa MFD. Compared to amicrofilaremic subjects, those with more than 10,000 mfs/mL were 2.17 times more likely to have an out of range PWV (p = 0.00). Factors significantly associated with PAD were older age, low pulse rate, low body mass index, smoking, and L. loa microfilaremia. Factors significantly associated with an elevation of PP were older age, female sex, high average blood pressure, low pulse rate and L. loa microfilaremia.",
    "Conclusion": "A potential link between high L. loa microfilaremia and cardiovascular health deterioration is suggested. Further studies are required to confirm and explore this association."
