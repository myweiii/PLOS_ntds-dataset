Recent epidemiologic data suggested an increased mortality and morbidity in individuals harboring high densities of Loa loa microfilariae in the blood, underscoring the importance of studies on the possible reasons for this excess mortality. This cross-sectional study assessed arterial stiffness and cardiovascular health markers using a point-of-care device (pOpm√®tre) among 991 sex-, age- and residency-matched individuals living in rural forested areas of Congo. Analyses included known cardiovascular risk factors (body mass index, smoking, blood pressure, creatininemia) and parasitological covariates (onchocerciasis, asymptomatic malaria, soil-transmitted helminths and Loa loa microfilaremia). People with microfilaremia were more likely to have levels of cardiovascular markers indicating arterial stiffness and deteriorated cardiovascular health, compared with those without microfilaremia.
