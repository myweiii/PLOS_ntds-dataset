Snakebite envenomings cause important tropical human diseases that often include a lethal muscle paralysis. Current treatments consist in hospitalization and antivenoms, which are not always quickly accessible to victims. In fact, these snakebites take place mainly in rural and low-income countries.
In this work, researchers discovered, in mice, a novel function of melatonin and of its type 1 receptor in promoting functional recovery after snake-induced peripheral neuroparalysis with nerve terminal degeneration. In particular, researchers found that drugs approved for the treatment of insomnia (Ramelteon) and depression (Agomelatine), activate melatonin receptor and promote the functional recovery after a krait venom induced paralysis.
These drugs are on sell in pharmacies, are safe and stable, and are ready to be tried for promoting the recovery from peripheral neuroparalysis in human victims bitten by neurotoxic snakes, even without hospitalization.
