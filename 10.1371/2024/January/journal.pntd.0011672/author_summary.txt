Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in Panama, caused by Choclo virus (CHOV, Orthohantavirus chocloense), is intimately linked to the primary mammalian reservoir host, the Costa Rican pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys costaricensis). Although the prevalence of hantavirus disease is relatively low in Panama, over a quarter of the country has the agroecological conditions that favor this rodent. In addition, serologic evidence suggests infections are under-reported. Sequence data of the pathogen and host collected across temporal and spatial scales is necessary for diagnostics, surveillance, and forecasting; however, only one complete genome is available in NCBI GenBank. By leveraging deep metatranscriptomics of archived frozen mammal tissues, we generated a low-coverage genome using a reference-guided assembly approach. Sequence data can be used to develop pan-hantavirus diagnostic tools to facilitate acquisition of more detailed genetic data from archival samples to increase our understanding of the evolutionary and population dynamics of rare and neglected hantaviruses. This approach further illustrates the utility of cryopreserved biorepositories archived in natural history museums for pathogen discovery and pathobiology. Generating additional genomic sequence data will also be essential for developing a rigorous taxonomic framework to improve the understanding of hantavirus diversity and distribution.
