Plasmodium knowlesi is a parasite that can cause malaria when it infects humans. Although most people do not experience severe illness from Plasmodium knowlesi infection, a small number will develop serious or even fatal disease. The parasite is found naturally in some monkeys throughout Southeast Asia, and spreads from these monkeys to humans through mosquitoes. Previous research predicted where the risk of being infected is highest according to what we know about the environment across Southeast Asia, such as if there are forests in an area or if the altitude is high. In this work, we extend this previous research with more up-to-date data on environmental conditions and infections to predict the risk of being infected with Plasmodium knowlesi. We show that the risk Plasmodium knowlesi poses to humans is high across much of Southeast Asia, and that the disease will continue to challenge national goals to eliminate malaria.
