The factors driving the increasing burden of arboviruses like dengue virus are not fully understood. In this study, we measured changes in dengue virus transmission intensity and arbovirus disease risk across Ecuador, an ecologically and demographically diverse South American country. We found that differences in the distribution of dengue cases could be explained by changes in transmission of dengue virus over time: transmission was limited to coastal provinces with large cities between 1980â€“2000, expanding thereafter to higher elevation areas and ecologically suitable but previously geographically and socially isolated provinces. We also used species distribution mapping to show that both urban and rural areas in Ecuador are at medium to high risk for Aedes aegypti presence, with population size, trash removal, elevation, and access to water as strong predictors. Our investigation reveals changes driving the expansion of dengue virus and other arboviruses globally and provides an approach for identifying areas at early stages of establishing endemic transmission that should be targeted for intense preventative efforts to avert future epidemics.
