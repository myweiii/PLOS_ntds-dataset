Checklists have been developed and validated to improve patient safety and effectiveness of care in several fields, including emergency medicine, intensive care, and surgery. The Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) supplies antivenoms (AVs) to the health system at no cost to patients. AV access is thus limited to hospitals, most of which are in urban areas and difficult for rural, remote, and indigenous populations to reach. Currently, there is no evidence-based method to evaluate the capacity of health units for AV treatment, nor what the absolute minimum supplies and staff are necessary for safe and effective AV administration and clinical management. In this study, we aim to develop and validate a checklist to evaluate the minimum requirements for community health centers to adequately treat snakebite envenoming in the Amazon region of Brazil. This study joins an international set of evidence advocating for decentralization, adding value in its definition of essential care items, represented by Human Resources, and Equipment, Supplies and Medicines, to provide safe and effective treatment for SBE patients in remote endemic areas.
