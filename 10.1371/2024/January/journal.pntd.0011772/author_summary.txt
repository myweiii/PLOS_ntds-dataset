Research suggests that many contextual factors affect the success of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns, yet detailed descriptions of implementation is absent from existing literature. We applied process mapping to describe and compare the flow of activities in MDA programs for soil-transmitted helminths. This represents the first known use of process mapping in community-based campaigns in low resource settings. Process maps were updated annually over three implementation years to identify activities that were added or removed from the MDA process, and whether implementation occurred according to plans. Findings suggest that MDA processes vary widely, are regularly adapted, and deviations from plans often occurred for purposeful reasons. Process mapping may be valuable for microplanning of MDA campaigns because it can generate granular detail about planned activities across national, sub-national and local levels.
