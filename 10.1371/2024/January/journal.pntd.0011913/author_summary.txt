Chagas cardiomyopathy is a manifestation of end-organ damage from Trypanosoma cruzi parasitic infection. Most infections occur in Mexico, Central and South America but disease is present globally due to migration. Approximately 30% of those with Chagas disease develop cardiomyopathy years after infection from persistent heart muscle and conduction system inflammation, which can be life-threatening. Unfortunately, Chagas disease remains underdiagnosed and identifying those at risk for severe disease remains challenging. The 2018 American Heart Association guidelines recommend ECG and cardiac rhythm strip, but there is no consensus on the approach to further cardiac evaluation in the US or management of Chagas cardiomyopathy. This study retrospectively analyzed symptoms and cardiac examination of migrants predominantly from endemic Central American countries who were diagnosed with Chagas disease and received care at Boston Medical Center. Most patients were asymptomatic and nearly half had evidence of cardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram abnormalities were present in approximately one-third of asymptomatic individuals with normal ECGs. Some individuals had significant abnormalities found on heart rhythm monitors or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging which led to management changes. These findings underscore the importance of routine echocardiograms, consideration of cardiac rhythm monitoring, and thorough cardiac assessment in people with Chagas disease regardless of symptoms.
