    "Background": "Limited data exist regarding cardiac manifestations of Chagas disease in migrants living in non-endemic regions.",
    "Methods": "A retrospective cohort analysis of 109 patients with Chagas disease seen at Boston Medical Center (BMC) between January 2016 and January 2023 was performed. Patients were identified by screening and testing migrants from endemic regions at a community health center and BMC. Demographic, laboratory, and cardiac evaluation data were collected.",
    "Results": "Mean age of the 109 patients was 43 years (range 19\u201376); 61% were female. 79% (86/109) were diagnosed with Chagas disease via screening and 21% (23/109) were tested given symptoms or electrocardiogram abnormalities. Common symptoms included palpitations (25%, 27/109) and chest pain (17%, 18/109); 52% (57/109) were asymptomatic. Right bundle branch block (19%, 19/102), T-wave changes (18%, 18/102), and left anterior fascicular block (11%, 11/102) were the most common electrocardiogram abnormalities; 51% (52/102) had normal electrocardiograms. Cardiomyopathy stage was ascertained in 94 of 109 patients: 51% (48/94) were indeterminate stage A and 49% (46/94) had cardiac structural disease (stages B1-D). Clinical findings that required clinical intervention or change in management were found in 23% (25/109), and included cardiomyopathy, apical hypokinesis/aneurysm, stroke, atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, and apical thrombus.",
    "Conclusions": "These data show high rates of cardiac complications in a cohort of migrants living with Chagas disease in a non-endemic setting. We demonstrate that Chagas disease diagnosis prompts cardiac evaluation which often identifies actionable cardiac disease and provides opportunities for prevention and treatment."
