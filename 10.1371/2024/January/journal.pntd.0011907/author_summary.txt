The main objective of pre-erythrocytic (PE) vaccine development against Plasmodium vivax is to inhibit hepatocyte infection and the development of the hepatic parasite, thus limiting the subsequent invasion of red blood cells. Although immunization with irradiated sporozoites induces immune responses against the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), PE vaccines based on recombinant or synthetic CSP alone have not generated protective immunity. Investigating immune responses to sporozoite proteins which play a key role in PE development could help improve vaccine design strategies. Here, we assessed the prevalence, magnitude and longevity of antibody responses against several PE proteins in vivax malaria patients living in an area of low malaria transmission in Southern Thailand. This study provides evidence that antibody responses to surface, micronemal and traversal proteins of sporozoites developed during acute infection. Although the magnitude of IgG responses to all tested PE antigens declined with time, seropositivity to these antigens was maintained after infection. Future studies demonstrating functional activity of naturally-acquired antibodies against sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes would be invaluable to our understanding of anti-PE immunity and vaccine development.
