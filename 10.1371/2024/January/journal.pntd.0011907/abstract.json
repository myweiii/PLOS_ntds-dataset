    "Background": "P. vivax malaria is a major global health burden hindering social and economic development throughout many tropical and sub-tropical countries. Pre-erythrocytic (PE) vaccines emerge as an attractive approach for the control and elimination of malaria infection. Therefore, evaluating the magnitude, longevity and prevalence of naturally acquired IgG antibody responses against PE candidate antigens is useful for vaccine design.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "The antigenicity of five recombinant PE antigens (PvCSP-VK210, PvSSP3, PvM2-MAEBL, PvCelTOS and PvSPECT1) was evaluated in plasma samples from individuals residing in low transmission areas in Thailand (Ranong and Chumphon Provinces). The samples were collected at the time of acute vivax malaria and 90, 270 and 360 days later. The prevalence, magnitude and longevity of total IgG and IgG subclasses were determined for each antigen using the longitudinal data. Our results showed that seropositivity of all tested PE antigens was detected during infection in at least some subjects; anti-PvCSP-VK210 and anti-PvCelTOS antibodies were the most frequent. Titers of these antibodies declined during the year of follow up, but notably seropositivity persisted. Among seropositive subjects at post-infection, high number of subjects possessed antibodies against PvCSP-VK210. Anti-PvSSP3 antibody responses had the longest half-life. IgG subclass profiling showed that the predominant subclasses were IgG1 and IgG3 (cytophilic antibodies), tending to remain detectable for at least 360 days after infection.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The present study demonstrated the magnitude and longevity of serological responses to multiple PE antigens of P. vivax after natural infection. This knowledge could contribute to the design of an effective P. vivax vaccine."
