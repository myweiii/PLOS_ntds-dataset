Plasmodium vivax malaria is a neglected tropical disease, despite being more geographically widespread than any other form of malaria and causes 132â€“391 million clinical infections each year. The documentation of P. vivax infections in different parts of Africa where Duffy-negative individuals, who were previously thought to be immune to P. vivax malaria, are dominant suggested that there are alternative pathways for P. vivax to invade human erythrocytes. Experimental approaches to unveil parasite invasion ligands are greatly limited due to a lack of reliable long-term culturing techniques and thus remains largely unexplored. Findings of this study are the first to examine the transcriptomes of African P. vivax and compare such to other geographical isolates with the goal to provide an important baseline for future comparisons of P. vivax transcriptomes in Duffy-negative infections. Our analyses also highlight potential biomarkers for improved gametocyte detection to better monitor the spread of P. vivax malaria.
