Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne infectious disease caused by intracellular parasites and affects 12â€“15 million people worldwide. The clinical presentation is variable, and the disease mainly manifests as cutaneous, visceral or mucosal forms. We collected 340 cases of leishmaniasis occurring in Austria over a period of 21 years and performed an analysis of trends to understand the epidemiology of the disease in a non-endemic Central European country. In addition, we report a rare case of concurrent visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis which was vertically transmitted to an immunocompetent child. Our analyses revealed that the incidences of cutaneous leishmaniasis are rising in Austria and that a shift in the causative species spectrum has occurred. Due to increased population migration, travel activities of humans and animal hosts, growth and spread of the vector populations facilitated primarily by climate changes, a rising number of leishmaniasis cases can be anticipated in many endemic, but intriguingly also in non-endemic regions. The potential expansion of endemicity necessitates raising awareness towards the burden of this disease and provides an incentive to the global health community to continue their efforts in disease control.
