    "Introduction": "An estimated 350 million people worldwide are at risk of leishmaniasis. The disease is prevalent over vast geographical ranges and many countries, notably in eastern Africa, the Indian subcontinent, South America, Central Asia and the Mediterranean region. The Leishmania donovani complex (L. donovani and L. infantum) causes widespread fatal human visceral leishmaniasis (VL, kala-azar), which is the most devastating form of leishmaniasis, predominantly associated with vulnerable populations, and opportunistic in individuals compromised by HIV co-infection. Without effective treatment symptomatic VL is almost always fatal; around 50,000 to 90,000 cases occur annually [1]. As well as human VL, L. infantum is responsible for widespread canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). Furthermore, L. braziliensis of the American subgenus Viannia causes a severe destructive mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), with catastrophic invasion and destruction of the nasopharynx. The mechanisms by which Leishmania survive in infected asymptomatic carriers and then relapse opportunistically in immunocompromised individuals, are not fully understood. There are no proven human vaccines, and drugs and diagnostics require substantial improvement [2].\nThe taxonomy of Leishmania is complex. There are now four recognized subgenera, Leishmania, Viannia, Mundinia and Sauroleishmania [3]. The two subgenera Leishmania and Viannia include human parasites, each comprised of several species, which have different abilities to survive in sand fly species, and that have distinct distributions of developmental forms in the sand flies that are their associated vectors [4]. Molecular methods have allowed reassessment of Leishmania taxonomy, revealing that some named Leishmania species are invalid [5]. Historically, all Leishmania were considered to be fundamentally clonal. However, evidence accumulated of genetic exchange within and between natural populations of several Leishmania species, including those of Viannia, such as L. braziliensis and L. peruviana/guyanensis, and inbreeding has been detected in natural populations of both L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis [6]. Applying multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and microsatellite analysis (MLMT) revealed evidence of sympatric putative parents and hybrid progeny of L. donovani in an endemic focus of VL in Ethiopia, subsequently confirmed by detailed comparative genomics [7]. Genetic exchange has also been observed among other Leishmania populations, for example Leishmania tropica of the Middle East [8].\nExperimental genetic crosses of L. major were finally achieved in the sand fly vector, and progeny from geographically disparate sources of L. major were shown to be viable. The hybrids had genotypes consistent with classical meiosis. However, aneuploidy, recurrent triploidy and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were also observed [9,10]. More recently, genetic crosses of L. donovani, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis have been achieved in vitro, facilitated when the Leishmania were exposed to stress and DNA damage, with intraspecific hybridisation, although principally producing tetraploid hybrids [11\u201313]. Similarly, interspecies crosses between L. donovani and L. major, and L. donovani and L. tropica, have been achieved in vitro [14]. No distinct male or female gametes of Leishmania have yet been described, although haploid stages of the trypanosomatid Trypanosoma brucei have been discovered in tsetse flies [15].\nA range of sand fly species can now be grown in laboratory colonies, enabling great insight into the life cycles and natural genetics of Leishmania in the vector. Genetic exchange in Leishmania has profound epidemiological importance. It may lead to hybrid vigour (heterosis), with the emergence and spread of strains that are more virulent or are resistant to drugs, with adaptation to new insect vectors, hosts and ecological niches, with implications on the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic methods and efficacy of vaccine candidates.\nHere, we describe experimental genetic crosses of L. donovani in two sand fly species, Phlebotomus orientalis and Phlebotomus argentipes, and compare genomics of the parents and the progeny. We also consider the relevance of genetic diversity and genetic exchange on Leishmania diagnostic and vaccine candidates.",
    "Material and methods": "Sand fly colonies and parasites\nLaboratory colonies of four sand fly species, Phlebotomus orientalis (from Ethiopia), P. argentipes (India), Sergentomyia schwetzi (Ethiopia) and P. duboscqi (Senegal), were maintained in the insectary of the Charles University in Prague under standard conditions (at 26\u00b0C, fed on 50% sucrose,) with a 14 h light/10 h dark photoperiod as described previously [16]. The latter two sand fly species were included as non-permissive vector controls.\nLeishmania donovani Parent 1 (P1) (MHOM/ET/2010/GR347) expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) and L. donovani Parent 2 (P2) (MHOM/ET/2010/AM459) expressing red fluorescent protein (dsRFP), both strains originating from Ethiopia, were cultured in M199 medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (Gibson) supplemented by 1% BME vitamins (Sigma), 2% sterile human urine, 250 \u03bcg/ml amikacin (Amikin, Bristol-Myers Squibb), and 150 \u03bcg/ml selective antibiotic G 418 (Sigma) and Hygromycin B (Sigma), respectively [4,7]. To obtain amastigote stages, mouse macrophage line J774 was exposed to stationary-phase parasites at a parasite to macrophage ratio 8:1. Both infected and uninfected macrophages were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin, 2mM L-glutamine, and 0.05 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (all from Sigma) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\n\n\nSand fly infections\nAmastigote stages were obtained from co-cultivation with J774 cells for 72 h. Non-internalized parasites were removed by washing 3 times with preheated culture medium. Numbers of parasites per macrophages were counted using fluorescent microscopy. Infected macrophages were removed from the cultivation flasks, centrifuged at 200 g for 10 minutes, washed in saline solution and resuspended in heat-inactivated rabbit blood (Bioveta) for sand fly infections at the concentration of 2 \u00d7 106 amastigotes ml-1 for eGFP parasites and 5 \u00d7 106 amastigotes ml-1 for dsRFP parasites. Different concentrations were used to account for different growth rates. Sand fly females were co-infected by feeding through a chicken skin membrane on a suspension of both Leishmania strains. Engorged females were separated and maintained in standard conditions, as described above. Females were dissected for subsequent analysis on days 2\u20133 and 7\u201310 post-blood meal (PBM) (i.e. before defecation of bloodmeal remnants and post defecation, respectively).\n\n\nRecovery of hybrid Leishmania from sand flies\nLive hybrids were recovered by cultivation in double drug selective medium: sand fly females were anesthetized on ice, sterilized in 70% ethanol and washed in sterile saline solution. Dissection was performed under semi-sterile conditions. Dissected midguts were inoculated into wells of microtitration plates containing 50 \u03bcl of M199 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibson), 1% BME vitamins (Sigma), 2% sterile urine, 250 \u03bcg/ml amikacin (Amikin, Bristol-Myers Squibb) and fluorocytosin (1.5 mg/ml). The selective antibiotics were both applied after 24 h of cultivation at a concentration of 200 \u03bcg/ml in a total volume 100 \u03bcl of media. After 7 days live promastigotes were sub-cultured into 1 ml of the medium with double selective antibiotics at a concentration of 150 \u03bcg/ml. Presence of the hybrids in cultures were checked by fluorescent microscopy and positive cultures were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for further characterisation of recovered parasites.\n\n\nFACS analysis\nAt different time intervals PBM, guts of infected sand flies were dissected into a small volume of saline solution (100 \u03bcl) and filtered using 30 \u03bcl filters (Partec) into a further 2 ml of saline solution. Putative hybrid cells were sorted with a BD Influx instrument (BD Biosciences) with the laser emitting at 488 nm wavelength for eGFP and 516 nm wavelength for dsRFP and detection of emission at 530/30 (eGFP positive events) and 585/29 nm (dsRFP positive events). The cytometer was calibrated using both a positive control (eGFP and dsRFP transfected lines of Leishmania) and a negative control (wild type Leishmania strain). Events showing double positive emission were collected into 384 well glass bottom plates with lid (In Vitro Scientific) with 50 \u03bcl of saline solution. After complete cell sorting, glass bottom plates with potential hybrid cells were rapidly vortexed and centrifuged (4000 rpm for 1 min) to concentrate cells on the bottom of the plates. Events showing double-positive emission were analysed using the Inverted fluorescence microscope Delta Vision Core (Life Sciences) to detect single cells co-expressing red and green fluorescence.\n\n\nMorphometry of hybrid Leishmania\nPhlebotomus argentipes females co-infected with both parental L. donovani strains were dissected at days 7\u20139 PBM and the midguts containing parasites were embedded into Vectashield HardSet Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector laboratories, USA) and examined under the Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope. Abdominal and thoracic parts of midguts were embedded and evaluated separately. The spectral characteristics of both eGFP and dsRFP tagged cells were examined using a GaAsP spectral detector separately and subsequent on-line unmixing was performed to distinguish between red and green forms in mixed populations. This approach more effectively separated throughput of eGFP and dsRFP signals. Imaging was performed in Nyquist resolution using tile scan function to cover a larger area using a Plan-Apochromat 25x/0.8 oil immersion objective. For high resolution 3D imaging a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 oil immersion objective was used. A 488 nm laser line for eGFP and 561 nm laser line for dsRFP were used in parallel as the excitation sources. Body length, flagellar length and body width of parasites were measured using Image-J software [17]. Three morphological forms were distinguished, according to Sadlova et al [18]: short promastigotes (SP, body length < 14 \u03bcm and flagellar length \u2a7dtwice body length), elongated nectomonads (EN, body length \u2265 14 \u03bcm) and metacyclic promastigotes (MP, body length < 14 \u03bcm and flagellar length >2 times body length). In total, 333 promastigotes were measured.\n\n\nCloning of hybrid Leishmania on solid media\nThree batches comprising a total of 19 hybrid cultures from 2 sand fly species (Phlebotomus orientalis and P. argentipes) were transferred to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (Table 1) and maintained in \u03b1-MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% inactivated foetal calf serum (FBS) and both selective antibiotics, each at 150 \u03bcg/ml and 25\u00b0C. For cloning cultures were grown on solid media agar plates of \u03b1-MEM, with 3% agar (Sigma), and both antibiotics, adapted from Yeo et al. [19]. Briefly, 10 \u03bcl of a 5 x 103 promastigotes/ml dilution of each culture was spread evenly over the surface of the solid medium, plates sealed with parafilm and incubated at 25\u00b0C until individual clonal colonies became visible. One to ten colonies were isolated from each plate and inoculated into 2.5 ml of \u03b1-MEM, 10% FBS and both selective antibiotics. The cloned isolates were screened for fluorescence by epifluorescence microscopy and highly expressing cultures were selected. To confirm expression of both fluorescent proteins 1 ml of 1 x 107 promastigotes/ml was mixed with 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), incubated for 30 mins at room temperature, washed in 1 ml of PBS, centrifuged at 1800 x g for 10 mins, resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of PBS, and 100 \u03bcl of the suspension applied to individual wells in a multiwell polysine-coated slide, which was left to settle for 30 mins at room temperature. Excess fluid was removing by blotting, the slide washed three times in PBS (5 mins) and left to air dry; 10 \u03bcl of Vectashield mounting medium incorporating DAPI (Vector Laboratories, USA) was added to each well, covered with a coverslip and sealed with clear nail polish. Samples were examined using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope and colonies containing dual-fluorescent single organisms were thus identified.\n\n\nFACS analysis of clones\nFrom the selected cultures 1 x 107 parasites were taken at mid-log phase and washed with PBS three times by centrifugation at 1800 x g for 10 mins at 4\u00b0C, the pellet resuspended in 300 \u03bcl PBS, 700 \u03bcl of 100% ice-cold methanol added, and homogenised gently by inverting the tube. After 10 mins incubation at 4\u00b0C, suspensions were washed three times by centrifugation at 1800 x g for 10 mins with PBS at 4\u00b0C and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS (giving a final concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml). Propidium iodide (PI) and RNAse A were added to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml and 1 \u03bcg/ml respectively and incubated for 30 mins at 37\u00b0C, protected from light. When bound to DNA and excited at 488 nm PI emits red fluorescence, and the fluorescence emitted by individual cells can be measured and compared to infer ploidy. Fluorescence was detected using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) with a setting of 10000 events for each sample. Data were gated to exclude clumps and debris and the cell clusters were plotted as area histograms (FlowJo v10.1).\n\n\nGenetic analyses of clones\nSeveral genetic analyses were performed on subsets of the 41 cloned hybrids generated at LSHTM. These were: MLST of nuclear and kinetoplastid targets; whole genome sequencing; targeted amplification of the HASPB locus.\n\n\nConfirmation of integration and MLST sequencing\nDNA was extracted from clonal cultures using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, USA) during the mid-log phase, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Using Primer-BLAST software [18] appropriate primers were selected for the regions flanking the plasmid vector genomic insertion, with one primer hybridising within the expression cassette and one to a SSU sequence absent from the plasmid (S1 Fig). Integration in all selected transgenic hybrid clones and parental strains was confirmed by amplification and DNA electrophoresis.\nFor multilocus sequence typing (MLST) three nuclear genes were selected, encoding an hypothetical protein in chromosome 36 (Ch36-1130), a non-coding sequence in chromosome 36 (Ch36-0350), a hypothetical protein in chromosome 28 (Ch28), together with a kinetoplastid gene encoding cytochrome b, all targets containing known SNPs suitable for analysis of genetic exchange [19] (S1 Table). Amplification conditions were optimized with different annealing temperatures and PCR performed in 20 \u03bcl reaction mixture containing 1 \u03bcl of sample, 2 \u03bcl of 10 x NH4 Reaction Buffer (Bioline, UK), 0.8 \u03bcl of 50 mM MgCl2 (Bioline), 1.6 \u03bcl of 2 mM dNTPs (Bioline), 1 \u03bcl of 20 pmol/\u03bcl forward primer and reverse primer, 0.2 \u03bcl of 5U/\u03bcl BIOTAQ DNA Polymerase solution (Bioline) and 12.4 \u03bcl of ultra-pure water. Amplification conditions were 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of: 30 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 30 seconds at primer/gene specific TAN (S1 Table), 30 seconds at 72\u00b0C, and a final elongation step of 5 minutes at 72\u00b0C. Products were confirmed by gel electrophoresis with 1.5% m/v agarose in Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer containing 0.1 \u03bcl/ml of 10000 x GelRed Nucleic Acid Stain (Biotium, USA). The amplified MLST targets were excised from the gel, purified using QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nSequencing reactions were performed in 10 \u03bcl of a mixture containing 1 \u03bcl of sample, 0.5 \u03bcl of BigDye (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), 1.7 \u03bcl of BigDye reaction buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), 1 \u03bcl of 3.2 pmol/\u03bcl primer and 5.8 \u03bcl of ultra-pure water. Reaction conditions were 1 minute at 96\u00b0C for DNA denaturation and 25 cycles of: 10 seconds at 96\u00b0C, 5 seconds at 50\u00b0C and 4 mins at 60\u00b0C, with a rapid thermal ramp of 1\u00b0C/second. DNA was then precipitated with ethanol by adding 8 \u03bcl of ultra-pure water and 32 \u03bcl of 100% ice cold ethanol to each sample, with incubation for 15 mins. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 x g for 45 mins at 4\u00b0C, supernatant carefully removed, 50 \u03bcl of 70% ice cold ethanol added and after a brief vortex, samples were centrifuged at 2000 x g for 20 mins at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was again removed, and samples dried at 90\u00b0C for 1 min. 10 \u03bcl of Hi-Di formamide (ThermoFisher Scientific) was added to each sample and the sequencing was performed on an ABI3730 machine (Applied Biosystems, USA). The forward and reverse sequences for each gene were aligned to create consensus sequences and identify SNPs by comparison between both parental strains and the hybrids. Nucleotide positions displaying allelic heterozygosity (split peaks) were classified according to IUPAC nomenclature. A total of 24 hybrid progeny clones were analysed, 13 derived from 5 P. argentipes and 11 from 5 P. orientalis, together with clones representing the two parents (Table 2).\n\n\nComparative genomics of parents and hybrid progeny\nWhole genomes of both parents and cloned progeny were sequenced at the Karolinska Institute (Sweden) and/or at the Genome Institute of Singapore, using a combination of Illumina and PacBio. A reference assembly was generated for the PacBio sequenced parental strain and was scaffolded using the companion annotation server [20]. Fastq data for parental and progeny strains were aligned to the PacBio reference using bwa (v0.7.17) [21] and processed using samtools (v1.12) [22]. Small variants were called using gatk HaplotypeCaller (v4.1.4.1) [23]. Parent-specific SNPs were found by comparing frequencies of alternate alleles in both parent strains, selecting those that were homozygous for different alleles. Frequencies of parent-specific SNPs were then extracted from progeny and were used to construct bottle brush plots using R to detect recombination. S2 Table lists the accession numbers on the European Nucleotide Archive of the genome sequences from one of the parental and 26 of the hybrid clones.\n\n\nHASPB diversity\nFor HASBP, which is a component of the rK28 antigen used in VL diagnosis and of a therapeutic vaccine under trial [24], two primers (LdonHASPBfor 5\u2019- CATAAAACCACTGAGGC-3\u2019 and LdonHASPBrev 5\u2019-ATCTTCGTTCTTCTCCTG-3\u2019) were designed to amplify the repeated regions in the HASPB1 and HASPB2 genes of three parental samples and 7 hybrid clones, as described above but using annealing temperature of 52\u00b0C, and 0.4 \u03bcM dNTPs. Each band separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels was excised and purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction, and BigDye reactions conducted with the same amplification primers. Consensus nucleotide sequences were aligned with L. donovani reference genome and translated into amino acid sequence, using Bioedit and Chromas software.\n\n\nDiversity of diagnostic and vaccine candidates\nA wider selection of published proposed L. donovani vaccine and diagnostic candidates was made to compare the diversity between parents and among progeny. Criteria for selection of targets were: high antigenicity; involvement in surface signalling or vital Leishmania metabolism; sequence data or nomenclature that allowed access to such data in the public domain. The gene sequences were extracted from alignments with NCBI database sequences. The SNP-containing sequences were translated to amino acids and a table created with all SNPs classified as either synonymous (no amino acid change), missense (amino acid substitution present) or stop-codon inducing. Finally, a list was created of targets observed to have amino acid sequence diversity (missense and stop codon inducing mutations) impact on diagnostic or vaccine candidates.",
    "Results": "Detection and recovery of hybrids\nTwo methods were used to detect primary hybrid Leishmania from experimental infection\u2014flow cytometry and cultivation of sand fly guts in double-selective media. Both methods revealed presence of hybrid cells, although only in late stage infections (days 7\u20139 PBM) from P. orientalis and P. argentipes, both of these sand fly species being the proven natural vectors of L. donovani. Early stage infections (days 2\u20133 PBM) did not yield any hybrids in all four sand fly species (Table 3 and 4); bacterial or fungal infections were higher in these early stage samples (Table 4). Flow cytometry gave positive results in 2 out of 3 experiments with late stage infections in P. orientalis and 2 out of 4 experiments with late stage infections in P. argentipes, although numbers of hybrid cells detected by flow cytometry were very low (Table 3).\nRecovery of hybrids in double drug selective media was successful with all 3 late stage infections of P. orientalis and 4 of 7 late stage infections of P. argentipes. Non-hybrid cells usually survived for up to 1 week. Stably growing cultures were obtained in 16% and 10% of isolates from P. orientalis and P. argentipes, respectively (Table 4). All these selected cultures showed both red and green fluorescence by fluorescence microscopy.\n\n\nMorphology of hybrid Leishmania in sand flies\nMorphology of L. donovani was evaluated at days 7\u20139 PBM with gut smears of P. argentipes co-infected with both parental strains. Hybrid Leishmania were present in both abdominal and thoracic parts of the guts. Representation of three morphological forms among parental and hybrid cells bordered on statistical significance (Chi-square = 9.066, d.f. = 4, P = 0.059). Elongated nectomonads (EN) were more frequent in the GR347 green parental strain than in the AM459 red strain and hybrids (Fig 1).\nSP, short promastigotes, EN, elongated nectomonads, MP, metacyclic promastigotes, and potentially hybrid yellow short promastigotes.\n\n\nHybrid clones express both fluorescence proteins and are principally diploid\nOf the 19 isolates from dissected sand flies, 41 clonal colonies were obtained, 31 clones from batch 1, 10 from batch 3 and none from batch 2; 14 were derived from P. orientalis and 27 from P. argentipes. All the clones were initially pre-screened for green and red fluorescing cells using an epifluorescence microscope (Table 5). Eight clonal isolates, highly expressing both green and red fluorescence, and parental strain GR347 in duplicate, were selected to assess ploidy of the hybrid population (Fig 2). The DNA contents of the parental strain (P1, GR347) and the clonal isolates clearly showed 2n (G1) and 4n (G2/M) peaks. The percentage of cells in the G1 phase for all the samples ranged from 44.1% to 68.6%, while the percentage in the G2/M phase was between 14.3% to 19.7% (Fig 2). Cultures and single clonal hybrids, previously selected using epifluorescence microscopy from batches 1 and 3 and from both P. orientalis and P. argentipes, were viewed and hybrids confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig 3).\nPI, Propidium iodide; P1.1 and P1.2, parent GR347.\nOrigins of C1.3, C1.21, C1.23 and C1.25 are uncertain; + = presence of fluorescence;\u2014 = no fluorescence detected.\n\n\nMLST shows nuclear hybridisation\nTwenty-four of the hybrid clones were analysed by MLST. From the three nuclear markers, Ch28, Ch36-0350 and Ch36-1130, a total of 13 SNP sites were identified, where parental strains and hybrid clones showed differences, with the hybrid clones possessing allelic heterozygosity at multiple locations (Fig 4). For the cytochrome b kinetoplast gene, whilst the two parental strains possessed distinct genotypes at 5 positions, hybrid clones showed no heterozygosity, possessing only one of the parental genotypes (Fig 5).\nWT, Ethiopian L. donovani wild type. Parental strains P1 (GR347) and P2 (AM459); P1.1 and P1.2 (clones derived from GR347); P2.1 and P2.2 (clones derived from AM459). ARG and ORI denotes hybrid clones derived from P. argentipes and P. orientalis respectively. Clones from the same sand fly are indicated by distinct clone ID. SNPs with low level of confidence are denoted with lower cases. NA indicates sequencing data not available; R = G+A; Y = T+C; S = G+C; W = T+A; K = G+T; M = A+C.\n\n\nClonal progeny and chromosomal genomics\nBottle brush plots were used to compare parent 1 (GR347) and parent 2 (AM459) contributions to clonal progeny and to chromosomal diversity. Fig 6 illustrates diversity of chromosome 26 between 4 of the different clonal progeny (labelled 1026_S67; 1001_S42; 1002_S43; 1007_S46). A vertical line is drawn for each SNP position at which parent 1 and parent 2 are homozygous for different alleles. The lines are plotted on the x-axis according to the genomic position on the respective chromosome. The height of the line extending out from the midpoint represents the allele frequency at which both parent 1 (top/ depicted in red) and parent 2 (bottom/ depicted in blue) specific alleles are found in the progeny. The proportional contribution from each parent varies between different sequenced progeny, although at each site a contribution from both parents is almost always observed. As in Figs 6 and S2 plots parent 1 depicted in red and parent 2 depicted in blue to show the allele contributions. However, in S2 Fig contributions are shown for all 36 chromosomes (LDON_1 to LDON_36) of one of the clonal progeny (1026_S67). Hybridisation and allelic diversity are apparent and distributed across all chromosomes of the genome.\n\n\nCharacterization of HASPB antigen in parents and hybrid progeny\nAmplification of HASPB with primers LdonHASPBFor and LdonHASBPRev revealed two expected fragments of 1064 bp and 260 bp in parent 1, corresponding to repeat coding regions in HASPB1 and HASPB2 respectively. However, the same primers also amplified an unexpected fragment of around 420 bp in parent 2. All 7 hybrid clones (C1.1, C1.2, C1.7, C1.27, C1.32, C1.35, C1.36) had indistinguishable profiles with three amplicons of sizes corresponding with those in parental strains; a representative hybrid is shown in Fig 7. Despite multiple optimization the 1064 bp amplicons could not be sequenced, suggesting divergence in the templates. Sequencing of the 260 bp amplicons yielded the predicted HASPB2 repeated coding region in P1.2 and all 7 hybrid clones, and analysis of the 420 bp band of P2.1 and hybrid clones revealed a HASPB1/HASPB2-like combined composition across their 7 repeat coding regions.\nSizes (bp) adjacent to DNA ladder.\n\n\nGenomic diversity of parents and progeny in diagnostic and vaccine targets\nNCBI sequences of diagnostic and vaccine candidates were blasted against both parental and progeny genomes. Where function was known, most of the genes had roles either in signalling pathways (both intra- and extracellular) or metabolic pathways. In summary, many of the proteins were diverse between the progeny, including those involved in signalling and metabolism, hypothetical proteins coding for surface antigens, such as enolase, ATP synthase alpha subunit. In contrast, other proteins were highly conserved, such as histones and products of housekeeping genes (Table 6; S2 Fig).",
    "Discussion": "Trypanosomatids were originally considered to be entirely or predominantly clonal. With the advent of MLST and comparative genomics, evidence of genetic exchange became more apparent in natural populations of Leishmania [25,26]. Initially there were small studies, such as those in Peru [27] that gave convincing evidence of parental Leishmania and hybrid progeny. When larger, wide-ranging populations were analysed, encompassing different continents, it became clear that genetic exchange in Leishmania was commonplace and abundant [28\u201332]. Experimental research proved the occurrence of active genetic exchange in sand flies, demonstrated by infecting flies with pairs of transgenic Leishmania strains carrying different fluorescence and selective drug resistance markers [33,34].\nTransmission of infection was increased among hybrids [35]. The growth in the sand flies was dependent on the structure of Leishmania species and the presence of parasite HASPB and SHERP proteins, which could govern whether flies were permissive or resistant to infection [36]. Visualisation of fluorescent hybrids in situ was possible by microscopy of sand fly gut contents [37]. Mating competence could be observed in natural and unnatural vectors [4,38]. Extensive genetic diversity is seen in L. donovani infections [39] and evidence of meiosis sexual recombination in Leishmania species [40].\nHere, genetic crosses of two parental strains of L. donovani (GR347 and AM459) were achieved in the two species of sand fly, P. argentipes and P. orientalis. Successful crosses of the two parental strains of Leishmania in these two sand fly species, which have different geographical origins in India and Africa, confirmed the permissive nature of the vectors. Cloning of hybrid progeny from both P. argentipes and P. orientalis produced a series of clonal lines for studies of the nature and diversity of the progeny. The life cycle stages of the hybrids could be clearly visualised within these sand flies, and after cloning, FACS analysis indicated that progeny was predominantly diploid (Fig 2) and diploidy was shown to be consistent with the analyses of sand fly populations, for example by showing genetic profiles of progeny and hybrids among L. donovani in Ethiopia [7]. In contrast, progeny obtained from crosses under stress in vitro appeared to be predominantly tetraploid, and without classical meiosis [9,10].\nMultilocus sequence typing targeting three nuclear genes indicated that the progeny were hybrids. In contrast, the kinetoplast cytochrome b target had alternate SNPs derived uniparentally, as has been observed in the kinetoplast genome of other trypanosomatid hybrids [15]. This may be explicable by the complications of communication between kinetoplastid and nuclear genomes.\nGenome sequencing confirmed the diversity between cloned hybrid progeny, as exemplified by comparison of a single chromosome between 4 different progeny (Fig 6). Sequencing of all 36 chromosomes of a single progeny genome showed that the hybrid nature of the progeny was consistent across the entire genome, with fluctuations in the allele proportions, as shown in S2 Fig. This extraordinary diversity in the progeny of these genetic crosses was also apparent from the targeted comparative sequence analysis of diagnostic and vaccine candidates, in Table 6. This showed the widespread occurrence of missense mutations across diagnostic and vaccine expression sites of the genomes. In contrast sequence of house-keeping genes was more stable. Aneuploidy in the genomes of Leishmania is another manner in which gene expression and function can evolve [9].\nPoint-of-care diagnostic tests depend on specificity of antigens. Thus, genetic exchange in Leishmania can give rise to significant diagnostic challenges. As a simple example, the diversity of HASPB was apparent and of particular interest, because this stage-regulated surface protein, essential for development in sand flies, is considered to be a candidate component of therapeutic Leishmania vaccines. To protect efficacy the known diversity of HASPB has been incorporated into a chemotherapeutic vaccine under trial [24].\nOne approach to diagnostics and vaccine discovery is to apply comparative genomics to analyse the diversity of agents of leishmaniasis or of other infectious agents, collected in endemic regions or that are already present in biological archives. However, this approach can be demanding, ambitious and costly.\nAs we have seen from our research findings, another powerful approach is to perform genetic crosses in sand flies, analyse the diversity of the diploid progeny and assess the impact of genetic exchange on the diversity of antigen and vaccine candidates. This is an approach that may also be applicable to drug discovery, if potential drug targets are known or can be identified.\nThus, accumulation and conservation of biobanks, should continue to be a crucial part of vaccine, diagnostics and drug discovery. However, herein we have shown the emergence of novel diversity in candidate diagnostic and vaccine coding sequences can occur.\nWe have also demonstrated that further similar efforts to perform genetic crosses in sand flies can identify strategic high impact targets to guide future control of infectious diseases. Hopefully, the research presented here will encourage future impetus that will continue to benefit from the extraordinary analytical capacity of comparative genomics."
