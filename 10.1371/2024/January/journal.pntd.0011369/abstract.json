    "Abstract": "Pyrethroid resistance in Aedes aegypti has become widespread after almost two decades of frequent applications to reduce the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. Because few insecticide classes are available for public health use, insecticide resistance management (IRM) is proposed as a strategy to retain their use. A key hypothesis of IRM assumes that negative fitness is associated with resistance, and when insecticides are removed from use, susceptibility is restored. In Tapachula, Mexico, pyrethroids (PYRs) were used exclusively by dengue control programs for 15 years, thereby contributing to selection for high PYR resistance in mosquitoes and failure in dengue control. In 2013, PYRs were replaced by organophosphates\u2014insecticides from a class with a different mode of action. To test the hypothesis that PYR resistance is reversed in the absence of PYRs, we monitored Ae. aegypti\u2019s PYR resistance from 2016 to 2021 in Tapachula. We observed significant declining rates in the lethal concentration 50 (LC50), for permethrin and deltamethrin. For each month following the discontinuation of PYR use by vector control programs, we observed increases in the odds of mosquitoes dying by 1.5% and 8.4% for permethrin and deltamethrin, respectively. Also, knockdown-resistance mutations (kdr) in the voltage-gated sodium channel explained the variation in the permethrin LC50s, whereas variation in the deltamethrin LC50s was only explained by time. This trend was rapidly offset by application of a mixture of neonicotinoid and PYRs by vector control programs. Our results suggest that IRM strategies can be used to reverse PYR resistance in Ae. aegypti; however, long-term commitment by operational and community programs will be required for success."
