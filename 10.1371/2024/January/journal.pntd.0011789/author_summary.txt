Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonosis in tropical and subtropical regions. In the new world, it is caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan Leishmania infantum. In urban areas, domestic dogs are the primary reservoir. Increase in canine leishmaniasis (CanL) contributes to the increase in VL in humans. One mechanism of parasite survival is through regulation of microRNA (miRNA), responsible for translational control of transcripts related to anti-parasite immunity. One example is miR-194, which is increased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of dogs with leishmaniasis. In the present study, we found that increasing miR-194 increases parasite load, and decreasing miR-194 increases IL1β and NO. Subsequently, we found that the increase in NO depends on IL1β. Since NO its directly involved in parasite load control, these findings contribute to understanding how the parasite evades immune responses and paves the way for the discovery of new therapeutic targets.
