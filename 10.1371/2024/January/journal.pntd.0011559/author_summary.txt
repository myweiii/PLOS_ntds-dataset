Yearly, up two million people in poverty-stricken areas contract leishmaniasis, a disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania. When an infected sandfly takes a blood meal, Leishmania parasites enter the host where they are taken up by macrophages. Inside the macrophage, Leishmania parasites establish a niche where they can proliferate. The infection often leads to disability and can result in death. Moreover, the drugs currently available are unsatisfactory due to toxic side effects, high expenses or difficulties in usage. Drug screening assays that are currently used for compound screening often rely on mouse peritoneal macrophages. We have generated human induced pluripotent stem cell derived macrophages and used these as new host cells for Leishmania donovani in the testing of anti-leishmanial compounds. This model has many advantages. For one, it allows us to work with human cells, mimicking the natural infection more closely than murine cells. Secondly, it allows us to obtain bigger batches of uniform cells for screening campaigns. Finally, this approach aligns with the principles of the 3Rs, replacing the use of animals for cultivation of Leishmania and drug screening purposes.
