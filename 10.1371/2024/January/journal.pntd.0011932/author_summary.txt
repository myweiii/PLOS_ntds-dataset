Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease that causes disability to human beings and is caused by a group of filarial nematodes such as W. bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori while these parasites are transmitted by different species of vector mosquitoes. Nepal government started the MDA program in 2003 and has completed 6â€“11 rounds of anti-filarial medicine with DEC and albendazole between 2007 and 2022 in selected endemic districts of Central Nepal. TAS report showed a low level of infection (<2%) in all study districts. Interestingly we found that the antigen-positive cases were clustered in foci. We defined those circulating filarial antigen (CFA) positive clustered areas as hotspots and assessed MF infection among the adult community people after the MDA program. The result revealed evidence of MF prevalence above threshold in the hotspots of two districts one each from the hilly region (Dhading district) and Terai region (Mahottari district) even after the completion of the MDA program. In those areas, alternative treatment strategies should be employed to reduce the active infection which can serve as reservoirs for recrudescence transmission. Hence it is urgently needed to identify and screen MF infection among community individuals of hotspots after completion of the MDA program even in other districts.
