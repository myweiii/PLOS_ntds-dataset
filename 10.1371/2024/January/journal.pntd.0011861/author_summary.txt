Trachoma is a chronic conjunctivitis caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Repeated infections lead to trachomatous conjunctival scarring (TS) which can progress to potentially blinding trachomatous trichiasis (TT). In trachoma hyperendemic conditions, women have an increased risk, scarring and TT. This study determined if there were gender differences in scarring prevalence and severity when trachoma prevalence approaches elimination, in a formerly trachoma hyperendemic region.
Overall, about half of all study participants had scarring. Scarring and severity of scarring increased with age. However, compared to males, more females had any scarring and they had more severe scarring.
Scarring prevalence and more severe scarring prevalence was higher in communities with higher active trachoma prevalence. Adjusting for age and community active trachoma prevalence, women still had more scarring and severe scarring compared to men. The data suggest that processes occur that lead to women preferentially progressing towards more severe scarring compared to men. Gaining a better understanding of what may be causing this increased progression, could lead to the identification of a potential modifiable risk factor.
