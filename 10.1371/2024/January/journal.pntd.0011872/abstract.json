    "Background": "Gut epithelium is the first natural barrier against Trichinella spiralis larval invasion, but the mechanism by which larval penetration of gut epithelium is not completely elucidated. Previous studies showed that proteases secreted by T. spiralis intestinal infective larvae (IIL) degraded tight junctions (TJs) proteins of gut epithelium and mediated larval invasion. A new T. spiralis serine proteinase (TsSPc) was identified in the IIL surface proteins and ES proteins, rTsSPc bound to the intestinal epithelial cell (IECs) and promoted larval invasion of IECs. The aim of this study was to characterize the interacted proteins of TsSPc and IECs, and to investigate the molecular mechanisms of TsSPc mediating larval invasion of gut mucosa.",
    "Methodology/Principal finding": "IIFT results showed natural TsSPc was detected in infected murine intestine at 6, 12 hours post infection (hpi) and 3 dpi. The results of GST pull-down, mass spectrometry (MS) and Co-IP indicated that rTsSPc bound and interacted specifically with receptor for activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1) in Caco-2 cells. rTsSPc did not directly hydrolyze the TJs proteins. qPCR and Western blot showed that rTsSPc up-regulated RACK1 expression, activated MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, reduced the expression levels of gut TJs (occludin and claudin-1) and adherent protein E-cad, increased the paracellular permeability and damaged the integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier. Moreover, the RACK1 inhibitor HO and ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor PD98059 abolished the rTsSPc activating ERK1/2 pathway, they also inhibited and abrogated the rTsSPc down-regulating expression of occludin, claudin-1 and E-cad in Caco-2 monolayer and infected murine intestine, impeded larval invasion and improved intestinal epithelial integrity and barrier function, reduced intestinal worm burdens and alleviated intestinal inflammation.",
    "Conclusions": "rTsSPc bound to RACK1 receptor in gut epithelium, activated MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, decreased the expression of gut epithelial TJs proteins and disrupted the epithelial integrity, consequently mediated T. spiralis larval invasion of gut epithelium. The results are valuable to understand T. spiralis invasion mechanism, and TsSPc might be regarded as a vaccine target against T. spiralis invasion and infection."
