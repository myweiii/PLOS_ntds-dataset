Lipid droplets (LDs) are organelles with diverse cell metabolism and signaling roles. Lipid droplet protein kinase (LDK) is responsible for LD formation in trypanosomatids, but its function in Leishmania spp. remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that deleting the LDK gene in Leishmania infantum has no impact on parasite growth. However, it reduces the amount of LDs during the stationary phase of parasite growth. When exposed to myriocin, known to induce LD production, we observed a decrease in LDs during both the logarithmic and stationary phases of LDK-knockout parasites. Additionally, LDK-deficient parasites exhibit reduced infectivity and increased resistance to trivalent antimony. In summary, our findings suggest that LDK plays a crucial role in the formation and/or maintenance of LDs in L. infantum.
