Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating parasitic disease that the World Health Organization (WHO) has earmarked for elimination by 2030 through a combination of mass distribution of anti-parasitic medicines and disease management approaches. Great strides have been made towards the elimination of LF as a public health problem, but nearly 900 million people still require treatment every year. In recent years, new combinations of medicines have been shown to improve the treatment of LF, yet there remain substantial gaps in understanding of apparent variability in treatment success and on the best treatment and management approaches to alleviate chronic morbidity. Some of these questions could be addressed through the development of an LF global data platform, which would enable pooled analyses of all available individual participant data. Here, we present the results of a systematic literature review of the LF treatment study landscape. We estimate the abundance of individual data on treatment of infection and morbidity and describe the characteristics of the studies and participants that have generated these data. We argue that collating and curating these data into a data LF platform could help to fill gaps in understanding of the best ways to treat infection and disease and enhance prospects of eliminating LF by 2030.
