Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are a group of three parasitic worms that infect humans through transmission of contaminated soil. An estimated 1.5 billion people world wide are infected, with the highest prevalence reported in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America. STH may cause gastro-intestinal morbidity that is known to be associated with malnutrition in children and accounts for 2.7 million disability-adjusted life years annually. The World Health Organization strategy is to control morbidity through the periodic treatment of albendazole or mebendazole of at-risk people in endemic areas, namely pre-school and school-aged children, women of reproductive age, and adults in certain occupations that pose a high-risk for transmission. Adult populations not treated may continue to act as reservoirs for STH. Modeling studies have shown that transmission of STH may be interrupted through implementation of community-wide MDA (cMDA) that targets at-risk and adult populations. Studies on cMDA for STH to assess morbidity or elimination are limited. This is a mixed-methods implementation science analysis on implementation of the DeWorm3 community cluster randomized controlled trial that aims to determine the feasibility of interrupting STH in Benin, India, and Malawi. Qualitative focus group discussions and quantitative analysis of census and coverage survey data aims to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing cMDA and compares results between high- and low-coverage clusters across the three countries. The findings may support the development of STH program guidelines and delivery strategies.
