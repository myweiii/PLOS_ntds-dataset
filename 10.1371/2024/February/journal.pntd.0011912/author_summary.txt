Typhoid fever is a major health issue in low- and middle-income countries, causing illness and death. The World Health Organization recommends the use of typhoid-conjugate vaccines to combat its spread. However, limited data on typhoid prevalence in these countries hinders effective vaccination programs. Environmental surveillance, which involves detecting Salmonella Typhi DNA in the environment, has emerged as a method to identify high-risk areas for typhoid transmission. Nevertheless, this approach is costly and requires infrastructure often unavailable in many communities. To address this, we conducted a study in Nepal to explore a low-cost and sustainable typhoid surveillance method. We examined typhoid bacteriophages in surface and drinking water across communities with varying population densities and typhoid burdens. Phages were easily detectable in communities with high typhoid burdens but less prevalent in areas with lower burdens. The isolated phages exhibited specificity for S. Typhi and were effective against different bacterial strains in Nepal. This study demonstrates that phage-based assays can be a simple and affordable tool for typhoid environmental surveillance. This method can help identify areas that require vaccination prioritization and interventions for clean water and sanitation. By utilizing phage-based assays, health authorities can better understand typhoid transmission and implement targeted control measures.
