    "Abstract": "Opisthorchis viverrini is a parasitic liver fluke contracted by consumption of raw fish, which affects over 10 million people in Southeast Asia despite sustained control efforts. Chronic infections are a risk factor for the often fatal bile duct cancer, cholangiocarcinoma. Previous modeling predicted rapid elimination of O. viverrini following yearly mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. However, field data collected in affected populations shows persistence of infection, including heavy worm burden, after many years of repeated interventions. A plausible explanation for this observation is systematic adherence of individuals in health campaigns, such as MDA and education, with some individuals consistently missing treatment."
