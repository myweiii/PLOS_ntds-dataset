Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular parasite causing sleeping sickness in humans and nagana disease in cattle. The parasite invades the bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid and only recently, it has been shown to infect additional tissues such as skin, adipose tissue, or lungs. While the glucose-based metabolism of the bloodstream form is well understood, the parasiteâ€™s metabolism in these secondary tissues has not been sufficiently explored, despite its importance for drug development. One possibility is the use of gluconeogenesis since the mammalian-infective stages can use glycerol as a carbon and ATP source. First, enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis have to be identified, then it can be tested if the pathway is advantageous for the survival of the parasite. We generated mutants in four different enzymes potentially involved in this metabolic pathway. Surprisingly, the flux in gluconeogenesis was maintained in all cell lines tested, implying that another non-canonical enzyme participates in the production of glucose from glycerol in these parasites.
