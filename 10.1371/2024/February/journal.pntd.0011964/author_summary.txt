Shigella spp. is one of the WHO-designated "antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens" that is the leading cause of bacterial diarrhea among children worldwide. The distribution of Shigella species varies depending on the geographic location, particularly in regions where environmental risk factors like substandard water quality, limited healthcare accessibility, and insufficient sanitation are widespread. The presence of serotype diversity and drug resistance combinations often leads to treatment failures. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the prevailing serogroups and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Shigella species in different geographical areas to implement effective treatment strategies. We have identified 535 Shigella positive cases from 9276 diarrheal cases. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Shigella globally requires a profound understanding of its genetic diversity, as there is significant regional variation in MDR strains. In our study, we observed a broad spectrum of resistance among the Shigella strains, with over 53.6% of the isolates demonstrating multidrug resistance. Representative isolates were evaluated for antimicrobial resistance encoding and virulence-associated genes as they enact significantly in disease development and interaction with the host immune system. This report marks the initial presentation of the outcomes from long-term surveillance and molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistances in clinical Shigella strains in Kolkata since 2011. The outcome of this investigations will guide in identifying emerging antimicrobial resistance trend, formulating suitable treatment guidelines tailored to the communityâ€™s needs, and establishing baseline data for comparison with potential outbreak strains in the future.
