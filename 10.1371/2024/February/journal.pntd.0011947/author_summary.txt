For soil-transmitted helminths (STH), control is centred around mass drug administration (MDA) of eligible subgroups without prior diagnosis, aiming to achieve 75% drug coverage. MDA programmes are monitored by assessing whether drug coverage and infection prevalence and intensity, aggregated to a spatial scale, typically an administrative unit such as a district, have met programmatic targets. Spatial heterogeneity in drug coverage, prevalence, and intensity is commonplace and well documented. However, little attention has been paid to the spatial scales of this heterogeneity and the implications it has on providing the basis to inform the cessation or continuation of prophylactic mass treatment. We present a clear analysis showing that fine scale spatial heterogeneity in drug coverage is commonplace even in well implemented MDA programmes. We show that aggregating data at the district level, which is routine for deworming programmes, can give misleading information on which to base future treatment decisions, specifically the premature reduction in frequency, or cessation of MDA, because fine scale heterogeneity is not captured by larger aggregations. This work highlights the critical need to define context specific spatial scales for monitoring and evaluating interventions implemented in different transmission settings.
