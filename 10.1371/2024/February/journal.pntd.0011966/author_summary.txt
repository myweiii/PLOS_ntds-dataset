Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the blood fluke Schistosoma. Five species of Schistosoma cause intestinal damage and inflammation, but the current method of diagnosis is not satisfactory because it lacks sensitivity and timeliness. Therefore, we applied metabolomics to identify the overall types and abundance of compounds in biological samples to discover new markers. Previous metabolomic studies focused only on infection with one species, making it difficult to detect disease caused by other species. Moreover, no study examined progression of intestinal disease. In this study, we used a mouse model and metabolomics to investigate changes in the gut environment from the early stage of the disease and identify markers of early infection caused by three different species of Schistosoma. We found that changes in compounds related to lipid metabolism since early infection and some pathways, such as glycosaminoglycan degradation, might be related to intestinal disease. We identified five compounds as early biomarkers of schistosomiasis, which were shared among the three species. These compounds could be used for future biomarker development, which could facilitate diagnosis of schistosomiasis.
