The Lassa virus is passed from rodents to humans, causing a disease that kills thousands of people every year in West Africa. To control spread, scientists are trying to understand why some rodents are more susceptible to the virus than others. One factor they are studying is the genetic makeup of the rodentsâ€™ immune systems. They found that a specific allele of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC I), called ManaMHC-I*006, was associated with resistance to and clearance of the virus, while other alleles were associated with susceptibility. They also found that the immunogenetic composition of rodents differed between areas where Lassa virus is endemic or non-endemic. These findings can help predict where the virus might emerge and can help researchers develop a vaccine to protect the rodents from getting the virus, which can ultimately help prevent the spread of the disease to humans. The authors emphasize the significance of adopting a One-Health approach in thinking about wildlife and human health.
