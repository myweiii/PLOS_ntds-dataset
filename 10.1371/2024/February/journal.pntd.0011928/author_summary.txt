Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that infects 5â€“10 million people worldwide. HTLV-1 infection can cause serious diseases including hematologic malignancy, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), and progressive neurologic disease known as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraplegia (HAM/TSP). An increase in the mortality rate among HTLV-1-infected individuals has become an issue of concern in recent years. Differences in HTLV-1 infection rates and subgroup distribution are considered to be caused by the historical global movement of HTLV-1-infected individuals. Furthermore, recent global population movements have resulted in the redistribution of HTLV-1-infected individuals, which may lead to outbreaks of ATL and HAM/TSP in non-endemic areas. In this study, we investigated the molecular characteristics of HTLV-1 in East Asia and found that the transcontinental subgroup was more prevalent in Taiwan, whereas the Japanese subgroup was common in Japan. The difference in subgroup distribution may be attributed to the initial spread of the transcontinental subgroup in East Asia, followed by the influx of the Japanese subgroup.
