We present a chromosome-level assembled and annotated genome sequence of the freshwater gastropod snail Biomphalara glabrata, offering a comprehensive genomic view of the structure and organization of two crucial immune-related gene families: the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and fibrinogen-domain containing protein (FReD) genes. B. glabrata is an important intermediate host of schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease afflicting more than 251 million people worldwide. In addition to offering insight into the diversification of fibrinogen-related protein (FREP) genes, the high-quality genome assembly of the model vector snail B. glabrata provided by this study will enhance our understanding of fundamental biological processes at the molecular level and accelerate snail-based research of schistosomiasis.
