Although there is no specific treatment for dengue to date, montelukast shows promise as a potential therapeutic agent. An open-label study previously showed a 71% reduction in dengue shock among patients with dengue who were administered montelukast. However, concerns were raised regarding the clinical studyâ€™s lack of a power analysis or predefined statistical difference. Because of its affordability, relatively safe profile, and widespread availability, exploring its role in preventing dengue complications holds great significance. This study is a double-blind clinical trial with pragmatic design assessing the efficacy of montelukast in dengue. In contrast to the previous open-label study, montelukast does not reduce the incidence of warning signs among patients with dengue. Nevertheless, a reduction in the incidence of transaminase elevations was observed. In conclusion, montelukast should not be used for the prevention of warning signs in patients with dengue. However, the observed decrease in transaminase elevations warrants further investigation to evaluate the potential effect of montelukast.
