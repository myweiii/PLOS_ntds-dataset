Senegal has nine Social Rehabilitation Villages (VRS) which were established in March 1976. These are former leprosaria converted into villages and are known for their high leprosy transmission. To improve screening and reduce transmission of the disease, we implemented from October 2020 to February 2022, an active leprosy screening strategy associated with the administration of a single dose of rifampicin (SDR) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to household and social contacts in these VRS. This operational research study showed that the strategy was feasible under programmatic conditions with 7115(98.6%) people accepting the test among 7219 present and 6408(97.8%) people accepting and taking SDR among 6554 eligible. We found 39 new cases in six VRS among 6,124 examined. The geographical coordinates of the households were also entered using the adapted ’Open Data Kit’ (ODK) application, which allowed the identification of nine highly prevalent clusters including 27/39 (69%) of new cases in 490/7,850 (6%) inhabitants in five VRS with cases detected. Our results can be used to guide targeted and more efficient active case finding.
