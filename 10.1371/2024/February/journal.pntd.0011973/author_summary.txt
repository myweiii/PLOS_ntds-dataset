The “festa dei serpari” is a unique sacro-profane ritual held each 1st of May in the small town of Cocullo, Central Italy. In this ceremony, dozens of non-venomous free-ranging snakes are captured by serpari (snake catchers) and showcased to thousands of pilgrims and tourists. Therefore, we aimed to assess the parasites and microorganisms of snakes within this unique epidemiological context to identify potential zoonotic pathogens. Snakes were examined and ectoparasites, blood and feces were collected, and morpho-molecular studies were performed. Overall, 28.5% (32/112) of snakes were positive for at least one parasite and/or microorganism. We identified new records of Mesostigmata mites as well as Leishmania tarentolae for the first time in Italian snakes. Importantly, we detected zoonotic microorganisms such as Rickettsia sp. in Aesculapian snake, as well as orally transmitted pathogens (i.e., Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Pseudomonas sp., Proteus vulgaris) from blood and feces of four species of snakes. Thus, snakes handled in this tradition may play a role in the zoonotic transmission of pathogens, given the contact with humans during this unique event.
