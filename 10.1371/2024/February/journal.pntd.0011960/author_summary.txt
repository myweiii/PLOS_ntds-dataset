In visceral leishmaniasis (VL), antigen specific CD4+ T cell responses are muted hindering the control of the Leishmania donovani infection. IL-7 signaling is crucial for CD4+ T cell survival and function, and gene expression analysis indicated that the IL-7 pathway could be altered in VL. Thus, we investigate if impaired IL-7 signaling could explain the loss of antigen specific T cell response in VL. Although we didn’t observe significant reduction of IL7RA mRNA by RT-qPCR, yet, the levels of soluble IL-7Rα (sIL-7Rα) were reduced in plasma of VL patients compared to ECs. Furthermore, the levels of soluble IL-7 were higher in plasma from VL patients compared to ECs and their CD4+ T cells exhibited heightened IL-7 receptor protein expression. Surprisingly, VL patient CD4+ T cells showed increased IL-7 signaling potential, as evidenced by higher phosphorylation of STAT5 upon IL-7 stimulation. While altered, the findings presented here do not attributed the impaired effector function of VL CD4+ T cells to defective IL-7 signaling. We speculate that the elevated plasma IL-7 is part of a homeostatic feedback mechanism in response to the reduced IL7RA transcription in CD4+ T cells.
