Lymphatic filariasis, commonly called as elephantiasis is a gruesome disfiguring disease caused by parasitic worms. Some of the infected individuals develop asthma like hypersensitivity reaction called Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia (TPE), which can be fatal. TPE is believed to be caused by allergens released by the larval (microfilariae) stages of the lymphatic filarial worms in the lung blood vessels. However, no potential allergen have been described to date that is responsible for causing the TPE symptoms. In this study we screened a phage display cDNA expression library of the microfilariae stages of the lymphatic filarial parasite with IgE monoclonal antibodies prepared from subjects with lymphatic filarial infections, some of these individuals also exhibited TPE clinical symptoms. This approach identified a novel nematode specific pan allergen (NPA). When tested in the laboratory, NPA showed that it can trigger histamine release from mast cells, trigger inflammatory responses in lung cells and can cause accumulation of eosinophils in the tissue. All these are typical clinical symptoms of TPE. Thus, we conclude in this study that targeting the NPA can be a potential treatment option for alleviating the allergy and hypersensitivity reactions such as in TPE during parasitic infections.
