Many bat species share space with people and domestic animals. Bat use of buildings, which serve as roosts where they raise young and sleep, is increasing globally with the loss of natural habitat. In such settings, interactions between bats, people, and domestic animals may occur. This may be cause for concern as bats can carry pathogens that infect people or domestic animals and interactions with bats may create opportunities for exposure to these pathogens. Until now, the characteristics of human-bat interactions in buildings, and their potential for exposing humans and domestic animals to bat-borne parasites, were unknown. In our study, people living and working in buildings used simultaneously by bats reported frequent interactions with bats and their feces, which can facilitate human exposure to bat pathogens. These interactions happened frequently and over many years. We demonstrate that shared building use by bats and people in rural Kenya leads to prolonged, frequent, and sometimes intense interactions between bats, humans, and domestic animals, consistent with exposure opportunities that can lead to pathogen spillover. Identifying the settings that may lead to human contact with pathogens is critical for developing countermeasures to mitigate public health hazards.
