The return of trachoma transmission after elimination as a public health problem has been reached is a concern for control programs globally. Currently, many district-level trachoma surveillance surveys (conducted ≥2 years since elimination threshold has been reached) are resulting in a prevalence above the established threshold. Once a district returns above threshold, a program typically restarts costly mass drug administration campaigns and conducts more surveys. This study’s aim was to monitor recrudescence through a “wait and watch” approach within Amhara, Ethiopia. This entailed waiting to restart mass drug administration within 2 districts with trachoma prevalence above but close to the threshold at surveillance survey, then surveying the districts 1 year later using traditional and alternative indicators. These post-surveillance surveys assessed traditional trachoma signs, and additionally, children provided a dried blood spot for serology outcomes and a conjunctival swab for infection. The results of the study demonstrated that both districts had a prevalence below threshold with low levels of infection and serological evidence of transmission, and thus mass drug administration interventions are no longer warranted. The wait and watch approach represents a surveillance strategy that could lead to fewer surveys and mass drug administration campaigns and thus savings in programmatic costs with reduced usage of antibiotics.
