    "Background": "We examined the impact of the Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) infection on the survival outcomes of spontaneous rupture Hepatocellular Carcinoma (srHCC) patients undergoing hepatectomy.",
    "Methods": "Between May 2013 and December 2021, 157 consecutive srHCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were divided into an no C. sinensis group (n = 126) and C. sinensis group (n = 31). To adjust for differences in preoperative characteristics an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was done, using propensity scores. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared before and after IPTW. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine whether the C. sinensis infection was an independent prognostic factor after IPTW.",
    "Results": "In original cohort, the no C. sinensis group did not show a survival advantage over the C. sinensis group. After IPTW adjustment, the median OS for the C. sinensis group was 9 months, compared to 29 months for the no C. sinensis group. C. sinensis group have worse OS than no C. sinensis group (p = 0.024), while it did not differ in RFS(p = 0.065). The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that C. sinensis infection and lower age were associated with worse OS.",
    "Conclusions": "The C. sinensis infection has an adverse impact on os in srHCC patients who underwent hepatectomy."
