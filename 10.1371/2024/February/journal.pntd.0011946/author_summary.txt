In India, VL has been endemic in four states (Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal), having over 165 million population. The national programme achieved elimination (<1 case / 10,000 population/year per ‘block’) in 625 of the 633 endemic blocks in 2021. While sustaining elimination level, the programme needs to target other blocks yet to reach elimination to achieve the WHO 2030 target. We fitted a variety of spatiotemporal models to 72-monthly reported VL cases (2013–2018, training period) from 491 endemic and 27 non-endemic blocks in Bihar and Jharkhand. The best fitting model was validated with 24-month reported cases (2019–2020, test period). Model predictions agree with >93 and 99% of the monthly-observations for the periods. Forecasting for 2021–2023 showed that incidence is likely to exceed elimination threshold in 16–18 and 33–38 historically high endemic blocks of Jharkhand and Bihar. Fitted model showed that VL incidence is positively associated with mean temperature, minimum temperature, enhanced vegetation index, precipitation, and isothermality, and negatively with maximum temperature, land surface temperature, soil moisture and population density. Forecasting VL incidence at block level can aid to monitor elimination progress, target the blocks yet to reach elimination and long-term monitoring of risk of resurgence during post-elimination.
