Assessment of schistosomiasis control programs is a crucial step to understanding the success rate of these control programs. The Schistoscope: an AI-powered automated digital microscope could overcome the limitations of conventional microscopy in endemic resource limited settings as well as in settings lacking microscopy experts. In this study, we carried out an extensive validation of the Schistoscopeâ€™s diagnostic performance for diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis compared to conventional microscopy as well as more accurate diagnostic tests such as real-time PCR and the up-converting particle (UCP) lateral flow (LF) test for the detection of circulating anodic antigen (CAA) on freshly collected urines. We also assessed the performance of the Schistoscope for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis on banked sample slides, using a simple and sustainable storage method, for approximately two years. Having a tool that can prospectively and retrospectively analyse samples in an easy and sustainable way could facilitate schistosomiasis control programs in settings with little or no access to microscopists. Overall, we found the Schistoscope to be as good as conventional microscopy for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis, and given its downstream advantages of digital health, it would serve as a valuable diagnostic/screening tool in resource limited endemic settings.
