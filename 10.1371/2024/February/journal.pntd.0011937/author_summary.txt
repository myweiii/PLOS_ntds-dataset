Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by blood-sucking kissing bugs, is a major neglected tropical disease affecting millions of people worldwide. The insect vector Rhodnius prolixus is highly sensitive to environmental factors, including temperature. In this study, we investigated the effects of different temperatures on R. prolixus and its interaction with T. cruzi, as well as the nutritional habits and energy consumption of the vector. We exposed uninfected and infected insects to various temperatures, and monitored their survival, development, body and blood meal weights, urine production, and T. cruzi infection over their lifespan. Our results revealed that temperature significantly influenced R. prolixus development, life-cycle, and its interaction with T. cruzi. Insects exposed to higher temperatures had shorter development time, increased mortality, and reduced ability to maintain weight. Infection further compromised the ability of the triatomines to retain weight gained by blood-feeding, and this effect correlated with parasite load. Additionally, T. cruzi multiplication varied with temperature, with lower temperatures associated with lower parasite concentration. Our findings have important implications for understanding the impact of climate change on Chagas disease epidemiology and contribute to modeling its future spread.
