There is evidence that Echinococcus granulosus (E.g) is susceptible to immune escape and tolerance when host expression of immunoinflammation and fibrosis is suppressed, accelerating the progression of hepatic cystic Echinococcosis (CE). Ghrelin has the effect of suppressing immunoinflammation and fibrosis, and whether it is involved in the regulation of CE progression is not clear. The present study demonstrated that Ghrelin is highly expressed in the early stage of hepatic E.g infection and may act mainly on hepatic stellate cells and T cells, exerting biological effects to inhibit Th1-type cellular immunity, the Myd88/NF-κB and TGF-β1/Smad3 pathways and agonize Th2-type cellular immunity, which in turn suppresses host expression of immunoinflammation and fibrosis. However, this biological effect of Ghrelin may regulate the progression of CE. [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6, as a Ghrelin receptor blocker, is expected to be a drug target against CE. In addition, we found protoscoleces of E.g with gene expression of Ghrelin, which also provides some evidence that Ghrelin regulates the disease progression of CE. Our study reveals the possible regulatory role and mechanism of Ghrelin in the process of hepatic E.g infection. In-depth studies could help to further unravel the disease mechanisms of CE and provide potential targets for therapy.
