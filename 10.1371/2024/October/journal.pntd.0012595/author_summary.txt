Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe hemorrhagic disease whose symptoms mimic those of other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), significantly challenging its differential diagnosis. Herein, we report on CCHF cases that were detected during the nationwide response activities against an outbreak of Sudan virus (SUDV) in Uganda, from September 2022 to January 2023. Confirmed CCHF cases, mainly males presenting with a range of clinical signs and symptoms, were identified in districts with circulating SUDV, including 4 cases identified within an Ebola treatment center at Mubende hospital, thus complicating patient management and treatment. Our findings highlight the need for broad testing for VHFs and other high-consequence pathogens, even during known VHF outbreaks, in order to identify high risk pathogens with outbreak potential, especially in countries with a broad range of endemic zoonotic viral pathogens. This article also adds to the known molecular epidemiology of CCHF virus in Uganda.
