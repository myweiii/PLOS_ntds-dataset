Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an inflammatory reaction that occurs in HIV/AIDS patients after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Along with immune system recovery, IRIS can overreact to existing infections or latent pathogens, causing symptoms that mimic those infections. The clinical characteristics of IRIS depend on the causative pathogen. Talaromycosis marneffei (TSM) is one of the common opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients, and often presents a disseminated form of infection, affecting multiple organs throughout the body. However, few reports on TSM-associated IRIS lead to challenges in clinical management. In this study, we carried out a retrospective analysis of TSM-associated IRIS, elucidated the occurrence and clinical features of TSM-associated IRIS, and compared the laboratory examination data and outcomes in TSM patients with or without IRIS. This study aims to review clinical data from HIV/AIDS patients with TSM to assess the frequency, features, and outcomes of TSM-associated IRIS, to improve understanding of the condition, and to facilitate clinical treatment effectively.
