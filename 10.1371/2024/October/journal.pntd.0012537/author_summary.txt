Our study aimed to validate the application of inertial sensors for patients with leprosy by establishing a correlation with the outcomes obtained from a force platform. Due to the disease’s impact on sensory perception and chronic pain in the plantar region, maintaining balance becomes challenging for affected individuals. Using a force platform and an inertial sensor, we evaluated balance in 30 leprosy patients and 30 healthy participants under Eyes Open and Eyes Closed conditions. Results revealed significantly higher values in balance parameters for the leprosy group compared to controls, indicating greater instability. The inertial sensor confirmed these differences, particularly in medio-lateral displacements and accelerations. While correlation between the platform and sensor varied, our study validated the sensor’s concurrent and clinical efficacy. This research underscores the potential of inertial sensors as reliable, cost-effective tools for assessing balance in clinical settings, especially for patients with multibacillary leprosy. Our findings contribute to enhancing public health efforts by offering practical solutions for monitoring and managing balance deficits in this neglected disease population.
