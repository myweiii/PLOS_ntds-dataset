The cost of treating and managing diarrhoea can place a burden on individuals, their households, and society in general. The cost is often undocumented, and many studies focus on children or hospitalised patients only. We estimated the cost borne per case of diarrhoea in Uvira, Democratic Republic of the Congo, by asking people with family members experiencing diarrhoea in the past 7 days about the costs they faced. Out of 2,820 members of the 528 households we interviewed overall, 175 people (6.2%) had diarrhoea in the previous 7 days. Most (64%) visited a pharmacy to seek care. The average economic cost per episode of diarrhoea was 33,816 Congolese Francs (CDF) (US$ 17.0) in 2021 prices, including both money spent out of pocket and indirect costs (e.g. lost caregiver or patient wages). The average out of pocket cost was CDF 15,579 (US$ 7.8). These costs could be avoided if diarrhoea were prevented through public health interventions to reduce prevalence and care-seeking was better managed to avert this public health burden.
