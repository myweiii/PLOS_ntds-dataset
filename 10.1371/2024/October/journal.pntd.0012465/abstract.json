    "Abstract": "Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), characterized by its high fatality rate, poses a significant public health concern in Argentina due to the increasing evidence of person-to-person transmission of Andes virus. Several orthohantaviruses were described in the country, but their phylogenetic relationships were inferred from partial genomic sequences. The objectives of this work were to assess the viral diversity of the most prevalent orthohantaviruses associated with HPS cases in the Central-East (CE) region of Argentina, elucidate the geographic patterns of distribution of each variant and reconstruct comprehensive phylogenetic relationships utilizing complete genomic sequencing. To accomplish this, a detailed analysis was conducted of the geographic distribution of reported cases within the most impacted province of the region. A representative sample of cases was then selected to generate a geographic map illustrating the distribution of viral variants. Complete viral genomes were obtained from HPS cases reported in the region, including some from epidemiologically linked cases. The phylogenetic analysis based on complete genomes defined two separate clades in Argentina: Andes virus in the Southwestern region and Andes-like viruses in other parts of the country. In the CE region, Buenos Aires virus and Lechiguanas virus clearly segregate in two subclades. Complete genomes were useful to distinguish person-to-person transmission from environmental co-exposure to rodent population. This study enhances the understanding of the genetic diversity, geographical spread, and transmission dynamics of orthohantaviruses in Central Argentina and prompt to consider the inclusion of Buenos Aires virus and Lechiguanas virus in the species Orthohantavirus andesense, as named viruses."
