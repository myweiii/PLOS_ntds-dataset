Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical parasitic disease that affects over 220 million people globally. Although there is a deworming mass drug administration (MDA) program for soil-transmitted helminths, the study area still needs to be integrated into the Praziquantel MDA. The study focused on school-age children to better understand the prevalence of the disease and recommend interventions. Hence, we assessed the prevalence and intensity of intestinal schistosomiasis among school-age children living in selected villages near Lake Chamo in the southern Rift Valley of Ethiopia. The results revealed that the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni was 52.3%. The overall prevalence of other intestinal parasites (Hymenolopis nana, Ascaris lumbricoides, Hookworm, Taenia species, Giardia lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica) was 7.7%. We documented a 5% S. mansoni co-infection with all other intestinal parasites including A. lumbricoides, H. nana, Taenia species, Hookworm, E. histolytica, and G. lamblia. This implies a high prevalence of intestinal parasites in school-age children, necessitating immediate action to alleviate this burden. Implementing school-based mass drug administration (MDA) for schistosomiasis is advisable in the study villages.
