The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a global public health threat, transmitting diseases like yellow fever, dengue, zika and Chikungunya, requiring several vector control strategies. Traditional methods such as active search and treatment of accessible breeding sites by control agents can be supplemented using PPF dissemination stations. The tactic uses adult mosquitoes themselves to disseminate the larvicide adhered to their bodies, between treated and untreated breeding sites, which are usually cryptic and inaccessible. This tactic can easily be incorporated into integrated vector management strategies, reducing the emergence of adult mosquitoes and, consequently, arboviruses transmission. However, its impact on Ae. aegypti genetic and population structure remain unknown. The PPF intervention caused a bottleneck in the genetic structure, an event in which a population undergoes a drastic reduction in population density, in this case due to the pressure caused by the larvicide, followed by reintroduction of adult mosquitoes from nearby areas not exposed to PPF. This study uses a cost-effective low-coverage whole genome sequencing method to analyze Ae. aegypti genetic population structure based on mitochondrial genome, comparing pre- and post-intervention periods with pyriproxyfen. This approach can reveal both short and long-term effects of this control strategy in the vector genome dynamics. These findings have direct implications for planning control activities, enhancing genomic surveillance and epidemiological surveillance, contributing to global efforts against vector-borne diseases.
