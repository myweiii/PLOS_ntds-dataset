Diarrheal disease is the second leading infectious cause of death among children under five worldwide; however, much is being done through interventions to improve conditions and reduce exposure to pathogens. Despite these efforts, little progress has been made on health outcomes. This study looks at an often-overlooked area in interventions, the public spaces in communities where children frequently play. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for pathogens and children were observed to understand frequency of risky behaviors that could lead to soil ingestion. This data was then fed into a statistical model to replicate thousands of instances of a child playing in a public space for one hour and found that the likelihood of pathogen exposure was high at about 70% with a greater than 30% chance of exposure to multiple pathogens in one instance. This has implications for how we plan interventions to include public spaces. It further serves as a methodologic model for combining site specific behavior and environmental data into a statistical model as a robust way to achieve pathogen exposure frequency and dose.
