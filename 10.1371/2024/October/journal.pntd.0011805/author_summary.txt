Tsetse flies (Glossina) transmit African trypanosomiasis in humans (‘sleeping sickness’) and livestock (‘nagana’). Quantifying the abundance, age structure, infection rates and host preferences of tsetse populations is important for designing and monitoring vector control operations. Tsetse were caught along the Kochi river in Koboko in N.W. Uganda. Age of tsetse was determined through ovarian ageing while dissection and PCR were both used for xenomonitoring. Feeding behaviour was inferred through bloodmeal analysis via sequence analysis.
Analyses of these results showed that natural mortality was low (1.75%/day) among adult females and seasonal variation in abundance and age structure was relatively slight. PCR proved significantly more sensitive as a xenomonitoring tool than the classical dissection method with positive rates of 1.6%, 2.4% and 2% for T. brucei sl, T. congolense and T. vivax, respectively. The most important hosts were cattle followed by humans which provided 39% and 37% of bloodmeals respectively.
The stable population in combination with a high rate of human blood feeding may help explain why this area has been a historic focus of sleeping sickness. The high proportion of bloodmeals from cattle suggest that insecticide treated cattle may prove to be an effective vector control strategy.
