Q fever (QF) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) are zoonotic diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans, causing health problems and economic losses in African countries. While various diagnostic tests for these diseases are available, they can be impractical, especially in resource-limited settings.
For this study, human and livestock samples from Chad were first tested in a local laboratory using a routine test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Serum aliquots were then sent to laboratories in Germany or Switzerland for retesting, using the same test type for livestock and a different test type for human samples.
We analysed the agreement between the test results and investigated the influence of the demographic characteristics of the sampled individual on this agreement. Our findings are crucial as they reveal discrepancies in test results, even though the samples originated from the same individuals. Additionally, we found that factors such as the age of the sampled individual influenced test agreement.
This study underscores the importance of considering sample conditions, test performance, and influencing factors when conducting and interpreting disease prevalence studies. Enhancing diagnostic procedures will aid in more effective disease control management, benefiting local communities and global health efforts.
