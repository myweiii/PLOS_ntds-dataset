Cryptosporidium parvum is a common protozoan pathogen responsible for moderate to severe diarrhea in young children and animals and there is currently no effective treatment to prevent the many deaths it causes each year. Previous studies showed that C. parvum genome encodes 22 insulinase-like M16 proteases (INSs) with diverse structures and sequences, suggesting that members of this protein family may have distinct biological functions in the life cycle of parasites. Our work characterizes two INSs, INS15 and INS16, which are encoded by neighboring genes with high sequence identity. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to endogenous tagged INS15 and INS16 and showed that expression patterns of INS15 and INS16 were different, with INS16 was not detected in the male gamonts. Genetic ablation of INS15 or INS16 affected late development of C. parvum in vitro, while only depletion of INS15 significantly reduced parasite burden in infected interferon-Î³ knockout mice. The INS15-depleted strain resulted on a reduction of clinical signs and an extension of survival time in infected mice compared to the INS15-tagged strain. These findings demonstrate that the depletion of INS15 attenuates the pathogenicity of this important zoonotic parasite.
