Nipah virus causes outbreaks of severe respiratory and neurological disease in Bangladesh and India. The majority of Nipah virus-infected patients succumb to the disease; survivors often suffer from lasting neurological consequences of infection. Although Nipah virus infection of the brain is thus an important component of Nipah virus disease, most studies to date have focused on the severe respiratory disease also caused by Nipah virus. In an attempt to develop a robust model to study Nipah virus neurological disease, we infected Syrian hamsters with Nipah virus by injecting the virus directly into the cerebellomedullary cistern in the brain. Animals quickly developed severe neurological disease requiring euthanasia and the virus could be detected at high levels in the brain, and lower levels in the lungs. Interestingly, the changes observed in the brains of infected animals were not the same as those observed in Syrian hamsters infected via other routes, nor those observed in human cases of Nipah virus infection in Malaysia, indicating that the inoculation route determines the course of disease in the brain.
