    "Background": "In 2007, the first outbreak of Chikungunya in Italy generated great alarm, highlighting the health risks caused by exotic species recently introduced in Europe and the need to strengthen control actions against the vectors. Besides health risks, mosquitoes cause nuisance, and citizens are required to adopt control measures. While the economic aspects of mosquito control by public agencies have been investigated, the scientific literature on the costs of mosquito protection incurred by families is scarce.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A phone questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data on the annual expenditure incurred by households for self-protection against mosquitos in relation to the perceived level of nuisance and the household and dwelling characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the main determinants influencing such expenditure, which resulted affected by dwelling characteristics, presence of children under 6 years of age, and health concerns of family members. The average annual household expenditure was estimated at 84.63 euros, about 30 times higher than the expenditure per household supported by regional and local administrations for interventions against mosquitoes in public areas, as calculated in a previous study.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Household expenditure is mainly aimed at providing a direct defense against mosquito bites (mosquito nets, adulticides, skin-on repellents, etc.) while spending for more effective measures addressed to reduce mosquito density results marginal: e.g., only 3.5% of the total expenditure was dedicated to larval control."
