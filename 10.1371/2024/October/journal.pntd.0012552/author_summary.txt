To achieve effectiveness, mosquito control requires the adoption of integrated pest management (IPM) methods and comprehensive strategies in both public and private areas.
In the case of urban mosquitoes, the application of IPM in public areas alone may not reduce the insect population density to levels that limit the nuisance, particularly during daytime, and mitigate the risks of arbovirus outbreaks.
In Italy, the control activities by local administrations are usually limited to public areas, while interventions in private areas are delegated to owners and residents. This study analyzed the expenses incurred by households to protect themselves from mosquitoes. We found that the average yearly cost per household was about € 84.63 (excluding the depreciation costs of mosquito nets, the average expenditure drops to € 58.63 per household), which was significantly higher than the average expenditure incurred by local administrations for their interventions in public areas (approximately € 3/household/year).
The efficacy of domestic mosquito control methods is difficult to estimate due to the variety of strategies, tools and operating conditions. Moreover, the application of domestic tools is mainly driven by marketing instead of sound cost-effectiveness evaluations.
