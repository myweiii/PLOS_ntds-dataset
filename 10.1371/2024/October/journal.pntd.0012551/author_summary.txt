In a comprehensive assessment conducted in the Gomma district of Jimma zone, Ethiopia, the community’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to rabies were assessed. While participants generally acknowledged domestic dogs and wild carnivores as the primary source of rabies and were able to identify various preventive measures such as avoiding dog bites and ensuring dog confinement, significant disparities were evident. Despite possessing a reasonable level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices were found to be inconsistent with effective rabies prevention. Notably, a prevalent belief persisted among participants that rabies could be cured through traditional herbal medicine, indicating a misconception regarding the disease’s treatment. Additionally, a troubling trend emerged where animals involved in bite incidents were often killed instead of being quarantined, contrary to established guidelines. Recognizing the urgent need for intervention, the study emphasizes the critical role of enhancing awareness and promoting culturally and gender-sensitive educational programs. These initiatives should aim to rectify misconceptions, improve first aid practices, and foster appropriate healthcare-seeking behaviors among community members and healthcare providers alike. By implementing these multifaceted strategies, communities can work towards achieving a significant reduction in the burden of rabies and safeguarding public health.
