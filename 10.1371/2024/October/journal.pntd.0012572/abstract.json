    "Background": "Mycetoma is an uncommon and neglected tropical disease in Uganda. We aimed to assess baseline knowledge and provide community health workers (CHWs) in Northern Uganda with knowledge to identify and refer presumptive mycetoma cases.",
    "Methodology": "Between March and August 2023, we conducted a concurrent triangulation mixed methods study among CHWs in Gulu and Pader districts on mycetoma. We conducted a 1 day in person training on mycetoma. Quantitative data were collected before (pretest), immediately (immediate posttest) and six months (6-month posttest) after the training and results compared using paired sample t test or one-way ANOVA. Qualitative data were collected using four focused group discussions, audio recorded, and analyzed using thematic content analysis.",
    "Principal findings": "Forty-five CHWs were enrolled, mostly male (66.7%, n = 30), with a median age of 36 years (IQR 29 43). Out of a total score of 18, the baseline mean knowledge score was 7\u00b12.42, improving to 11\u00b11.99 immediately posttest (p<0.001), and 10\u00b12.35 at 6 months (p<0.001), without additional training. Significant knowledge improvements at 6 months were observed among female participants (p = 0.004), those aged 30 40 years (p = 0.031) or 40+ years (p = 0.035), and those with secondary education (p = 0.007). Over 6 months, CHWs screened 2,773 adults, identifying and referring 30 presumptive mycetoma cases. Qualitative findings revealed challenges and barriers to early identification and referral of mycetoma presumptive cases including limited knowledge, stigma, myths, lack of an indigenous name for mycetoma, delayed decision making, and transportation barriers.",
    "Conclusions": "This study highlights a significant knowledge gap among CHWs about mycetoma, with substantial improvement following training. The identification of presumptive cases by CHWs reflects their potential in community-based surveillance, emphasizing the need to integrate well-trained CHW to lead efforts for mycetoma surveillance and capacity building to enhance health outcomes in Uganda."
