    "Background": "In areas of low disease endemicity, highly sensitive diagnostic tools to identify, diagnose, and monitor intestinal schistosomiasis transmission are needed to reliably measure the burden and risk of infection. Here, we used highly sensitive molecular diagnostic methods to investigate Schistosoma mansoni prevalence and transmission along the southern shoreline of Lake Malawi, five years post-disease outbreak.",
    "Methodology and principal findings": "Faecal and urine samples were provided by school-aged children situated along the southern shoreline of Lake Malawi. Kato-Katz faecal-egg microscopy and point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) rapid diagnostic tests were then performed to diagnose infection with S. mansoni. Urine-egg microscopy was also used to diagnose infection with Schistosoma haematobium. In addition, Schistosoma miracidia were isolated from faecal material using a standard miracidium hatching technique. A two-step real-time PCR approach was then used to diagnose infection with S. mansoni using DNA isolated from faecal samples. Furthermore, isolated miracidia were genotyped to species level through PCR and Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses were then carried out to identify which previously defined S. mansoni cox1 lineage group S. mansoni miracidia were most closely related to.",
    "Conclusions and significance": "Intestinal schistosomiasis is now highly prevalent along the southern shoreline of Lake Malawi just five years post-disease outbreak. In addition, a high prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis persists. The revision of ongoing schistosomiasis control programmes in this area is therefore recommended. Our study also highlights the need for reliable diagnostic assays capable of distinguishing between Schistosoma species in multispecies co-endemic areas."
