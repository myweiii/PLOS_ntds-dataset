Tick-borne rickettsial diseases caused by spotted fever group rickettsia (SFGR) are natural zoonotic diseases that seriously threaten human health worldwide, which mainly transmitted to humans and animals by tick bites.
This is the first study systematically examined the distribution of tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsia (SFGR) in China. To analyze the positive rates of tick-borne SFGR in China, we conducted a meta-analysis of 57 studies reporting 39,380 ticks that were published in Chinese and English between 2000 and 2022. Setting the Qinling Mountains-Huaihe River Line as the boundary between northern and southern China, the main tick species in China are D. silvarum, I. persulcatus and H. Iongicornis, and the common SFGR species they carry are R. raoultii, R. heilongjiangiensis, and some unclassified species. The findings highlight awareness of future tick-borne disease prevention and control strategies, such as vaccination programs and public awareness campaigns.
