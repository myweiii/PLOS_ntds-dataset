Schistosomiasis, which seriously threatens human health, is the worldâ€™s second largest tropical disease caused by schistosome infection. Praziquantel has many problems such as side effects and drug resistance, so it is urgent to develop new prevention strategies. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens has been reported to alleviate the pathological damage of intestinal diseases, which can be used as a potential strategy to alleviate granuloma and fibrosis induced by schistosomiasis japonica in intestine and liver. However, the mechanism of B. amyloliquefaciens regulating schistosomiasis japonica through the mediation of intestinal microbiome is still unclear. In this study, we conducted joint analysis of the gut microbiome and host serum metabolites through mouse models and multi-omics sequencing technology, and found that the intragastric administration of B. amyloliquefaciens could regulate the restoration of intestinal microbiome and the secretion of metabolites derived from intestinal microbiome in mice, improve lipid metabolism disorder and hormone secretion in mice, and ultimately reduce the pathological response of mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum. This study highlights the crosstalk between intestinal microbiome and the host, providing an important reference for the precise treatment based on targeted microbiota, and also providing a new strategy for the prevention and adjuvant treatment of schistosomiasis japonica.
