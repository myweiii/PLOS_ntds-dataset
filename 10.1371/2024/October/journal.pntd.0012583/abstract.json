    "Background": "Schistosomiasis japonica is a serious threat to human health. It causes damage to the intestine and liver. Probiotic therapy has been shown to be effective in alleviating intestinal diseases and improving host health. Previous studies have found that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens could alleviate the pathological symptoms of schistosomiasis japonica, but the regulatory mechanism of alleviating schistosomiasis japonica is still unknown.",
    "Principal findings": "This study analyzed the dynamic changes of intestinal microbiome in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum after the intervention of B. amyloliquefaciens and its connection to host metabolism by multi-omics sequencing technology. B. amyloliquefaciens was found to significantly regulate the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibiting potential pathogenic bacteria and protect the number of core microbes. Meanwhile, the genes related to the metabolism of glycerophospholipids and amino acid from intestinal microbiome changed significantly, and were shown to be significantly positively correlated with the associated metabolites of microbial origin. Moreover, host metabolism (lipid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis) was also found to be significantly regulated.",
    "Conclusions": "The recovery of intestinal microbial homeostasis and the regulation of host metabolism revealed the potential probiotic properties of B. amyloliquefaciens, which also provided new ideas for the prevention and adjuvant treatment of schistosomiasis japonica."
