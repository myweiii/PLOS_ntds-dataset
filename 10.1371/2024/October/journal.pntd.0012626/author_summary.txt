Aedes albopictus mosquitoes can survive in temperate climates because females are able to detect changes in temperature and day length in the autumn to produce “diapause” eggs that are provisioned with extra nutrients to survive harsh winters by remaining in a state of arrest and hatching in the spring. Although temperature and day length normally change in concert with each other throughout the year, studies have shown that day length is the most important cue used by female mosquitoes to initiate diapause egg production. In this study, the authors examined aspects of feeding and reproduction to determine which of these correlated with day length. Many aspects of reproduction were influenced by temperature; however, housing female mosquitoes under autumn-like short-day conditions led to increased starvation resistance. Surprisingly these females survive longer even though they do not appear to expend less energy compared to females housed in spring-like long-day conditions at the same temperature. This suggests that the mosquito mothers undergo changes in their metabolism that correlate with the production of DP eggs that can survive the winter. This new knowledge may lead to novel targets to disrupt seasonal reproduction in mosquitoes and limit the parts of the world where they can survive.
