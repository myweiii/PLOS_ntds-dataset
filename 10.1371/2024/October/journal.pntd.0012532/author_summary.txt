Strongyloidiasis, a parasitic infection affecting over 600 million people worldwide, is increasingly recognized in global health initiatives. Caused by the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, it predominantly occurs in tropical and subtropical regions. Transmission results through contact with soil contaminated by infectious larvae, leading to a spectrum of clinical symptoms from mild gastrointestinal discomfort to potentially life-threatening complications, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems. Despite its designation as a neglected tropical disease, concerns regarding the development of drug resistance highlight the need to explore alternative treatment strategies. In our study, we employed innovative methods to evaluate the in vitro efficacy of various drug candidates against Strongyloides ratti larvae, representing a crucial step in identifying novel therapies for human strongyloidiasis. Our findings revealed that some of the novel compounds tested, showed superior efficacy in inhibiting parasite motility, suggesting potential benefits for patient treatment outcomes. Our study underscores the urgent need for diversified treatment approaches in combating strongyloidiasis.
