Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bpm) is an intracellular pathogen and is the etiological agent of melioidosis. This neglected tropical disease results in an estimated 89,000 fatalities a year, however, this number is believed to be severely underreported. The complex intracellular lifestyle and host response to infection is poorly understood, basic cell interactions and responses are critical to defense against infection. Bpm utilizes an array of virulence factors to successfully replicate and disseminate cell-to-cell, one of these is the T6SS which is responsible for MNGC formation and cell-to-cell spread. In this work, we characterized how macrophages respond to infection in the presence or absence of the critical T6SS virulence factor. Macrophages are a primary replicative niche for Bpm but how intracellular replication disrupts macrophages response to infection is poorly understood. By understanding macrophage cell death patterns and polarization, we can dissect responses that are triggered by T6SS activity with the expectation of finding exploitable responses for host directed therapies.
