Schistosomiasis continues to be a major global health problem, affecting millions of people worldwide. One of the human pathogens, Schistosoma mansoni, was introduced to the Americas from Africa during the transatlantic slave trade. Despite its widespread distribution, intraspecific variation between geographically separated strains of S. mansoni has been studied insufficiently. Our study provides a comparative analysis of three laboratory S. mansoni strains with original provenance from Liberia, Belo Horizonte and Puerto Rico. We found significant intraspecific differences in virulence patterns, host immune responses and organ pathology. Our results show differences in the phenotypic characteristics of the parasite and its eggs. The Puerto Rican strain was the most virulent and was characterized by severe liver and spleen damage and advanced liver fibrosis. In contrast, the strains from Liberia and Belo Horizonte were less pathogenic and showed only minimal liver fibrosis. In addition, we observed significant differences in granuloma formation, cytokine expression and T-cell dynamics, indicating different host immune responses. These different virulence patterns and immune responses highlight the need to consider the intraspecific variation of S. mansoni when assessing disease burden and developing new therapeutic approaches.
