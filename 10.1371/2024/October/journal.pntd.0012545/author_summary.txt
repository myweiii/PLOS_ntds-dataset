C. sinensis infection is closely related to the occurrence of CCA, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified C. sinensis as a class I carcinogen. The exact mechanism of C. sinensis causing CCA remains to be elucidated, which may be the result of the synergistic effect of multiple factors such as mechanical damage caused by the migration of C. sinensis adult worms, secondary bacterial infection and inflammatory response, toxicity of the excretory-secretory products, abnormal host immune response and gene mutations. Recently, extracellular vesicles have emerged as a potential mechanism participating in parasite-host interaction, and CsEVs may play an important role in the pathogenesis and carcinogenesis of C. sinensis. In this study, it was discovered that EVs isolated from the culture supernatant of C. sinensis adult worms could facilitate the abnormal proliferation of CCA cells by regulating cell cycle progression, and promote the migration, invasion and EMT process through activating the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Furthermore, the protein expression profile of CsEVs is revealed by this study, which provides a new perspective for the study of liver fluke-associated CCA and may therefore contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat CCA caused by C. sinensis infection.
