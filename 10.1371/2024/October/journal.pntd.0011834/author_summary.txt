Diarrhoeal diseases remain a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income nations, and understanding the environmental factors that influence their occurrence is crucial for effective prevention and management strategies. Here, we study the weather factors, such as temperature and precipitation, that could influence the prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in children. We found that higher temperatures were associated with an increased risk of diarrhoea in some regions. Increased precipitation was associated with a higher incidence of diarrhoea in some sites. In certain sites, diarrhoeal cases decreased with rising temperatures and precipitation. These findings offer insights into the climate and geographic patterns of childhood diarrhoea, which are essential for developing targeted and efficient public health interventions. Recognizing the significant role of weather-related variables in driving child diarrhoea, it is imperative to identify the conditions associated with these patterns to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between environmental factors and disease prevalence.
