The diagnosis of tropical or neglected infectious diseases, such as leprosy, is highly dependent on techniques that are not very sensitive or very laborious, such as optical microscopy or culture. More sensitive and specific molecular tests are only available in urban centers, where there is a specialized workforce and adequate infrastructure. However, a large portion of the population does not have access to such medical services, either due to financial or distance issues. Thus, performing diagnostic tests at the point of care (POC) provides agility in diagnosis, avoiding the need for patients to travel to medical centers or transport biological samples to clinical analysis centers, ensuring that this population has access to diagnostic tests, even in remote areas or with poor infrastructure.
In this work, we optimize and validate, on a laboratory scale, simplified versions of all the procedures necessary to perform molecular tests, from collection and DNA extraction to the detection of genomic targets using portable qPCR equipment. The results presented here are the basis of a novel tool with potential to increase a leprosy screening test in remote areas, facilitating the active search of positive cases and monitoring by health authorities responsible for underserved populations.
