    "Abstract": "The study aimed to optimize qPCR reactions using oligonucleotides from the first Brazilian molecular diagnostic kit for leprosy on a portable platform (Q3-Plus). In addition, we sought to develop a simplified protocol for DNA extraction that met point-of-care criteria. During optimization on the Q3-Plus, optical parameters, thresholds, and cutoffs for the 16S rRNA and RLEP targets of M. leprae were established using synthetic DNA, purified DNA from M. leprae, and pre-characterized clinical samples. For the simplified extraction protocol, different lysis solutions were evaluated using chaotropic agents, and purification was carried out by transferring the lysed material to FTA cards. The complete protocol (simplified extraction + qPCR on the portable platform) was then evaluated with pre-characterized clinical skin biopsy samples and compared with standard equipment (QuantStudio-5). LOD95% for the optimized reactions was 113.31 genome-equivalents/\u03bcL for 16S rRNA and 17.70 genome-equivalents/\u03bcL for RLEP. Among the lysis solutions, the best-performing was composed of urea (2 M), which provided good dissolution of the skin fragment and a lower Ct value, indicating higher concentrations of DNA. The complete technological solution showed a sensitivity of 52% in reactions. Our results highlight the need for additional optimization to deal with paucibacillary samples, but also demonstrate the feasibility of the portable platform for the qPCR detection of M. leprae DNA in low infrastructure settings."
