Our study compares two methods of monitoring tuberculosis treatment: Video-observed therapy (VOT) and directly observed therapy (DOT). Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that requires strict adherence to treatment, and traditionally, healthcare workers physically observe patients taking their medication (DOT). However, this can be time-consuming and costly. VOT, where patients are observed via video, has emerged as a possible alternative.
In this systematic review, we evaluated how VOT and DOT compare in terms of patient adherence, the costs associated with treatment observation, the time required to observe treatment, and patient satisfaction. We found that VOT generally leads to similar or better adherence compared to DOT, while also being more cost-effective and time-efficient. Patients also reported higher satisfaction with VOT, likely due to its convenience and flexibility. Our findings suggest that VOT could be a valuable tool in improving tuberculosis treatment outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings.
