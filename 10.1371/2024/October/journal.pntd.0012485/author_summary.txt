The coexistence of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) and mutualistic gut microbes in the gastrointestinal tract is poorly understood. We studied the gut microbiome in Ethiopian school children infected and non-infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). We found that children infected with Trichuris trichiura showed significantly lower microbial diversity. Comparing microbial taxa at the genus level, we observed a significant increase in Agathobacter relative abundance among children infected with Trichuris trichiura compared to non-infected subjects. These findings indicate that the gut microbiome composition may vary depending on the species of helminth present. Further research is needed to understand how Trichuris trichiura selectively alters the gut microbiome compared to other STH species. Data on soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) and their relationship to the microbiome would be valuable for planning future public health interventions. This is particularly important for controlling helminth infections while considering the microbial community.
