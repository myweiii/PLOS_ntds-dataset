    "Background": "Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) and mutualistic gut microbes coexist in the gastrointestinal tract. However, limited data exist regarding how STH infections are associated with gut microbiome profiles.",
    "Method": "We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data collected in a longitudinal study to identify and explain differences in microbial communities between STH-infected and non-infected Ethiopian school children. We collected 138 stool samples and analyzed them for STH infection using standard direct wet mount and Kato Katz methods. The gut microbiome profiles were characterized using targeted amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from the total DNA extracted from the stools.",
    "Results": "Children infected with Trichuris trichiura showed significantly lower microbial diversity than those who were non-infected (p<0.05). We also observed significant difference in microbiome composition based on Trichuris trichiura infection status (PERMANOVA p< 0.01). A comparison of microbial taxa at the genus level among participants infected with different helminth species showed a significant increase in Agathobacter relative abundance among children infected with Trichuris trichiura compared to non-infected subjects (adjusted p = 0.001).",
    "Conclusions": "Our results indicate that changes in the gut microbiome composition may vary depending on the species of helminth present. Further studies should investigate how Trichuris trichiura selectively alters microbiome composition compared to other STH species."
