Onchocerciasis is a common neglected tropical disease with serious consequences in Ethiopia. Mass drug administration and behavioral changes in the community are being used for its control and eventual eradication, but community awareness, perceptions, and practices are still underreported. This study examined community knowledge, perceptions and preventive practices towards Onchocerciasis using mixed method in Jimma, Ethiopia. The finding revealed that, most of the respondents were familiar with Onchocerciasis, despite some confusions and misinterpretations around it. In these communities where Onchocerciasis is endemic, correct perceptions and proper understanding of this disease was inadequate and the level of risk perception towards Onchocerciasis was quite low. On the other hand, more than half of the participants did not practice Onchocerciasis recommended preventive measures and lack adequate knowledge of it. Furthermore, participants who were knowledgeable about the mode of transmission, its consequences and preventive measures were more likely to practice its preventive measures. Thus, our findings highlight the need for strengthening context-specific and tailored behavior change communications by integrating it into routine Onchocerciasis control and elimination program.
