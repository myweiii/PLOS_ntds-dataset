Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease transmitted by arthropods that affects mammals, including humans, leading to skin ulcers that can be disfiguring, weakness, and inflammatory states in the individual. This disease impacts on global public health, affecting vulnerable communities, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions endemic to this condition. Research related to cutaneous leishmaniasis not only enables the development of more effective prevention strategies or treatments but also contributes to the exploration of new therapeutic options. This investigation focuses on identifying the parasite species causing the disease in military patients in Colombia, describing how an individual may be infected by one or more species and how the populations of microorganisms (prokaryotes and eukaryotes) present on the skin are affected by the parasiteâ€™s presence. Some of these microorganisms have been linked to the exacerbation or improvement of other skin diseases, opening doors to new fields of study related to the illness.
