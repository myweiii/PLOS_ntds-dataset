In this study, 13 cases of ST were identified through clinical and laboratory diagnosis in Rongjiang County, which is the first outbreak of the disease in Guizhou province, China. It is worth noting that ST was caused by the Karp strain, which can be transmitted by wild mice, and the infected population generally had a clear history of outdoor activity. In addition to the typical clinical symptoms such as fever, chills and pneumonia, nearly half of patients with ST also exhibited abnormal electrocardiogram activity. In conclusion, our study presents a method to confirm ST through the combination of clinical and laboratory diagnosis, which provides a reference for the development of effective strategies and measures to tackle ST, and has important public health significance.
