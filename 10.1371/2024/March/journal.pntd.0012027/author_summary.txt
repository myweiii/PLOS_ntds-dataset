Human myiasis is a neglected tropical disease in the world especially in SSA. Human myiasis in SSA has infects patients from all dynamics especially those with underlying health issues like primary wounds. The disease can be fatal especially when it involves heavy infestation of the scalp (migratory myiasis) among young children. Subcutaneous myiasis of the eye and genitals can be devastating for patients and can lead to damage in these areas if the disease is misdiagnosed and larvae removal is delayed. The findings and recommendations in our study can be used by government officials in SSA to provide hospitals with state-of-the-art diagnostic tools, trained entomologists, and research funding to comprehensively study human myiasis. Public health officers at entry points in SSA should inform international travelers about the risk factors of the disease and common preventive measures. Clinicians in SSA should report more human myiasis cases to enable researchers to estimate the epidemiology and prevalence of the disease. The natives of SSA should be enlighten more on the symptoms and risk factors of the disease and encourage them to report to health facilities when they experience these symptoms.
