After the ZIKV epidemic in the Americas, it remains unclear if and when a resurgence of the ZIKV could occur. We used publicly available data on environmental suitability of transmission as well as seroprevalence data to estimate future vulnerability to ZIKV outbreaks. Our results show a considerable discrepancy between the observed seroprevalence, from past exposure to the virus on one hand, and the environmental suitability, which raised the question why the epidemic subsided before reaching the expected herd immunization threshold in many locations. This lack of understanding also highlights that future ZIKV outbreaks currently cannot be predicted with confidence. Although we cannot provide an answer to the question why the epidemic subsided when it did, we present a better quantification and geospatial mapping of the potential vulnerability to future outbreaks, which will be crucial for decision makers to prepare for future outbreaks.
