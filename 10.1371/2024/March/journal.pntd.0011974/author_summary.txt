Individuals with animal hoarding disorder (AHD), a psychiatric obsessive-compulsive disorder, are considered among the most vulnerable people due to their precarious sanitary conditions and exposure to several zoonoses, including canine brucellosis, a neglected and underreported disease of public health concern worldwide. Close and continuous human contact with unhealthy and unassisted dogs may increase pathogen transmission and spread, which is worsened by elderly peopleâ€™s difficulty accessing health services and lack of hoarding control and management programs. The present study assessed B. canis as a silent pathogen in this hard-to-access vulnerable population, along with their dogs. Although all the individuals with AHD included herein were seronegative and their dogs presented relatively low seroprevalence, B. canis infection and outbreaks should always be considered, particularly due to unsanitary household conditions, the high density of dog populations, and the constant introduction of susceptible dogs of unknown origin. Thus, dogs seropositive for B. canis living in households of people with AHD should be considered a warning to local public health authorities. In conclusion, serological and molecular assessments of B. canis in people with AHD and other vulnerable populations may serve as instruments for effective public health policies, including diagnosis, control, monitoring, and prevention.
