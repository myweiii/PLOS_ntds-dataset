Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) circulation has been causing large epidemics throughout the tropics and subtropics, affecting the quality of life of the global population. Additionally, the asymptomatic or subclinical case numbers are unclear due to a paucity of epidemiological studies. Since 2013, CHIKV epidemics have been spreading in the Americas, and more than 900,000 CHIKV infection cases were confirmed in Brazil in 2020. In São José do Rio Preto (SJdRP), only 41 cases of CHIKV infection were confirmed from 2015–2020, according to official bulletins. In the same period, our study revealed seven participants among 340 (2.05%) who seroconverted to anti-CHIKV IgG, while in a blood panel collected during a dengue outbreak, 22 samples among 497 (4.42%) had anti-CHIKV IgM. These results demonstrate that the cryptic CHIKV circulation in SJdRP and the high percentage of naive individuals could represent an imminent risk of outbreaks. Additionally, our data might assist public health authorities in the development of health measures for epidemiological and vector surveillance programs.
