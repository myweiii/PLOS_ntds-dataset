In areas where many people have onchocerciasis, a parasitic infection spread by female blackflies, there is often a high occurrence of epilepsy. The latter includes nodding syndrome (NS), a type of epilepsy where the head repeatedly drops forward. This is the case in Mvolo County, South Sudan. Our study examined how the annual intake of ivermectin, a drug that prevents onchocerciasis, impacted the occurrence of new epilepsy cases, including NS, in the county. In June 2020, we visited selected sites and screened 15,480 individuals for epilepsy, with confirmation of diagnosis by a medical professional. This exercise was repeated in June 2022 with 15,092 individuals. We found fewer new epilepsy and probable NS cases after introducing annual ivermectin treatment. Still, not all eligible community members received the treatment, with 64% of participants reporting taking ivermectin in 2019 and only 24% in 2021. Our research further corroborates that ivermectin intake at the community level can help reduce the high number of epilepsy and NS cases in regions where onchocerciasis is found. Consequently, it is imperative that individuals at risk for onchocerciasis, particularly those within the 5â€“18-year-old age group, who are most susceptible to developing onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy, have access to annual ivermectin.
