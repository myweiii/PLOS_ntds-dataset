Envenomings caused by Bothrops species are a public health problem in the Brazilian Amazon. These envenomings can lead to a renal clinical complication called acute kidney injury. A better understanding of the causes leading to this complication is crucial for patient care. We aimed to describe the protein profile in the urine of patients who suffered envenoming and developed acute kidney injury. For this, we used large-scale analysis methods to compare the urine protein content of three groups of samples: healthy individuals, and snakebite patients with and without acute kidney injury. We identified a total of 1190 proteins, 65 of which were exclusive to patients suffering from snake bite envenoming. For patients with a kidney injury outcome, 32 unique proteins were found, of which the most abundant were associated with the bodyâ€™s inflammatory response. We highlight 4 proteins, including serotransferrin and SERPINA-1. Furthermore, we also evaluated candidate biomarkers of kidney injury already reported in the literature, such as retinol-binding protein, cystatin-C, and hepcidin, concluding that they are significant in cases of kidney injury caused by a jararaca snakebite. This work can help to better understand this serious complication that threatens the lives of the population living in the Amazon.
