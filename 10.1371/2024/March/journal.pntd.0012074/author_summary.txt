Seoul orthohantavirus is a rat-borne zoonotic virus that can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans worldwide while it generally leads to persistent infection in absence of clinical signs in the natural reservoir host, the Norway rat. It is believed that persistent infection in reservoir hosts is due to downregulation of pro-inflammatory immune responses and upregulation of regulatory responses, while in humans excessive immune responses contribute to disease. Endothelial cells in the lungs are of particular interest as they represent a primary target during Seoul orthohantavirus infection in both species. So far, it remains incompletely understood how the responses of these cells to Seoul orthohantavirus contribute to the development of disease in humans and the prevention of such in rats. In this study, we compared the host responses of human and rat lung endothelial cells to Seoul orthohantavirus infection and found that anti-viral responses from both species are comparable, but differ in timing. Additionally, we identified a novel protein interaction network during later phases of acute infection in rat cells, which may play a crucial role in the development of disease in humans and persistence in rodents.
