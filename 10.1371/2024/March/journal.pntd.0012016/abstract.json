    "Abstract": "Bolivia has the highest incidence of Chagas disease (CD) worldwide. Caused by the parasite Trypanasoma cruzi, CD is generally a chronic condition. Diagnosis is logistically and financially challenging, requiring at least two different laboratory-based serological tests. Many CD cases are missed; in Bolivia it is estimated just 6% of individuals chronically infected with T. cruzi get diagnosed. Achieving control on the way to elimination of CD requires a radical simplification of the current CD testing pathways, to overcome the barriers to accessing CD treatment. We aimed to generate unbiased performance data of lateral flow assays (LFAs) for T. cruzi infection in Bolivia, to evaluate their usefulness for improving T. cruzi diagnosis rates in a precise and efficient manner."
