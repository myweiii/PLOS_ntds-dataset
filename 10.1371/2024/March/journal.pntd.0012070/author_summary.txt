Trimeresurus gracilis is a protected pit viper species endemic to the mid-to-high-altitude mountainous areas of Taiwan. Due to the lack of a serum specifically targeting T. gracilis envenomation, patients bitten by this species currently receive treatment by employing a bivalent antivenom developed against T. stejnegeri and P. mucrosquamatus, which is believed to potentially possess cross-neutralizing effects. However, the use of the bivalent antivenom has demonstrated limited effectiveness in neutralizing local effects in patients. In response, we conducted investigations into the in vitro immunological reactivity and in vivo neutralization of T. gracilis venom using antivenoms developed against four pit viper species. Our results indicate that the bivalent antivenom was not completely effective in neutralizing T. gracilis venom. Instead, the monovalent antivenom for Gloydius brevicaudus exhibited higher in vitro binding capacities toward T. gracilis venom compared with other antivenoms. These findings may be attributed to a closer phylogenetic relationship between T. gracilis and G. brevicaudus. Furthermore, these observations have the potential to contribute to the development of more effective antivenoms, offering valuable insights for the community focused on neglected tropical diseases.
