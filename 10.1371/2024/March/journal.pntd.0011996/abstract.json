{
    "Background": "Understanding the barriers to and facilitators of participation in research could enhance recruitment rates for biomedical research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) and help to avoid the problems associated with poor recruitment.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "We conducted a systematic review to identify factors related to willingness to participate in biomedical research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). Our search included the following databases: Medline/PubMed, Embase (Embase.com), Global Index Medicus (WHO), Web of Science (Core collection), and gray literature. We included studies that analyzed or reported factors associated with willingness to participate in NTD research, using either quantitative methods (such as clinical trials, cohorts, and cross-sectional studies) or qualitative methods (such as focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and in-depth interviews). There were no language restrictions, but we excluded review articles, notes, case reports, letters to the editor, editor\u2019s notes, extended abstracts, proceedings, patents, editorials, and other editorial materials.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "This systematic review provides recommendations for improving adherence to biomedical research on Neglected Tropical Diseases, which can be applied in practice."
