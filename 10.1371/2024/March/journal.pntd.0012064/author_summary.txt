Despite effective animal and human vaccines, rabies causes over 59,000 human deaths annually, mainly in children and in poor rural communities in Asia and Africa. World Health Organization and partners have recently launched the “Zero by 30” global plan which aims to end human deaths by dog-mediated rabies by 2030 by raising awareness, increasing access to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and mass dog vaccination.
In Madagascar, where rabies is endemic, a network of anti-rabies treatment centers (ARTC) delivers free-of-charge vaccines to exposed patients. As little is known on rabies awareness in Malagasy communities, we set up quantitative and qualitative surveys on rabies knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP).
Results showed that major hosts, main transmission routes, clinical signs and outcomes were known by most respondents. Yet knowledge on the existence of ARTC, the usefulness and availability of PEP, usefulness of confining and monitoring biting dogs was very low. Although bite incidence was lower, remote rural areas had more limited knowledge, poorer practices on rabies and extremely low dog vaccination coverage, so awareness campaigns should make sure remote rural populations are reached. If these campaigns are likely to succeed in improving access to ARTCs, their impact on dog vaccination seems more uncertain. Therefore, to reach dog vaccination coverage goals, the center-piece of rabies elimination strategies, awareness campaigns must be combined with free-of-charge mass dog vaccination.
