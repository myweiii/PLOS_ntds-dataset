Loiasis remains highly neglected despite recent evidence of significant loiasis-associated mortality and morbidity. This complex disease is difficult to diagnose, especially in endemic populations. Here, we assessed the performance of several diagnostic assays. In addition, an exploratory analysis of factors associated with the outcomes of indirect, serology-based tests was performed. The presented data show only moderate performance of indirect tests. Furthermore, amicrofilaremic loiasis was associated with higher quantitative serological test results. None of the indirect tests detected all cases of microfilaremic loiasis, including individuals with high and hyper-microfilaremia. As a negative test may not reliably exclude hyper-microfilaremic infections, these serological tests should not be used as screening tests in individual case management. This is important, as hyper-microfilaremic individuals are at increased risk of developing serious adverse events after treatment with drugs such as ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine.
