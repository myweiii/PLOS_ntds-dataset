Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is common in low- and middle-income country children with an incidence of up to 30% in some populations. SIBO has been documented as early as 18 weeks of age using the glucose-hydrogen breath test. SIBO is associated with future linear growth shortfalls and decreased language scores on neurodevelopmental testing. Other studies have linked SIBO to enteric inflammation but no work has directly examined histologic associations with the hydrogen breath test. Further, no work linking the duodenal adherent microbiota to breath testing has been published to date.
We conducted glucose-hydrogen breath testing and duodenoscopy with biopsy on Bangladeshi toddlers. Biopsy samples were subject to both histological scoring and 16s rRNA sequencing. SIBO was associated with enterocyte injury and with a significant increase in Campylobacter species in biopsy samples. These findings support the growing body of literature showing an association between SIBO and enteric inflammation and enterocyte injury. Further, they show a novel association between SIBO and Campylobacter species.
