Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) caused by Schistosoma haematobium affects mostly the reproductive tract of girls and women in rural and marginalized communities. This disease has been largely neglected by the schistosomiasis endemic communities and public health professionals. The present review aimed at assessing the evidence/epidemiology of FGS among women/girls in Tanzania.
Furthermore, the review assessed the availability of information, published literature on FGS including comorbidities that address FGS in Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar islands. The evidence generated was important to inform the need to address FGS key gaps among researchers, healthcare workers and communities. Overall, the findings indicated that the knowledge of FGS was lacking among the endemic communities and healthcare workers. Findings from this review have shown the available gaps in literature on FGS in Tanzania, from very few community-and-hospitals based studies reported from mainland Tanzania, and Zanzibar. To address this gap, further research is essential to understanding the true burden of disease-associated morbidity, to assessing the impact of single dose praziquantel in FGS lesions, to understanding mental health in relation to FGS, and to integrating delivery of FGS related services in primary health care systems.
