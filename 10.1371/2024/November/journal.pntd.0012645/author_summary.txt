IBD encompasses Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. It affects both children and adults. Reports have highlighted the potential use of helminths or their byproducts as a possible treatment for IBD. Accumulating evidence also suggests that the gut microbiota is a key factor in modulating IBD. In this study, we revealed the protective effect of a prior infection with T. spiralis on DSS- induced colitis in mice. Specifically, T. spiralis infection reshaped the gut microbiome of mice, resulting in an increased abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria Muribaculum and unclassified_Muribaculaceae and thereby producing a larger amount of propionic acid. Furthermore, the gut microbiome modulated by T. spiralis exhibited enhanced goblet cell differentiation and elevated IL-10 levels, ultimately ameliorating experimental colitis. These findings suggest that the modulation of host microbiota during T. spiralis infection plays a crucial role in the suppression of colitis, and any intention-to-treat with helminth therapy should be based on the patient’s immunological and microbiological response to the helminth.
