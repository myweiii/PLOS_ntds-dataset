As a globally distributed obligate bloodthirsty ectoparasite, ticks are the vector second only to mosquitoes, capable of transmitting a variety of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and protozoa to humans, livestock, and wildlife. Illegal poaching and smuggling pose a serious threat to the survival of pangolins and are also a potential route for the spread of tick-borne diseases. The present study was conducted to investigate the reasons for the unexpected death of Malayan pangolins confiscated in 2021, as well as to explore the potential pathogens that may be transmitted during smuggling. Based on the clinical symptoms, autopsy, and molecular detection results, we speculate that the primary cause was the spotted fever triggered by Rickettsia spp. from A. javanense, which accelerated the death of smuggled pangolins. Ehrlichia sp. or Babesia sp. infection might be associated with the death of a few pangolins. Moreover, A. javanense carrying Colpodella spp. were detected for the first time in Malayan pangolins, and whether Colpodella spp. are pathogenic to pangolins awaits further study. The findings suggest that more attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases in the rescue operation of pangolins and other wildlife.
