Neurocysticercosis is an important, but neglected disease in many low- and middle-income countries. In resource-poor areas, management of the disease is impeded by lack of availability of, and access to, adequate diagnostic techniques. Immunological tests, performed on serum or urine of affected humans, could be tools of interest in improving the diagnostic pathway. This systematic review provides an overview of immunological tests that have been evaluated so far, and especially focusses on test performance in detection of cysts with specific localization, stage and number. Results on test accuracy proved difficult to retrieve from published records. The comparison of obtained test results was exceedingly challenging due to large heterogeneity. With usable data meticulously selected, several known test formats, such as the LLGP-EITB and the antigen ELISA, showed expected performance results, and some novel test formats, such as the multi-antigen print immunoassay, were highly promising. Also, urine-based tests could provide a non-invasive alternative to serum-based tests. Evaluation of immunological tests in non-clinical settings requires a sufficient sample size for further analysis of data. To improve management of the disease in targeted resource-poor settings, immunological test formats will have to comply with high performance and ease-of-use standards, to optimize chances of future implementation.
