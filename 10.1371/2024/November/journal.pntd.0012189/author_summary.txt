Buruli ulcer (BU), a neglected tropical skin disease, is emerging as a public health concern in the temperate Australian state of Victoria. Here, BU is spread by mosquitoes, and native possums are wildlife reservoirs of the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium ulcerans. Possums can be infected by BU, but knowledge of infection and disease in these animals is limited. We conducted surveillance studies in the two largest cities of Victoria, examining live and deceased possums. We found skin lesions in a third of examined possums and confirmed presence of M. ulcerans in almost three-quarters of the animals. Mouth swabs were positive for the bacteria in nearly two thirds of possums, as were pouch swabs of almost half the females. We also conducted mapping of the bodily distribution of skin lesions and found that paws and the undersides of abdomens and tails were the most affected areas. Our findings add support to the concept that possums, particularly ringtails, are M. ulcerans reservoirs in Victoria, and suggest several possible routes of infection for free-living possums that warrant further research. Improved understanding of BU in possums may allow development of targeted interventions that reduce disease transmission and protect both animal and human health.
