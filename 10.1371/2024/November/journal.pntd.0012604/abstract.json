    "Background": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that is responsible for Chikungunya fever, which is characterized by fever, rash, and debilitating polyarthralgia. Since its re-emergence in 2004, CHIKV has continued to spread to new regions and become a severe health threat to global public. Development of safe and single dose vaccines that provide durable protection is desirable to control the spread of virus. The recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors represent promising vaccine platform to provide prolonged protection with a single-dose immunization. In this study, we developed a rAAV capsid serotype 1 vector based CHIKV vaccine and evaluated its protection effect against CHIKV challenge.",
    "Methodology": "The recombinant AAV1 encoding the full-length structural proteins of CHIKV (named as rAAV1-CHIKV-SP) was generated in vitro by transfecting the plasmids of AAV helper-free system into HEK-293T cells. The safety and immunogenicity of rAAV1-CHIKV-SP were tested in 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice. The antibody responses of the mice receiving prime-boost or single-dose immunization of the vaccine were determined by ELISA and plaque reduction neutralizing test. The immunized mice were challenged with CHIKV to evaluate the protection effect of the vaccine.",
    "Conclusions": "The rAAV1-CHIKV-SP showed remarkable safety and immunogenicity in C57BL/6 mice. A single dose intramuscular injection of rAAV1-CHIKV-SP elicited high level and long-lasting antibody responses, and conferred complete protection against a heterologous CHIKV strain challenge. These results suggest rAAV1-CHIKV-SP represents a promising vaccine candidate against different CHIKV clades with a simplified immunization strategy."
