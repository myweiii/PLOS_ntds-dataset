Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a fatal form of leishmaniasis caused by the digenetic parasite Leishmania donovani. In South Asia, around 10–20% of the cured VL cases develop a chronic dermal manifestation known as post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). Patients with PKDL serve as ‘active disease reservoirs’, perpetuating the transmission cycle and thereby pose a significant threat to the success of the ongoing kala-azar elimination program. Moreover, the absence of an animal model in PKDL poses a great challenge in elucidating the pathogenesis of the disease, thereby restricting studies exclusively to clinical cases. Neutrophils are recognized as crucial players in the initial phase of VL, acting as the ‘first line of defence’ and actively influence the outcome of infection, but their significance in PKDL has been overlooked, with previous research primarily focussing on macrophages and lymphocytes. This study addresses the critical gap in understanding the role of neutrophils in PKDL. This study revealed that neutrophils infiltrating at the lesional sites in PKDL played a functional role in modulating the disease pathology, shedding light on their involvement beyond the initial phase of infection. Conclusively, the findings in this study highlighted the importance of considering neutrophils as the ‘new kid in the block’ in PKDL immunology. In addition, this study contributed to a broader understanding of the disease pathogenesis by elucidating the extended roles of neutrophils in chronic phase of infection providing valuable insights that could potentiate targeted interventions, crucial for elimination of this debilitating neglected tropical disease.
