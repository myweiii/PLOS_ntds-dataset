Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni is the only intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum in hilly regions of south-west China, its distribution area directly determines the epidemic range of schistosomiasis. This study sequenced 26 complete mitochondrial genomes of Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni and analyzed their genetic differentiation. Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni is subdivided into Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni Yunnan strain and Sichuan strain. Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni Yunnan strain exhibits a higher level of genetic identity and clear north-south differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this work reported the first mitochondrial genome of Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni Yunnan strain, which could be used as an important reference genome for Oncomelania hupensis, and also provide the important information for explaining the distribution pattern of Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni and control of Schistosoma japonicum.
