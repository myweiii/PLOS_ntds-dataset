    "Objective": "Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni is the only intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum in hilly regions of south-west China, which plays a key role during the transmission of Schistosomiasis. This study aimed to sequence the complete mitochondrial genome of Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni and analyze genetic differentiation of Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni.",
    "Methods": "Samples were from 13 villages in Yunnan Province of China, with 30 Oncomelania hupensis snails per village, and the complete mitochondrial genome was sequenced. A comprehensive analysis of the genetic differentiation of Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni was conducted by constructing phylogenetic trees, calculating genetic distances, and analyzing identity.",
    "Results": "A total of 26 complete mitochondrial sequences were determined. The length of genome ranged from 15,181 to 15,187 bp, and the base composition of the genome was A+T (67.5%) and G+C content (32.5%). This genome encoded 37 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes. The phylogenetic trees and identity analysis confirmed that Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni was subdivided into Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni Yunnan strain and Sichuan strain, with a genetic distance of 0.0834. Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni Yunnan strain was further subdivided into two sub-branches, corresponding to \"Yunnan North\" and \"Yunnan South\", with a genetic distance of 0.0216, and the samples exhibited over 97% identity.",
    "Conclusion": "Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni is subdivided into Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni Yunnan strain and Sichuan strain. Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni Yunnan strain exhibits a higher level of genetic identity and clear north-south differentiation. This work reported the first mitochondrial genome of Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni Yunnan strain, which could be used as an important reference genome for Oncomelania hupensis, and also provide the important information for explaining the distribution pattern of Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni and control of Schistosoma japonicum."
