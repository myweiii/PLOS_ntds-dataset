    "Introduction": "Salmonella enterica is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that consists of more than 2,600 serovars [1,2]. Some of these serovars are host-restricted like typhoidal serovars, and the majority of the serovars are host-unrestricted (non-typhoidal) [3]. The non-typhoidal serovars have wider host ranges, are more common, easily transmissible, hard to control, and contribute to a significant proportion of Salmonellosis in humans and animals worldwide [4,5]. It has been estimated that non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) causes about 93.8 million illnesses and 230 thousand fatalities in humans per year globally [6]. In 2017, the invasive form of NTS caused about 535,000 illnesses and 77,500 deaths, being highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and vulnerable groups of the population (children, elderly people, and people with HIV infection) [7,8].\nThe syndromes due to the infections of NTS may range from mild gastroenteritis to severe, life-threatening systemic illnesses. The severity or burden of the infection in patients is highly related to the presence of virulence factors in the pathogen [9,10] and the serovar involved [9,11]. Virulence agents (encoding genes) such as invasion A (invA) and plasmid virulence (spvC) are important factors in the invasion of host epithelial cells and systemic illnesses, respectively [12,13]. The serovars of NTS can be identified using antigenic variations in the O (lipopolysaccharide), H (flagella), and Vi (capsular) antigens by the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme [14,15]. Determining the NTS serovars is very important to understand the clinical manifestations, environmental adaptability, antimicrobial susceptibility, and other characteristics of the pathogen [16].\nThe emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among NTS serovars is becoming a public health concern in the world. The development of AMR is highly related to the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials, which creates a selective pressure so that the susceptible group diminishes and resistant ones flourish [2,17].\nThe majority of NTS infections in humans are associated with the consumption of contaminated food, unprotected contact with infected animals, and a contaminated environment. Cattle are an important reservoir of NTS that plays a role in the contamination of foods from animal sources like meat and milk and the environment [18]. The frequent interaction of humans, animals, and the environment in the human-dairy interface may be attributed to NTS outbreaks in the community [18,19].\nThe NTS is a significant problem in developing countries like Ethiopia due to unhygienic practices, lack of infrastructure needed for proper implementation of food safety measures and laws, weak regulatory systems, a habit of consuming raw or inadequately cooked food items, and frequent and unprotected contact with animals and the environment [20\u201322]. It is one of the top ten disease-causing agents ranked based on the impact on the intensification of animal production [23]. Assessing the occurrence of NTS and characterization will help to devise evidence-based control and prevention measures that can reduce the risks of infection. The prevalence of NTS in Ethiopia has been reported in both humans and animals [20,24,25]. However, in the Northwest part of Ethiopia, such information is limited or not well documented. Furthermore, the prevalence of NTS serovars and the presence of common virulence factors haven\u2019t been well characterized in the area. Therefore, this study was conducted to detect NTS and determine the circulating serovars, common virulence genes, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates in the human-dairy interface in Northwest Ethiopia by following a one-health approach.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethical approval\nEthical approval was obtained from the University of Gondar\u2019s ethical review board with reference number VP/RTT/05/60/2021 for its ethical soundness and acceptability. The letters of introduction and cooperation were written from the University of Gondar to the selected districts. At the farm level, the farm owners and study participants in dairy farms were informed about the purpose and procedures of the study. Verbal informed consent was obtained from each human participant in the selected dairy farms.\n\n\nStudy area\nThe study was conducted in the northwest part of Ethiopia. In the area, two cities (Bahir Dar and Gondar), and seven districts (Dangila, Fogera, Kemkem, Takusa, Bahir Dar Zuria, Gondar Zuria, and Debark) were selected based on their relatively higher dairy production activities (Fig 1). These areas have elevations ranging from 1820 to 2706 meters above sea level and are located between 10\u00b0 30\u2019 0\" North (N) and 12\u00b0 0\u2019 0\" N latitude, and between 36\u00b0 43\u2019 12\" East (E) and 38\u00b0 4\u2019 48\" E longitude. The average annual temperature and rainfall range from 10 to 30\u00b0C and 1,000 to 1,500 mm, respectively [26]. The area consists of small to medium-sized dairy farms. Dairy farmers in this area supply milk and milk products to urban centers in the Amhara regional state or beyond, where dairy product consumption is high [27].\nThe shape files were downloaded from https://diva-gis.org/data.html.\n\n\nStudy design and study population\nThe study was cross-sectional and conducted from June 2022 to August 2023 by targeting raw milk, dairy cows, milk containers, contact persons (milkers), and the environment among dairy farms in selected sites. All humans and animals sampled were apparently healthy and were not taking antimicrobials at the time of sampling. All animals were lactating cows. Based on the number of animals within the farm, the dairy farms were classified as small (20 or fewer animals), medium, or above (21 or more animals) dairy farms [18]. Cow\u2019s body condition was categorized as poor, medium, and good based on the assessment of its condition at different directions and visibility of bones as described by Mishra et al. [28].\n\n\nSample size estimation and sampling\nThe sample size was estimated by considering a 5% margin of error, at a 95% confidence interval and the 19.4% maximum reported prevalence of NTS in Ethiopia [29,30]. Accordingly, the minimum calculated sample size was 241. However, a total of 362 samples were collected to increase the representativeness due to multiple sample types in a selected farm [31,32] and the interest in isolating other bacteria from the samples. In the selected sampling sites, the dairy farms were randomly selected from the list of dairy farms in each district\u2019s livestock development offices and included in the study. The number of dairy farms enrolled in each study site was determined proportionally based on the total number of dairy farms in each site [33]. From each selected dairy farm, at least six types of samples (pooled raw milk, stool from milkers, dairy farm sewage, feces from lactating cows, swabs from milk containers, and milkers\u2019 hands) were collected. If the number of dairy cows on the farm was greater than 10, two fecal samples from lactating cows were collected.\n\n\nSample collection and transportation\nInformation related to the milkers\u2019 socio-demographic characteristics, farm size, milkers and milk containers as well as feed and water source of dairy cows were collected by using a personal observation, checklist and interviewing the milkers. Samples were collected by using sterile containers. Approximately 50 ml of pooled raw milk were collected aseptically. Swabs from milkers\u2019 hands and milk containers were collected separately by using sterile cotton swabs and placed into test tubes containing sterile buffered peptone water (BPW) (Granucult, Germany). About 10 ml of effluent samples were collected and placed into sterile containers. Similarly, about 10 grams of stool samples were collected in sterile stool cups with applicator sticks from milkers. Finally, approximately 10 grams of fecal samples were collected directly from the rectum of randomly selected lactating dairy cows using sterile disposable gloves and added into the sterile screw-capped tube. Samples were transported using an icebox to the food safety laboratory of the University of Gondar, Ethiopia. On arrival, samples were processed immediately or put in a refrigerator (~4\u00b0C) and processed within 24 hours of collection.\n\n\nBacteriological analysis\nThe isolation of NTS was performed using the techniques recommended by the International Organization for Standardization [34]. Each sample type was first enriched non-selectively in BPW at a 1:10 ratio. Swab samples transported in 9 ml of BPW were incubated directly. Three grams of animal feces, human stool, and sewage samples were separately transferred into a sterile container with 27 ml of sterile BPW. Twenty-five ml of the milk sample was transferred into a sterile screw-capped glass bottle containing sterile 225 ml BPW. The sample with enrichment fluid was mixed thoroughly and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours (S3 Fig).\nThe Rappaport-Vassiliadis soya (RVS) broth (Oxoid, England) and Muller-Kauffmann Tetrathionate-Novobiocin (MKTTn) broth (Oxoid, UK) were used for selective enrichment. From the enriched fluid, 0.1 ml was transferred into a tube containing 10 ml of RVS broth and incubated at 41.5\u00b0C for 24 hours. Another 1 ml of the enriched sample was transferred into a tube containing 10 ml of MKTTn broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. Then, a loop full of enriched sample was plated on xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD) agar (Hi-Media, India) and Hektoen enteric (HE) agar (Thermofisher, Netherlands). After incubation, the plates were examined for the presence of typical colonies (pink colonies with or without black centers on XLD agar and blue-green to blue colonies with or without black centers on HE agar) [34] (S1 Fig). From both selective plating mediums, three to five suspected colonies were taken and streaked separately over the surface of tryptone soya agar (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and then incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C for biochemical characterization. Colonies on tryptone soya agar were subjected to preliminary biochemical screening using urease, triple sugar iron agar, lysine decarboxylase, and indole tests. All presumptive NTS isolates that fulfilled the preliminary biochemical tests were further characterized by the analytical profile index (API) 20E test (BioMerieux Inc. France). All NTS isolates that passed the API 20E test were confirmed by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization\u2013Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) (S3 Fig).\n\n\nSerovar identification\nThe serovar identification of NTS isolates was conducted by slide agglutination test using a Salmonella serotyping kit (SSI, Austria) according to the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme [15,35]. The laboratory procedure was performed at the National Reference Laboratory for Salmonella, Graz, Austria.\n\n\nDetection of common virulence genes\nThe DNA of the bacterial isolates was extracted using the heat lysis method [36]. Briefly, 250 \u03bcl of the overnight incubated broth was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 3 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets were washed with 1000 \u03bcl sterile physiological saline (0.85%). Subsequently, 100 \u03bcl of nuclease-free water was added to the pellets, and the mixture was mixed by vortex mixer, boiled at 100\u00b0C for 10 minutes, then chilled on ice for about 5 minutes. Finally, the cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was taken and stored at -20\u00b0C until use as the DNA template.\nAmplification of the gene invA was carried out in a total volume of 20 \u03bcl containing 10 \u03bcl of the Master mix (2x GoTaq colorless Master mix, Promega USA), 0.62 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM forward primer, 0.65 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM reverse primer, 6.73 \u03bcl nuclease-free water and 2 \u03bcl DNA template [37]. The reaction mixture for amplification of spvC gene was prepared similarly, except using 0.8 \u03bcl forward and 0.8 \u03bcl reverse primer and 6.4 \u03bcl nuclease-free water [38]. The PCR thermal cycling conditions, primers, and amplicon lengths for the target genes are listed in Table 1. The initial denaturation, total cycle, and final extension in all reactions were 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, 30, and 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes, respectively [38,39].\n\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility test\nFor the antimicrobial susceptibility test, the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used. Each bacterial isolate was tested for a set of 13 antimicrobials, which are grouped into 8 classes. Each isolated NTS was inoculated on an agar plate and allowed to grow overnight at 37\u00b0C. Colonies of the isolates were emulsified in physiological saline (0.85% NaCl) solution to the concentration equivalent to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standards. The bacterial suspensions were inoculated on Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid, England) by using a sterile cotton swab. A paper disk impregnated with a fixed concentration of antimicrobial agent was applied and incubated for 24 hours. After incubation, the diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured using a caliper and classified as \u201csensitive,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d and \u201cresistant\u201d based on the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute [40] guideline (S1 Table).\n\n\nQuality assurance\nAll media were prepared based on the manufacturers\u2019 recommendation, and the sterility of each batch was checked before inoculation and testing. Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 13311 was used as a positive control during biochemical and molecular tests.\n\n\nData management and analysis\nThe data were recorded and coded using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and summarized using descriptive statistics. The bivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of NTS isolates across different variables using SPSS software version 20. The association with a p-value of \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The percentage of serovars, virulence genes, and AMR were calculated from the total confirmed NTS isolates.",
    "Results": "Demography and characteristics of sample sources\nA total of 362 samples were collected and analyzed. As indicated in Table 2, most of the milkers were male (75.9%), aged from 31 to 50 years (53.4%), and had primary or basic educational levels (29.3%). Most of the farms were small-sized (82.8%), with zero grazing (87.9%), used tap water as the primary water source (77.6%), and used plastic non-food grade containers (58.6%) for milking and storage. Most of the sampled cows were aged between 6\u201310 years (63.1%) and medium in body condition (56.0%). Milking was conducted by hand in all farms.\n\n\nDetection of Non-typhoidal Salmonella\nThe overall proportion of NTS was 7.7% with a 95% confidence interval of 5.4\u201311.0%. The highest proportion of NTS was observed in cows\u2019 feces (11.9%), whereas the lowest was in the milker\u2019s hand swab samples (1.7%) (Table 3). Table 3 also depicts the proportion of NTS detected in different sampling sites. The highest proportion was on dairy farms found in Takusa (14.3%), and the lowest was among samples collected in the Dangila district (4.5%). These areas were clustered based on their geographic proximity and potential contacts, and compared. However, a difference was not observed between the two clusters.\nAmong the human samples (n = 58) (stool and/or hand swabs), 3 (5.2%) NTS isolates were detected, and all were isolated from males, and ages ranged from 18 to 30 years. Among the 58 dairy farms, 23 (39.7%) had at least one positive sample. The detection proportions were not statistically significant among herd size, feed sources, primary water sources, and commonly used milking container types of farms. Among the samples collected from lactating cows (feces) (n = 84), 10 (11.9%) were positive for NTS. The data showed that there was no statistically significant association between the occurrence of NTS with both age and body condition categories of the cows (Table 2).\n\n\nSerovars of non-typhoidal Salmonella isolates\nSix serovars were detected, which belonged to two subspecies (S. enterica subspecies enterica (75.0%) and S. enterica subspecies diarizonae (25.0%). The dominant serovars were S. Uganda (39.3%), S. enterica subsp. diarizonae (25.0%), and S. Typhimurium (21.4%). The isolates have 8 antigen formulas (Table 4). Table 4 also shows the serovars in different sample types. The dominant serovar (S. Uganda) was isolated from pooled raw milk, milk containers, sewage, and cow\u2019s fecal samples.\n\n\nVirulence genes\nIn the current study, PCR amplification confirmed the presence of the two targeted virulence genes (invA and spvC) in different proportions. All 28 isolates contained the invA gene, whereas 21.4% of them were positive for the spvC gene. The invA was found in all types of samples, whereas the spvC gene was detected from milk, animal feces, and human stool samples. The gel pictures (PCR products) of invA and spvC genes are illustrated in Fig 2A and 2B, respectively. Table 5 shows the availability of virulence genes in each serovar. The invA gene was detected in all serovars whereas spvC was detected in S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis.\nRepresentative two separate gel electrophoresis pictures of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products (A. Gene invA fragments at 389 base pair (bp); Lanes 1\u20139, invA amplified from non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) isolates; B Gene spvC fragments at 571 bp, lanes 3,4,5,6,7, and 8 were amplified from NTS isolates. In all cases, lane L 100 bp molecular marker (ladder), lane PC or lane 10, positive control; Lane NC, negative control (S2 Fig).\n\n\nAntimicrobial resistance profile\nNon-typhoidal Salmonella isolates (n = 28) were tested against 13 commonly used antimicrobials representing 8 classes. The result showed that a higher proportion of resistance was observed in ampicillin (57.1%), tetracycline (42.9%), and chloramphenicol (35.7%). On the other hand, NTS isolates were more susceptible to ceftriaxone (100%), azithromycin (96.4%), and norfloxacin (96.4%) (Fig 3). Among the NTS isolates tested, 89.3% were resistant to one or more classes, and 46.4% were resistant to more than two classes of antimicrobial agents (multi-drug resistance (MDR)) [41, 42]. The result also showed that MDR isolates were isolated from animals, humans, milk, and the environment (Table 6). Table 6 also shows the resistance pattern of NTS isolates.\nAMP, ampicillin; AMC, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; CRO, ceftriaxone; CTX, cefotaxime; CAZ, ceftazidime; C, chloramphenicol; TE, tetracycline; DO, doxycycline; AT, azithromycin; NA, nalidixic acid; NOR, norfloxacin; CIP, ciprofloxacin; SXT, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Isolates were divided into susceptible, intermediate, or resistant based on CLSI guidelines [40] (S1 Data).",
    "Discussion": "Detection of Non-typhoidal Salmonella in the feces of animals, milk, milk containers, and farm environments can be potential sources for human infections and subsequent spreading to the public at large [43]. Without a thorough understanding of the potential reservoirs, it is practically impossible to design effective control and prevention strategies. In this study, we demonstrated that the main components of the human-dairy interface (human, animal, milk, and environment like sewage) are the reservoir and potential source of NTS infection.\nThe factors that make NTS survive and shed in apparently healthy humans and animals are not well exploited. However, pathogen-related factors like adherence and secretory effectors, other virulence factors, and host-related factors like immune response may play a role in the survival and shedding of the pathogen [44]. As it has been indicated in the results of this study, apparently healthy individuals can be the asymptomatic carriers of NTS and play a role in the fecal-oral transmission and contamination of food, especially by food handlers for future outbreaks. For control and prevention of NTS, these individuals can be a threat and require special attention [44]. The presence of NTS in the feces of apparently healthy animals is also an indication that feces of an animal can be the source of milk or environmental contamination which keeps the public at risk of NTS infection [45].\nBacteria like NTS enter into the milk mainly during and/or after milking from uncleaned teat or udder of the animal, the milker, the milking environment (dust), the water used to clean the milk containers, flies or other insects, the addition of contaminated water, or other adulteration practices [46]. The proportion of NTS in pooled raw milk was 10.3% in the current study. In line with this, a previous study showed that the prevalence of NTS in raw milk in Ethiopia was 10.8% [47]. However, as high as 19.4% prevalence of NTS in raw milk was also reported by Bedassa et al. [30]. The difference may be related to the factors that promote the survival and spread of the pathogen and the chance of contamination of the raw milk [30,43].\nThe NTS can be found not only in animals and food like milk but also in the environment (sewage). The results of this study showed that sewage can serve as a reservoir of NTS. The presence of the isolates in the sewage also showed their ability to survive in different environments. The pathogen in the sewage can contaminate water bodies like rivers, underground water, or vegetables if released without appropriate treatment [48]. People can acquire the bacteria by direct contact with the sewage with inadequate hand washing, drinking contaminated water, or eating contaminated vegetables [49].\nAssessing and determining the risk factors of NTS is very essential for the control and prevention of the disease. In this study, even though different risk factors were considered, strong evidence regarding the influence of factors was not obtained. Hence, large-scale and longitudinal studies are necessary to understand the factors that may contribute to the presence of the pathogen in the human-dairy interface [50]. We detected NTS in all sampling sites. The presence of the pathogen in different regions of Ethiopia was also previously reported [30]. This may be related to the hygienic status of farms, the health of animals, and husbandry practices. These all showed that intervention measures should be conducted in the study areas and beyond.\nIdentifying the serovars of Salmonella is a very important practice since the severity of the disease, the geographic area, the animal affected, environmental adaptability, and antimicrobial resistance pattern may vary among serovars [16,35]. The findings of this study showed that different serovars of NTS were circulating in the human-dairy interface, which necessitates the designing of control and prevention strategies. These serovars have been reported not only in the community and dairy farms but also in healthcare facilities and clinical cases since they were reported by Kebede et al. [51] and Amare et al. [52].\nThe pathogenicity of NTS is mainly related to the presence of virulence factors [53\u201355]. The virulence factors may be found on mobile genetic elements (plasmids, transposons) and specific sections of the bacterial chromosome, like pathogenicity islands [56,57]. In this study, the presence of the two common virulence genes (invA and spvC) encoding different virulent factors was investigated. The invA gene helps the bacterium to invade and penetrate the host cells. In this study, the invA gene was detected in all isolates, and this is supported by a previous report that showed a 100% detection of the invA gene among NTS isolates in Malaysia [12], Iran [58], and Egypt [19]. Detection of the invA gene among NTS isolates was recommended for the diagnosis of the pathogen since it occurs in all strains [59]. The spvC gene enables the pathogen to survive within the macrophages and facilitate systemic infections [60]. In this study, 21.4% of the isolates were positive for the spvC gene. Previously, 30.6% spvC gene prevalence among NTS isolates was reported in Egypt [19] and 37% prevalence was also reported in Iran [58].\nThe emergence and spread of AMR in pathogens like NTS is an important challenge in the world, particularly in low-income countries where the prevalence of bacterial pathogens in general and NTS, in particular, is high. In this study, 46.4% were MDR. The MDR strains are usually associated with higher morbidity (frequent bloodstream infections and hospitalizations) and mortality than susceptible strains [61,62]. In Ethiopia, the problem is frequently reported [63]; the study conducted by Beyene et al. [64] and Tweldemedhin et al. [65] reported that the prevalence of MDR among Salmonella enterica isolates was 59.46% and 65%, respectively. Nowadays, due to the emergence of resistance strains, the treatment regimen for Salmonella infection is shifted to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins [52]. However, increasing the burden of AMR, resistant strains to these preferred antimicrobials have also been emerging.\nIn this study, resistant strains were detected in humans, animals, food (milk), and the environment (sewage), which provided further evidence that AMR is not only an issue of human and animal health sectors but also the environment. Park et al. [66] and Beyene et al. [67] reported that environmental waste (slurry) from dairy was one source of AMR and a critical point for the mitigation of AMR.\n\nLimitations\nIn this study, dairy farms were visited once, and numerators (positives) were small, which didn\u2019t allow us to generate strong evidence to see the influence of factors like seasons, farm practices, and others. Hence, long-term study and repeated sampling were preferable for a better understanding of the influence of factors.",
    "Conclusions": "The study provided valuable information regarding NTS in the human-dairy interface. The bacterium was detected in considerable proportion in Northwest Ethiopia and all types of samples (cow\u2019s feces, pooled raw milk, milk container, human stool, hand swabs, and dairy farm sewage) and sampling sites. The farm level detection was high, which demonstrates NTS is circulating in the human-dairy interface. Six serovars that belong to two subspecies were detected. The two common virulence genes (invA and spvC) were detected with different proportions. The NTS isolates were more resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. However, the isolates were more susceptible to ceftriaxone, norfloxacin, and azithromycin. Intervention measures like hygiene, treating raw milk by appropriate pasteurization or boiling before consumption, and prudent use of antimicrobials have to be enhanced in dairy farms."
