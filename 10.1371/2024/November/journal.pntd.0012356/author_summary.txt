Chagas disease (CD), or American trypanosomiasis, is considered by the WHO as one of the most important neglected diseases of the American continent, considered as strictly American, there are currently cases of the disease spread all over the world as a consequence of human movements even in areas where the biological cycle of the protozoan parasite responsible for the disease does not occur.
Laboratory diagnostic methods vary between direct tests that denote active parasitemia in blood in the acute phase of the disease and indirect molecular methods applied when the circulating parasitemia disappears in the chronic phase of the disease.
Despite the existence of numerous diagnostic, molecular or immunological tests, the latter being generally easier to perform in diagnostic laboratories, the presence of the parasite always remains in doubt in various situations. Particularly in those patients after treatment since the presence of antibodies to the parasite remain at high titres for years, or in the case of newborn diagnosis in which the motherâ€™s IgG makes specific immunological tests impossible for months.
Therefore, given the need to find biomarkers in chronically ill patients or in mothers and newborns that indicate the active presence of parasites, we have used the purification of parasite extracellular vesicles (EVs) in circulating blood or the immunocomplexes they form with host IgGs, by means of two techniques, the gold standard technique by ultracentrifugation and an adapted technique, easier to apply in diagnostic laboratories, to purify these EVs in order to study the recognition of these EVs by antibodies against the parasite or against specific antigens of Trypanosoma cruzi specific antigens.
We believe that this technique can be used when it is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of treatments or in neonatal diagnosis.
