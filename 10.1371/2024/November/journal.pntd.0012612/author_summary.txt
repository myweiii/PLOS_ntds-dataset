Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, can lead to serious heart complications, known as Chagas cardiomyopathy. This study investigates the role of oxidative stress on the growth of T. cruzi and the effects of antioxidants, particularly protoporphyrin cobalt (CoPP), on heart health using two distinct strains of the parasite (Y and Colombian strains). We found that CoPP and other antioxidants, including apocynin, resveratrol, and tempol, reduced parasite levels in heart cells, while oxidative stress increased it. In mice infected with the Y strain of T. cruzi, CoPP treatment during the acute phase improved heart function, reduced parasite burden, and increased survival, outperforming the standard treatment with benznidazole.
However, CoPPâ€™s benefits were mostly confined to the early stages of infection. When treatment was administered during the chronic phase, it did not improve heart function or reduce parasite levels in mice infected with the Colombian strain, despite previous studies showing that other antioxidants can be beneficial in this stage. These findings suggest that the type of antioxidant and the timing of treatment are crucial in managing Chagas disease.
This work underscores the potential of early antioxidant treatments like CoPP to protect heart function and prevent long-term damage, potentially offering better treatment strategies.
