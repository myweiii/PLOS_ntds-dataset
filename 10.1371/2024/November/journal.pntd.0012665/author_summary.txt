In this study we explored how starvation and temperature affect the relationship between the insect Rhodnius prolixus and the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease. R. prolixus is a key vector for this disease in South America. We examined the impact of repeated 30-day fasting periods on the life cycle of the insect and the population of the parasite at temperatures ranging from 24째C to 30째C.
Higher temperatures negatively affected the survival of these insects under conditions of starvation. The insects lost more weight and had lower survival rates at higher temperatures. We also discovered that at 24째C and 30째C, fewer insects developed a chronic T. cruzi infection. Additionally, starvation led to a gradual reduction of the parasite population size in the insects over developmental stages. In this context, we found no effect of infection on R. prolixus.
Our findings highlight the crucial role of the vector nutritional status in the development and survival of both the insect and the parasite. This research deepens our understanding of how temperature and the nutrition status of the vector together influence the spread of Chagas disease, providing valuable insights for predicting the epidemiology of the disease in a changing climate.
