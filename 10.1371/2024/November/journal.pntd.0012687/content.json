    "Introduction": "Infections with soil-transmitted helminths (STH), namely Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm species (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus) still pose a significant health challenge globally [1]. Presently, nearly 1.5 billion individuals worldwide, predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions, suffer from these parasitic infections [2]. This results in an annual burden of approximately 1.9 million disability-adjusted life years [3]. The consequences of STH infections encompass nutritional deficiencies, anaemia, impaired physical and cognitive development in children, and diminished work performance in adulthood [4,5]. Current control strategies predominantly rely on preventive chemotherapy, involving the routine administration of mebendazole or albendazole to populations at risk. Nevertheless, the currently employed drugs have been shown to have low efficacy against infections with T. trichiura [6,7].\nIn 2017, WHO added the combination of albendazole and ivermectin to their List of Essential Medicines, as it had been shown in several clinical trials and a systematic review to be more efficacious than albendazole alone against STH [7,8]. This shift from a single tablet of albendazole to the combination involves extra costs as ivermectin is not donated. However, since recent years ivermectin is available from generic producers at an affordable cost. Moreover, ivermectin is a weight dependent drug and, therefore, this combination therapy requires individually assessing the number of ivermectin tablets to administer. In the context of mass drug administration where millions of people are treated yearly, this may require a considerable amount of extra resources and time.\nThe \u201cFeasibility And Cost-Effectiveness of Improved Treatment against helminthiases in children\u201d (FACE IT) project aims at exploring the most feasible and effective approach to the mass administration of the ivermectin-albendazole combination for STH. Prior to the wide implementation of the combination of albendazole and ivermectin, the first step of this project involved implementing a clinical trial to confirm, for the first time, that in Uganda the combination is indeed more efficacious than albendazole alone. The context for this is that a recent multi-country trial found that whereas in Pemba Island (Tanzania) and Lao PDR the combination was significantly more efficacious than albendazole alone, this was not the case in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire where both drugs were equally and insufficiently efficacious. One of the reasons behind this might be the existence of a Trichuris species phylogenetically distinct from T. trichiura (T. incognita) that is less responsive to ivermectin-albendazole [9].\nIn the current study, we aimed at confirming superiority of the combination of albendazole and ivermectin against T. trichiura infections compared to albendazole alone in Uganda.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nEthical approval was obtained from the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST, no. HS3160ES), the Vector Control Division Research and Ethics Review Committee (VCDREC, no. VCDR-2023-29) and from the Ethics Committee of North-western and Central Switzerland (EKNZ, no. AO_2023\u201300066). Written consent was obtained from caregivers of all children participating in this study.\n\n\nTrial design\nThis parallel open-label randomized controlled superiority trial took place in the primary schools of Kahungye, Kabale district, and Rwanzu, Kisoro district, both in south-western Uganda. Participants were allocated 1:1 to receive either a single dose of albendazole alone or albendazole plus ivermectin.\n\n\nRandomization and masking\nRandomization was performed through a computer-generated sequence with varying block sizes of four and six, stratified into two levels by baseline T. trichiura-infection intensities (light: 1\u2013999 eggs per gram (EPG), and moderate plus heavy: \u2265 1000 EPG). Treatment allocation was concealed using sealed opaque envelopes, each labelled with a treatment identification code. The person delivering the drugs was not blinded, but outcome-assessing laboratory personnel were.\n\n\nInterventions\nEligible schoolchildren were administered a single dose of either albendazole alone or in combination with ivermectin. The number of ivermectin tablets was based on the standard dose pole category each child fell into: one tablet if the child was between 90\u2013119 cm of height; two if between 120\u2013140 cm; three if between 141\u2013158 cm; four if above 158 cm. The dose pole was used as a proxy for weight-based dosing and corresponded to the WHO recommended tools to administer 200 \u03bcg/kg of ivermectin if 3 mg tablets are used [10].\n\n\nProcedures\nParticipants\u2019 name, age, sex, and school grade were recorded. Caregivers of children falling within the 6 to 12 years age group attending the study schools were invited to information sessions. During these sessions, a study representative explained the study\u2019s objectives, procedures, benefits, and potential associated risks. Caregivers were given the opportunity to ask questions, and those opting for their child\u2019s participation were asked to provide written informed consent. Caregivers who were unable to read provided a thumbprint, and an impartial witness signed, confirming that the team delivered a comprehensive explanation of all relevant information contained in the informed consent form.\nChildren with caregiver consent were asked to provide two baseline stool samples to assess infection with T. trichiura. All children who had at least two of the four Kato-Katz slides positive for T. trichiura were invited for treatment. Prior to treatment, all invited children who were present underwent clinical and physical examinations.\nConsented children received an empty container marked with their unique identification number (ID) for collection of the first stool sample. The subsequent day, they received a second empty container for the second stool sample. The majority of samples were self-collected by participants at schools and were, therefore, fresh. Whenever feasible, the two stool samples were collected on consecutive days. The field laboratory was set up at the study schools themselves, where experienced technicians produced duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears from each sample. Under a light microscope, eggs of T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides were counted and hookworm egg presence documented separately within one hour after preparing the Kato-Katz slides to prevent the clearing of hookworm eggs. Quality control for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura was implemented by randomly selecting 10% of the Kato-Katz slides, eliminating their original ID, and relabelling them with a new quality control ID prior to having technicians re-read the selected slides. For hookworm quality control, a portion of each sample was transferred to a new container, and labelled with a new quality control ID to prevent technicians from identifying the sample; technicians were asked to prepare one Kato-Katz slide from each of these containers and read it.\nChildren who were infected with T. trichiura in at least two out of four Kato-Katz slides were invited for physical and clinical examinations prior to treatment. Exclusion criteria comprised presence or signs of major systemic illnesses, anthelmintic drug intake within the past four weeks, participation in another experimental research study, and/or known allergy to either albendazole or ivermectin. Weight, height, and dose pole categories based on height were recorded in individual case report forms. Additionally, the children\u2019s temperature was also measured and documented; children who had a fever (\u2265 38\u00b0C) underwent a malaria rapid diagnostic test. A positive result would lead to exclusion from the randomization and treatment. Finally, a physician assessed their health to ensure eligibility.\nEnrolment and drug administration were overseen by the study team. Children were assigned to receive either albendazole alone (400 mg tablet) or the combination of albendazole (400 mg) and ivermectin (200 \u03bcg/kg approximated by dose pole height category). In Kahungye primary school, all children had received food prior to treatment, whereas in the Rwanzu primary school they received food one hour post-treatment. Physicians and nurses actively queried each participant for adverse events using a questionnaire at three and 24 hours post-treatment.\nDuring follow-up, conducted between 14 and 21 days after treatment, each participant was requested to provide two additional stool samples. Follow-up samples were also collected at school, if possible on two consecutive days, and underwent the same procedures as described for baseline samples. Participants still found infected with any STH at follow-up were treated with the combination of albendazole (400 mg) and ivermectin (200 \u03bcg/kg).\n\n\nEndpoints\nThe primary endpoint of this trial was T. trichiura infection status of participants 14\u201321 days post-treatment assessed by duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears. Secondary endpoints were T. trichiura intensity of infection (egg reduction rate (ERR)) 14\u201321 days post-treatment also assessed by duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears, and tolerability of treatment (adverse events (AEs) and treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)) at three and 24 hours post-treatment.\n\n\nSample size\nBased on data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Tanzania [11], we predicted a true CR of 8% for albendazole monotherapy and 30% for the combination of albendazole and ivermectin against T. trichiura in children aged 6\u201312 years. Hence, enrolling 64 participants per arm was estimated to be sufficient to identify a statistically significant difference with 90% power using a two-sided 5% significance level. To account for a loss to follow-up of 15%, we planned to recruit 75 schoolchildren per treatment arm, resulting in a total of 150 participants.\n\n\nStatistical methods\nThe primary analysis of trial data was performed according to the intention-to-treat principles, using the available case population, which included all participants with any primary endpoint data (i.e., at least one stool sample result at follow-up). Following this, a per-protocol analysis was conducted. Cure rates were computed as the percentage of participants positive for eggs at baseline who transitioned to egg-negative status post-treatment. Differences among CRs were assessed using a melded binomial test with mid-p correction, and the analysis was supplemented by adjusted logistic regressions using the stratification variable as additional predictor.\nEgg counts per gram were determined by calculating the mean egg counts from quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and multiplying the result by a factor of 24. Egg reduction rates, based on the geometric mean (GM) and arithmetic mean (AM) egg counts for each treatment arm before and after treatment, were calculated using the following formulas (Eqs 1 and 2):\nEq 1. Geometric mean egg reduction rate.\n\nEq 2. Arithmetic mean egg reduction rate.\n\nThe Bootstrap resampling method with 5,000 replicates was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for geometric ERRs and the difference between the ERRs.\nSafety outcomes were not assessed through statistical testing and adverse events are presented in frequency tables. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.0.3 and Stata 18. Specific symptoms observed post-treatment were considered TEAEs if they were not already present before treatment or if they worsened compared to pre-treatment severity.",
    "Results": "Trial participation\nConducted from October 9, 2023, to November 14, 2023, this open-label clinical trial involved the screening of 435 children for T. trichiura infections in two primary schools, Rwanzu and Kahungye, situated in the southwestern regions of Uganda. Among the screened participants, 402 provided two stool samples, and of these, 189 tested positive for T. trichiura. A total of 91% (173/189) met the minimum parasitological eligibility criteria (at least two out of four Kato-Katz slides positive). Eleven children were absent on treatment day, and one was excluded because he/she had a fever and tested positive for malaria. Consequently, 161 children were successfully randomized, including one child erroneously included who had two slides positive but had only provided one stool sample (Fig 1). Of the trial cohort children 33 belonged to Kahungye and 128 to Rwanzu primary school. Among all participants, 81 were included in the albendazole alone treatment arm and 80 in the combination treatment arm. No child was lost to follow-up, meaning all randomized children provided follow-up stool samples, although 9 children provided only one follow-up sample.\n*Including one participant with <4 Kato-Katz slides analysed, but 2 slides positive for TT that was erroneously randomized.\nOf the 435 children who were screened, 46.0% were infected with T. trichiura, 67.4% with A. lumbricoides and 3.7% with hookworm (S1 Table). For T. trichiura, 90% of infections were light and 10% were moderate. In the case of A. lumbricoides, more than half of infections were either moderate (52.6%) or heavy (2.4%).\n\n\nBaseline characteristics of trial cohort\nBaseline characteristics demonstrated comparability between participants in both treatment arms regarding age, sex, weight, height, and T. trichiura baseline infection intensity (Table 1). In both treatment arms about three quarters of the children (76.5% and 73.8% in the albendazole alone and albendazole plus ivermectin arm, respectively) were co-infected with A. lumbricoides, whereof more than half of the infections were of moderate intensity and in the ivermectin-albendazole arm four (6.8%) children had heavy intensity infections. Hookworm infections were rare with two and one individuals infected in the albendazole and the ivermectin-albendazole arm, respectively.\n\n\nEfficacy against Trichuris trichiura and co-infecting STH species\nThe mean ivermectin dose and standard deviation among the 80 children in the combination therapy arm corresponded to 223 \u00b1 51 \u03bcg/kg if weight was taken into account. A significant difference in the CRs for T. trichiura infection was observed between the group treated with albendazole alone (12.3%) and the combination of albendazole plus ivermectin (31.3%; difference 18.9%-points, 95% CI 6.2\u201331.2, p = 0.004; Table 2). Similarly, a statistical difference was observed between both groups with regard to ERR, with 52.7% in the albendazole-alone arm and a notably higher rate of 91.4% in the combination arm (difference 38.7%-points, 95% CI 23.5\u201357.8). Adjusting for baseline infection intensity did not alter the point or interval estimate significantly. For co-infections, we observed a higher CR for A. lumbricoides in the combination arm, in which all 59 baseline infected individuals were cured (100%), compared with 52 out of 62 (83.9%) in the albendazole monotherapy arm. No hookworm infections were observed at follow-up.\nData are n (%) and mean (SD). CR, cure rate; CI, confidence interval; EPG, eggs per gram of stool; ERR, egg reduction rate.\n\n\nTolerability of the treatment regimens\nAll 161 trial participants were assessed for baseline symptoms and were reassessed for any adverse events (AEs) and treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs; symptoms not already observed in the participant prior drug administration) three hours post-treatment (Table 3). In total, 159 participants (80 and 79 in the albendazole alone and albendazole plus ivermectin arms, respectively) were reassessed for any AEs and TEAEs 24 hours post-treatment. Prior to drug administration, over half of the participants in either treatment arm (64.2% and 62.5% in the albendazole alone and albendazole plus ivermectin arm, respectively) reported symptoms. Fifteen (18.5%) and 11 (13.8%) participants of the albendazole alone arm and the albendazole plus ivermectin arm, respectively, showed at least one TEAE three hours after treatment. Twenty-four hours post-treatment five (6.3%) and eight (10.1%) participants in the albendazole alone and albendazole plus ivermectin arms, respectively, showed at least one TEAE. All observed TEAEs were of mild grading and no medical intervention was needed at any time point.\nThe most common TEAEs were abdominal pain in 19 of 161 (11.8%) at three hours and in 9 of 159 (5.7%) participants at 24h post-treatment, and headache in 6 of 161 (3.7%) at three hours and in 4 of 159 (2.5%) participants 24 hours post-treatment (Fig 2).",
    "Discussion": "Current mass drug administration drugs (albendazole or mebendazole) are not sufficiently efficacious to enable us to achieve the WHO\u2019s 2030 goal of reducing the prevalence of moderate and heavy STH infections to below 2% [12]. T. trichiura infections are especially challenging to treat [6,13], highlighting the need for alternative treatments to prevent drug resistance and meet global targets. While the combination of ivermectin and albendazole proved more efficacious than albendazole alone in various contexts, recent trials in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire contradicted this, revealing no superior performance of the combination over albendazole alone [11,14].\nIn the current clinical trial, we confirmed that in Uganda the combination treatment is more efficacious against T. trichiura than albendazole monotherapy. The CR achieved using the combination therapy was over twice as high as the one with albendazole alone. However, the CRs remained below expectations of findings from other settings in eastern Africa and Asia where CRs above 50% were found for the combination therapy [7,11]. Molecular analyses of T. trichiura eggs and adult worms from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire suggest that the non-responsiveness to ivermectin-albendazole may partly relate to genetic variability of the local Trichuris species, which has recently been identified as a phylogenetically distinct species, nomenclated T. incognita [9,15]. Stool samples containing Trichuris eggs from this clinical trial have been subjected to genetic characterization and revealed the presence of the T. incognita cluster in Uganda as well but in lower rates compared to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (14.5% compared to 45.8% of analysed human-infecting Trichuris species) [16].\nInterestingly, we were also able to demonstrate a benefit of the combination therapy against A. lumbricoides infections. At follow-up, all children receiving ivermectin-albendazole were no longer shedding eggs in their faeces while ten children in the albendazole only arm still did. This is to some extent unexpected, as in previous clinical trials albendazole was usually effective in clearing A. lumbricoides infections [11,17]. Yet, the findings are in line with recent studies that also observed reduced efficacy for this parasite in neighbouring areas, such as Rwanda and Ethiopia [18,19]. The results for hookworm in this trial are inconclusive due to the limited number of hookworm-infected children included. However, a recent meta-analysis concluded that the combination therapy offered neither a significant advantage nor disadvantage in efficacy compared to monotherapy for treating hookworm infections [7].\nAll children tolerated both treatment regimens well and all TEAEs were of transient nature and mild severity. These findings align with those of a literature review and meta-analysis [7]. This is a crucial outcome and encouraging news that supports transitioning from monotherapy to the combination.\nThe strengths of our study include a robust sample size, complete retention with no loss to follow-up, and its implementation in a region of Uganda that is highly representative of the contexts where this combination therapy could have the greatest impact, given the high prevalence of STH [20]. Limitations of our trial include it not having been double-blinded, and having a very low number of hookworm cases, which prevents us from drawing conclusions about the efficacy of either treatment arm for this particular parasite. In addition to its superior efficacy against T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides and its equivalent safety profile, we believe the ivermectin-albendazole combination will offer several other significant advantages over albendazole monotherapy. First, it may help delay the development of drug resistance. Second, by more effectively reducing the worm burden in individuals, the combination therapy could lower transmission rates of these parasites [4]. Finally, the use of ivermectin in addition to albendazole also targets other neglected tropical diseases, such as onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, strongyloidiasis and scabies [21,22].\nIn conclusion, we believe a shift from preventive chemotherapy using albendazole alone to using the combination treatment in Uganda is justified, particularly in districts where T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides infections dominate [20]. The FACE-IT project\u2019s next step will be to explore how to best integrate ivermectin-albendazole co-administration in the existing school-based deworming programme. This will include assessing acceptability among the receiving populations and implementation actors, as well as to document processes and performance of combination treatment distribution compared to routine albendazole mass drug administration."
