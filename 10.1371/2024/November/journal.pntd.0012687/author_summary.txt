Despite several decades of preventive chemotherapy with single-dose albendazole distribution to at-risk populations, soil-transmitted helminth infections remain of public health concern in Uganda. The Ministry of Health has stated interest in the introduction of potentially more efficacious treatment strategies against T. trichiura such as the use of a combination of two deworming drugs (ivermectin and albendazole) instead of only albendazole as currently used. Given significant differences in efficacy between the combination therapy compared to albendazole monotherapy against T. trichiura in different settings, we conducted a randomized clinical trial in two Ugandan primary schools to assess whether in Uganda the combination is more efficacious than albendazole alone. The findings of our study confirmed higher efficacy against T. trichiura in the study area. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. In conclusion, we conceive that the introduction of the combination therapy is advantageous and its introduction into the existing STH control programme should now be evaluated from a recipient and provider perspective.
