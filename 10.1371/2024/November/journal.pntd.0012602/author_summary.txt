Species of Prototheca are achlorophyllous algae widespread in aquatic and wet environments, exhibiting the surprising ability to act as a pathogen of mammals, including humans. With no tendency to self-resolve and the potential for fatal outcomes in immunocompromised patients, protothecosis has emerged as a concerning infection in the last decades. In this study, we identified a Prototheca isolate from a fatal case of systemic protothecosis, using traditional assays, and phylogenetic analysis. Traditional assays identified the pathogen as Prototheca wickerhamii, findings later confirmed by molecular methodologies. Because of its unique classification, clinical diagnosis and laboratory identification are challenging. For instance, the macro morphology of the colonies on culture mimics those in Candida species, a fact contributing to delay therapy. Therefore, the accurate identification and characterization of clinical isolates using molecular methodologies may have a positive impact on the diagnosis and treatment of this unusual infection.
