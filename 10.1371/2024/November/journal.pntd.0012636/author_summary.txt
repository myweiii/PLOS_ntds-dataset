Plasmodium vivax malaria in pregnancy is also associated with several adverse outcomes, even in low-transmission regions such as South America. However, to our knowledge, no study has previously investigated the link between the humoral immune response due to previous exposure to P. vivax and the immunological profile during pregnancy infection and its association with poor pregnancy outcomes. In this study, after applying exclusion criteria, 242 mother-child pairs were evaluated for different immunological markers of malaria exposure in an endemic area in the Brazilian Amazon. We showed that previous exposure to P. vivax, through the humoral immune response to the PvMSP119 antigen, can exacerbate the inflammatory response during gestational malaria and is associated with increased parasitemia, reduced maternal weight gain and premature delivery. These findings help to understand the association between anti-PvMSP119 antibodies, considered exposure marker, and the maternal peripheral inflammatory profile throughout pregnancy, bringing important implications for understanding the immunobiology of the disease.
