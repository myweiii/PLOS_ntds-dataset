In Ghana, schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infections are of major public health problems in children. The aim of this study was to identify challenges in achieving sustainable coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) for the control of STH and SCH, and to investigate potential avenues for expanding its use among the populace residing in hard-to-reach communities. Focus group discussions (FGDs) with community members and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with key informants were held to address these aims. The study revealed the participants expressed willingness to participate in the MDA program, however, lack of community drug distributors (CDDs), inadequate and misleading information on MDA activities, and widespread worry about the negative effects of MDA drugs were major challenges identified. Transitioning from SCH and STH control to elimination goals requires extensive health education, and politicians and policymakers must work together to provide scarce and sanitary infrastructure in endemic communities.
