Arboviruses are a significant threat to public health because of their epidemic and zoonotic potential. The geographical distribution of mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile Fever has expanded over the last decades. Countries of the Mediterranean region are not spared. In this context, surveillance of the circulation of such viruses needs to be achieved before the appearing of human or animal cases. The aim of our study was to use innovative and highly efficient tools to highlight the circulation of arboviruses in mosquito vectors, animal reservoirs or exposed animals in Algeria. A total of 1,658 mosquitoes belonging to nine different species were collected and screened for arboviruses usinghighthroughput chips based on the BioMark Dynamic arrays system, capable of screening various arboviruses in a single experiment. Moreover, we analyzed 389 blood samples from equids and poultry using 3 different serologic methods. Our results bring, for the first time in Algeria, evidence of the cryptic circulation of 5 arboviruses: West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Usutu virus, Sindbis virus and for the first time out of the Asian region, Banna virus.
This approach, as an early warning system, is enabling for an early detection of pathogens circulation above-threshold before disease appearance in humans.
