    "Introduction": "Algeria as the largest country in Africa (2 381 741 km2) covers different bioclimatic zones from humid to Sahelian presenting a high level of biodiversity. It experienced outbreaks of different arthropod-borne diseases such as malaria [1,2], leishmaniasis [3], plague [4] and rickettsiosis [5]. With 53 species described [6], mosquitoes constitute an important group of vectors, transmitting malaria [2] and multiple arboviruses [7\u201310]. Among arboviruses, West Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated from a pool of Culex spp. mosquitoes in 1968 in Djanet in the south-east of Algeria [7]. Later, in 1994, a WNV epidemic was reported in Tinerkouk oasis in the south-west of Algeria, with 50 human cases and eight deaths mainly among children [11]. Neighboring countries also experienced WNV outbreaks, Tunisia in 1997 (111 human cases, 8 fatalities) [12] and Morocco in 1996 and 2010 (horse encephalitis) [12,13]. Later, in 2012, a retrospective serosurvey in Algiers and surrounding areas highlighted specific anti-WNV IgG in 11 out of 164 human samples tested [14]. During the same year, a fatal neuro-invasive case was reported for the first time in northern Algeria, in the province of Jijel [15]. In 2018, the WNV lineage 1 was detected in a pool of Cx. perexiguus collected in Timimoun [8].\nWhile equids and humans are dead-end hosts with short-lasting and low level viraemia that do not allow mosquitoes infection [16], birds (resident and migrating) are resistant and play the role of reservoirs [17,18]. Migratory birds pass through Algeria coming from sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and Europe and stopover in wetlands. Passerines are considered the main competent hosts for WNV and Usutu virus (USUV), a closely genetically related virus [19]. Some wild birds, and specifically passerids, raptors and Charadriiforme aquatic birds generally develop a viraemia greater than 105 PFU/mL, capable of infecting Culex vectors [18,20,21]. WNV and USUV, two flaviviruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family, share eco-epidemiologic features and transmission cycles. During WNV outbreaks in New York City in 2000, tens of thousands of birds of 54 native bird species died, mostly crows [22, 23]. USUV has been shown to infect 62 bird species derived from 18 orders and 26 families [24]. Sentinel birds, like chickens and pigeons have been used for decades to monitor arthropod-borne virus circulation [25]; they develop antibodies after infection without becoming highly infectious to Cx. pipiens vectors [24]. Globally, WNV and USUV surveillance includes the detection of clinical cases in humans and equids (horses and donkeys), as well as programmed serological surveillance in equids in addition to survey in resident and migratory birds, and the viral screening of mosquitoes [26].\nSeveral Culex mosquito species are involved in WNV and USUV transmission in wild or captive avifauna [25] and in the transfer to susceptible mammals in particular, humans (WNV, USUV) and horses (WNV) [27]. Cx. pipiens, a species feeding on birds and humans, is considered to be the main vector in Europe [20]. In Algeria, WNV was detected in Culex spp. [7] and particularly, Cx. perexiguus [8]. In 2017, four pools of Cx. perexiguus and six pools of Cx. pipiens were found infected with Sindbis virus (SINV) [10]; this alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, causes human diseases in Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia [28]. Like WNV and USUV, the primary vectors of SINV are ornithophilic Culex (Cx.) mosquitoes [28].\nCulex-transmitted arboviruses including migratory birds as hosts have been circulating in the region, including Algeria, for a long time [9]. Regarding the increasing number of WNV foci in the world, the situation may have evolved in Algeria, especially knowing that most of infected cases are asymptomatic or present Flu-like symptoms and then are misdiagnosed. In this study, we investigated the current situation of arboviruses circulation among vectors and reservoirs in Algeria. What has changed is the frequency of emergences and the number of human cases, most likely related to intensive urbanization creating the conditions for mosquitoes to proliferate in close proximity to birds and humans [29]. Using highly sensitive tools, we investigated the circulation of arboviruses in collected mosquitoes in two different bioclimatic zones of Algeria. A novel high throughput surveillance method has been designed using a microfluidic system (BioMark dynamic array system, Standard Biotools) capable of performing parallel real-time PCRs using 96.96 chips resulting in 9,216 individual reactions and detecting 95 different genotypes/serotypes of 37 viral species [30]. Additionally, serological analysis based on IgG detection on blood samples of equines and poultry was performed using three complementary methods: cELISA, MNT and MIA.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThe Institute Pasteur of Algeria has received accreditation from the Algerian Ministry of Health and Agriculture to perform experiments and blood sampling on live animals in compliance with the World Animal Health Organization guiding principles on animal welfare included in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code [31]. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Institute Pasteur of Algeria. Verbal informed consents were obtained from animal owners and director of El Kala Zoo prior to the collection of blood samples.\n\n\nStudy area\nStudy sites were selected based on documented circulation of WNV in the country [11,32]. Thereby, two sites with episodic proven WNV circulation were chosen: (i) El Kala in the coastal humid region at El-Tarf department (36\u00b053\u2019N, 8\u00b026\u2019E; rainfall of 900\u20131200 mm/year) and (ii) Tinerkouk (30\u00b017\u2019N, 0\u00b056\u2019E), Timimoun (29\u00b012\u2019N, 0\u00b024\u2019E) and Aougrout (28\u00b050\u2019N, 0\u00b059\u2019E) in the Saharan desert region at Adrar department (rainfall of 100 mm/year) (Fig 1).\nThe map was built using the open source map site: Qgis 3.28.13 Software(https://qgis.org/license/), Shape files: Algeria subnational administrative boundaries: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-dza?https://data.humdata.org/dataset/3d17274d-0812-4b21-b87a-4854af4eb244/resource/34f317e5-7de9-4e1b-a457-91ab786dc952/download/dza_admbnda_unhcr2020_shp.zip.\nIn each bioclimatic region, different habitats were chosen: urban (center of the city), sub-urban (outskirts of the city) and rural (outside the city). This mosquito sampling strategy was implemented to be exhaustive in collecting all species of mosquitoes present in the studied sites.\n\n\nMosquitoes\nAdult mosquitoes were collected inside animal shelters and human habitations during four consecutive nights using eight CDC light traps (John W. Hock, Gainesville, FL) baited with carbon dioxide dry ice in July and October 2018 and October 2019 (from 7.00 pm to 7.00 am). These collecting periods corresponded to the period of maximum mosquito activity (highest densities) in Algeria. Caught mosquitoes were identified alive on ice using the morphological keys of Brunhes et al. 2000 [33]. Females with the presence of blood meal in their abdomens were not taken into account for viral screening. Once identified, specimens were immediately dissected by separating the abdomen from the remaining part of the body (RPB). RPB screening was carried out for two reasons: i) to identify the infected mosquitoes in each positive pools to estimate the infectious rate and ii) to identify the probably competent vector for the detected arbovirus.\nTen abdomens from the same species were pooled in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. The corresponding RPB were placed individually in 0.2 mL Eppendorf tubes. Both parts were stored rapidly in liquid nitrogen container until arriving to the laboratory where they were stored at -80\u00b0C until RNA extraction.\n\n\nRNA extraction\nTotal RNAs were extracted from each pool using the Nucleospin RNA II extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France). Pools were ground in 600 \u03bcL of L15 medium with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) using an homogenizer (Retsch, Germany) operating at 30 Hz/s for 3 min. After centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 6 min at +4\u00b0C, total RNA per pool was eluted in 50 \u03bcL of RNase free water and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. When a virus was detected in pools of abdomens, the RPB (head/thorax) of individual mosquitoes composing each pool were homogenized in 300 \u03bcL of L 15 medium with 2% FCS using the homogenizer 24 Dual (Bertin, France) at 5,500 rpm for 20 s. Then, total RNAs were extracted from 150 \u03bcL of homogenates using the Nucleospin RNA II extract kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and 150 \u03bcL were stored at -80 C\u00b0 for attempts to isolate the virus. Total RNA per sample was eluted in 40 \u03bcL of RNase free water and stored at -80 C\u00b0 until use.\n\n\nReverse transcription and cDNA pre-amplification\nRNAs were transcribed to cDNA by reverse transcription using the qScript cDNA Supermix kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Quanta Biosciences, Beverly, USA). For cDNA pre-amplification, the Perfecta Preamp Supermix (Quanta Biosciences, Beverly, USA) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. These two procedures were performed according to the protocols described by Moutailler et al. (2019) [30].\n\n\nArboviruses screening by High-Throughput Real-Time Microfluidic PCRs\ncDNAs were screened for detection of 37 arboviruses in the BioMark Dynamic arrays system (Standard Biotools, CA, USA). Amplifications were performed using 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-and black hole quencher (BHQ1)-labeled TaqMan probes with TaqMan Gene expression master mix (Applied Biosystems, France). Thermal cycling conditions were: 2 min at 50\u00b0C, 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 2-step amplification of 15 sec at 95\u00b0C, and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. Data was acquired on the BioMark Real-Time PCR System and analyzed using the Fluidigm Real-time PCR analysis software to obtain crossing point values. One negative water control was included per chip. To determine if inhibitors present in the sample could inhibit the real-time PCR, a strain of Escherichia coli was added to each sample as an internal inhibition control. Among the 149 primers/probe sets detailed in Moutailler et al. (2019) [30], 95 sets targeting 95 different genotypes/serotypes of 37 viral species were chosen for our screening (list primers/probs in S1 Additional information). Positive samples were confirmed by the iTaq Universal Probes One-Step Kit (Biorad, CA, USA). The 20\u2009\u03bcL reaction mix contained 10\u2009\u03bcL of iTaq universal probes reaction mix (2\u00d7), 10\u2009\u03bcM of each primer, 3\u2009\u03bcL of cDNA. A Biorad T100 thermal cycler (Biorad, CA, USA) was used, and the cycling conditions were: 95\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, and 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, 60\u00b0C for 20\u2009s. Once the detection of virus is confirmed by qRT PCR, using specific primers and probes listed in S1 Table, a screening of corresponding individual RBP was performed by real-time PCR.\n\n\nViral serodiagnosis\nAnimal blood sampling.In total, 389 sera were collected from equids and poultry during October 2018 and October 2019. Equids, belonged to domestic horses and donkeys, and sampled poultry to domestic chickens and ducks, and exotic birds in El Kala zoo, such as peacocks, pheasants and guinea fowls from the El Kala zoo. During our study, we did not sample any exotic animals in the Saharan sites because there was no zoo in Timimoun nor in Tinerkouk. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein of horses and the ulnar vein of poultry, centrifuged for separation of serum and stored at +4\u00b0C or -20\u00b0C until being processed. All sampled equines were healthy and were not vaccinated against WNV.\nAll sera were first screened by cELISA to detect anti-flavivirus antibodies. Positive samples were then confirmed by virus microneutralization test (MNT) to detect WNV and USUV neutralizing antibodies specifically and the microsphere immunoassay (MIA) which allows to distinguish between WNV and USUV exposure through the binding of animal sera on beads coupled to WNV and USUV specific antigens.\n\nCompetitive ELISA.The serological diagnosis was initiated using a cELISA test (ID screen WNV competition ELISA kit, ID Vet, France) on poultry and equids sera samples. Interpretation was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The threshold value for considering a serum as positive was % OD sample/negative control (%S/N) \u2264 40% as recommended by the manufacturer. Those with a 40% <%S/N \u2264 50% or less and greater than 40% were considered doubtful, and those with a %S/N > 50% were considered negative. This test has been used to give an indication of the presence or absence of anti-WNV antibodies in sera, but cross-reactions with other flaviviruses may occur; consequently, reactive sera were considered flavivirus-positive [34].\n\nMicrosphere immunoassay.Equids sera positive samples on cELISA were screened by flavivirus microsphere immunoassay (MIA) as described by Beck et al. (2015) [35]. Purified recombinant envelope domain III (rEDIII) proteins and non structural 1 (NS1) of WNV and USUV were used for the capture of specific IgG antibodies. A recombinant soluble ectodomain of WNV envelope (E) glycoprotein (WNV.sE) which identifies exposure by flaviviruses in the same way as the competitive ELISA test and WNV.EDIII, USUV.EDIII. EDIII, WNV.NS1 and USUV.NS1 were coupled to microspheres using the Bio-Plex Amine coupling kit (Biorad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions as described in Beck et al. (2015) [35]. Five micrograms of WNV.sE, 10\u03bcg of WNV.NS1 and USUV.NS1or TBEV.EDIII or 50 \u03bcg of WNV.EDIII and USUV.EDIII were coupled with the beads. The sera (diluted 1/100) were then tested with the MIA technology using an equimolar mixture of the five beads as previously described in Beck et al. (2015) [35]. For each antigen, the diagnostic cut off was determined from the mean median of fluorescence (MFI) values of 66 horse-negative sera plus 3 standard deviations of the mean. In cases of positive reactions with several rEDIIIs or NS1s, an animal was considered infected with WNV if WNV.rEDIII or WNV.NS1generated an MFI at least two-fold greater than that generated with USUV.rEDIII or USUV.NS1 respectively. If a two-fold difference could not be achieved, the sample was considered to be infected with WNV or USUV. The sample was considered positive for an undetermined Flavivirus if it reacted with WNV.sE but not with any of the rEDIIIs or NS1s.\n\nVirus microneutralization tests.All ELISA positive samples from equids and poultry were further investigated through virus-specific microneutralisation tests (MNTs) against flaviviruses reported in the area where the sera were collected. These samples were investigated through MNT against WNV and USUV for the detection of specific neutralizing antibodies against WNV (strain Is98, Genbank ID AF481864.1, provided by P. Despr\u00e8s, IPP) and USUV (strain France 2018, Genbank ID MT863562.1) following the protocol described in Beck et al. (2015) [35]. A serum was considered positive if cells were protected at the 1:10 serum dilution for WNV and USUV. Owing to cross-neutralization for members belonging to the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex, such as WNV and USUV, we identified the infecting Flavivirus, WNV or USUV, by considering the virus with the highest neutralization capacity, and with neutralization titers that differed by at least a four-fold dilution factor [35]. If this latter condition was not met, the serum was considered positive for WNV or USUV.\n\n\n\nSequencing and phylogenetic analysis\nPrimers were designed with primer design program Primer 3 to target the segment 12 of the BAV genome: BaV-S12-P5-for (5\u2019-TGTGGGTTGTGAGGGTCCAA-3\u2019) and BaV-S12-P5-rev (5\u2019-AGTAGCATA AGATGCATGGCG-3\u2019). Classic PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 \u03bcL containing 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs) mixture, 1\u00d7 PCR buffer, 0.05 U/\u03bcL of Taq DNA Polymerase, 0.2 \u03bcMof each primer, and 5 \u03bcL of genomic DNA. The PCR reactions were run in a Biorad T100 thermal cycler (Biorad, CA, USA)using the following reaction conditions: 95\u00b0C for 3 min for initial denaturation, 40cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and then visualized using UV light.\nThe 12th segment genes of 40 BAV strains and four other representatives of Seadornaviruses (Banna-like virus, Kadipiro virus, Liao ning virus and Mangshi virus) were selected based on samples used in previous studies [36,37].\nMultiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis based on the maximum likelihood method, and the general time reversible (GTR) model were conducted, using MEGA v10.2.6 [38]. All positions with less than 90% of site coverage were eliminated, i.e. fewer than 10% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were allowed at any position (partial deletion option). There was a total of 666 positions in the final dataset. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Joining and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the maximum composite likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+G, parameter = 4.8623)).Statistical support of phylogenetic tree obtained was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates and bootstrap values for each node are given if > 50%.\nIn addition, the patristic or phyletic distances within and between taxa of BAV groups were calculated. Pairwise patristic distances correspond to the amount of genetic change between any two sequences as depicted by the branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree.",
    "Results": "Screening of arboviruses in mosquitoes\nA total of 1,658 mosquitoes belonging to six genera and nine species collected in the four study sites were processed. 910, 452, 275 and 21 female mosquitoes were collected in El Kala, Timimoun, Tinerkouk and Aougrout respectively (S1 Fig; S2 Table). Nine species were identified; the most abundant species were Cx. pipiens sl. (56.5%) and Cx. perexiguus (27.5%), the remaining females were Aedes caspius (9.3%), Anopheles labranchiae (2.2%), Coquillettidia richiardii (1.8%), Uranotaenia ungiculata (1.3%), Cq. buxtoni (1.1%), Culiseta longiareolata (0.2%) and An. d\u2019thali (0.1%) (S1 Fig).\nThe 1,658 field-collected mosquitoes were grouped into 180 pools for viral screening. Viral detections using the BioMark microfluidic system showed the presence of four arboviruses: CHIKV, USUV, SINV and Banna Virus (BAV) (S2 Fig and Table 1). Three pools from El Kala province, urban Cx. pipiens, rural Cx. perexiguus and rural An. labranchiae, were found positive for CHIKV. Moreover, two pools of Cx. pipiens from urban habitat of El Kala province were found positive for BAV, whilst one pool of Cx. perexiguus from rural habitat of El Kala province and one pool of Cx. pipiens from urban habitat from Timimoun province were found positive for USUV. One pool of Cx. perexiguus originating from Tinerkouk province was found positive for SINV. When analyzing RPB (head-thorax) of individual mosquitoes, we found one USUV-infected mosquito, one SINV-infected mosquito and five BAV-infected mosquitoes. No RPB were infected in the three positive CHIKV pools.\nTwo pools among 28 of Cx. pipiens from urban site of El Kala province tested positive for BAV, representing 5 positive mosquitoes for an infection rate of 1.8% (5/280), whilst one of 50 pools of Cx. perexiguus from rural site of El Kala province and one of 32 pools of Cx. pipiens from urban site from Timimoun province were found positive for USUV. However, the unique pool of Cx. perexiguus originating from Tinerkouk province was found positive for SINV. When analyzing RPB (head-thorax) of individual mosquitoes, we found one USUV-infected mosquito, one SINV-infected mosquito and five BAV-infected mosquitoes representing an infection rate of 0.2% (1/418), 12.5% (1/8) and 1.8% (5/280) respectively. No RPB were infected in the three positive CHIKV pools, although detected, it was probably due to positive blood meal as Culex is not a suspected vector.\nFor BAV, one pool (29K18) consisted of three positive RPBs with lowest cycle threshold (Ct) values of 17.5, 30 and 35 and the second one (30K18) revealed two positive RPBs with higher Ct values: 36 and 36. The RNA extract from Cx. pipiens RPB showing a high detection level (Ct: 17.5) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA and amplified by classic PCR. The obtained amplicon of 600 bp length was sequenced by Eurofins (Nantes, France), using Sanger sequencing system, and blasted confirming the BAV (GenBank acc no. OQ305924).\n\n\nSerology\nIn total, 389 sera were collected and first screened by cELISA to determine WNV seropositivity. Out of 204 positive samples, 111 and 93 from El Kala and the three Saharan sites respectively were found positive for flavivirus antibodies (Table 2). In El Kala, 74 of equids, including 21 horses and 53 donkeys, and 37 of birds, including 18 chickens, seven ducks, five peacocks, four pheasants and three guineas fowl were flavivirus positive. In the three Saharan sites, 25 horses were flavivirus positive in Timimoun, two horses in Tinerkouk, and two donkeys in Aougrout. Only chickens were sampled in Timimoun with 64 animals flavivirus positive.\nAll ELISA-positive samples were screened by MNT (Table 2).WNV-specific antibodies were identified by MNT in the majority of flavivirus-exposed animals. In El Kala, 52 equids, including 16 horses and 36 donkeys, and 26 birds, including 14 chickens (seven ducks, one peacock, two pheasants, two guineas fowl were found WNV positive. In the three Saharan sites, 18 horses and 21 chickens in Timimoun, two horses in Tinerkouk, and one donkey in Aougrout were WNV-positive. Interestingly, we found two chickens from Timimoun USUV-positive by MNT (Table 2).\nMIA using EDIII marker showed that in El Kala site, 15 of horses and 25 of donkeys were WNV positive antibodies, and one horse and one donkey were USUV positive antibodies. Moreover, we found that four horses and 12 donkeys were WNV or USUV positive antibodies, and 11 donkeys were undetermined flaviviruses positive antibodies (Table 3). In Timimoun, we showed that 17 of horses were WNV positive antibodies, three WNV or USUV positive antibodies and three undetermined flaviviruses positive antibodies. In Tinerkouk, only two horses were WNV positive antibodies (Table 3).\nMIA using NS1 protein confirmed MIA results obtained with EDIII-coated beads, generally identifying WNV exposure in cELISA-positive horses (El Kala:15, Timimoun:17, Tinerkouk: 2). Moreover, in donkeys, WNV exposure were more efficiently confirmed by MIA with NS1 than with EDIII: 45 donkeys in El Kala were found infected by WNV, three by WNV or USUV and three by another flavivirus with NS1-MIA, while25 animals only were WNV-positive, 12 were found infected by WNV or USUV and 11 by another flavivirus in EDIII.MIA (Table 3). The percentage calculated was based on total sample numbers, assuming all cELISA negative would also be negative by MNT and MIAs.\n\n\nTaxonomic status of Banna virus from Algeria\nTo clarify the taxonomic status of Banna virus from Algeria, similarity values and phylogenetic relationships between sequences of the 12th segment of the isolate BAV-like-Algeria-2018 (OQ305924) and other BAVs were analyzed.\nSimilarity values of OQ305924 with nucleotide sequences of BAVs from different genotypes were low, from 80.34% to 81.37% with type A1, from 80.17% to 82.08% with type A2, and from 81.71% to 81.88% with type B (S3 Table). Similarity values were even smaller with MH521275 and QX884648 sequences of the type C, 77.4% and 79.07%, respectively.\nThe maximum likelihood (ML) tree revealed that our sequence clustered together with segment 12 of Banna viruses (Fig 2). The most closely related group of BAVs with our sequence was the group (genotype) C, represented by viruses isolated from An. sinensis in Hubei, China. Their relationship was supported by 92% bootstrap as shown in the Fig 2 (Fig 2). However, patristic distances between our sequence and the 12th segment of BAVs of group C (GTR dist = 0.42) remain much higher than pairwise distances within and between the other groups (S4 Table). These results suggest that the virus, BAV-like-Algeria-2018 isolated from Cx. pipiens in Algeria, formed a separate branch from other previously reported BAVs.\nSequences were aligned by MUSCLE. The phylogenetic tree was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method, the General Time Reversible model and bootstrap method. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-6246.98) is shown.",
    "Discussion": "To our knowledge, this is the first report of co-circulation of multiple arboviruses in Algeria. Indeed, our study highlighted the circulation of five different arboviruses in the studied sites, BAV, CHIKV, SINV, USUV, and WNV. Our investigations were focused on sites where the circulation of arboviruses had been documented many years ago, and specifically WNV, as evidenced by high anti-WNV seropositivity detected in equids (42%) and in domestic poultry (21.9%). After analyzing animal sera with competitive flavivirus ELISA, we improved our screening using more specific serological methods, namely MNT and MIA, which allowed to confirm that flaviviruses such as WNV and USUV are circulating in Algeria, probably for many years. Despite the non-reporting of WNV clinical cases in humans or equids, our investigations on 389 animal samples showed that 52.4% (204/389) were cELISA positive indicating an important circulation of Flaviviruses at El Kala and Saharan studied sites; 111 (54.4%) and 93 (45.6%) from El Kala and the three Saharan sites respectively (see Table 2); MNT analysis indicated that WNV was the main flavivirus circulating in both sites.\nGlobally, flavivirus seropositivity for equids and poultry were 59.2% (103/174) and 47% (101/215) respectively which are significantly higher than in other neighboring countries such as in Morocco (33.7% in horses) [39] and in Iran (16.66% in equids and 13.75% in birds) [40]. In 2014, Lafri et al. (2017) [32] showed that in El Kala, out of 222 donkeys and 41 horses, 16 (39%) horses and 32 (14.4%) donkeys were WNV-antibodies positive, showing that WNV circulation has intensified since then. Likewise, from November 2014 to February 2015, Medrouh et al. (2020) [19] showed that in Kabylia, north-center of Algeria, 12.5% and 1.5% of song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus) had been exposed to WNV, these values are much lower than seropositivity in birds detected in our study (between 36.8% and 75%; Table 2).\nDespite high seroprevalences, there were no clinical cases detected among tested birds. Repetitive contacts with WNV introduced from migratory birds could have led to an acquired immunity of domestic and exotic encaged birds. This scenario is different comparing the one in North America in 1999 where WNV originated from Israel [41] caused an important mortality among native birds, especially Corvids, Sparrows and even exotic animals in New York City [42]. Millions of birds died from WNV infection and population declines of >50% have been observed for several bird species [43].\nInterestingly, anti-USUV antibodies were detected by MNT in two chickens in the Timimoun site. This is the first report of USUV in Algeria. Our results show the presence of two USUV-positive (1.5%) chickens from Timimoun and MIA helped at evidencing two USUV-positive (1.5%) equids, one horse and one donkey from El Kala site. Medrouh et al. (2020) [19] found that in Kabylia region, north central of Algeria, WNV was circulating among wild birds (7.8%) but not USUV. This virus first identified in south Africa in 1959 by Mcintosh (1985) [44], was reported in several other African countries in addition to Algeria: Central African Republic, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Tunisia and Morocco [45].\nWe used three complementary techniques to detect flaviviruses, cELISA, MNT, and MIA. cELISA is the first-line method because of its ease of execution. MNT is the gold standard assay for the confirmation of exposure by flaviviruses as it identifies antibodies neutralizing a specific flavivirus. However, MIA proved to be more informative than MNT when combining EDIII and NS1 antigens. Indeed, the flavivirus MIA, which was developed for the detection of exposure to flaviviruses in horse sera proved to be more sensitive than MNT, recognizing 6 more exposure to WNV and 2 USUV exposure in equids (one positive horse and one positive donkey for EDIII-coupled beads and the same positive horse using NS1-coupled beads). This method needs more developments to be used on avian species and other arboviruses [34]. The flavivirus MIA protocol needs improvements for serological diagnosis of flaviviruses: using a wider range of proteins and including nonstructural proteins (NS) such as NS1 or NS5 to distinguish vaccinated from naturally infected animals or recent from old infections. MIA can be developed for flaviviruses circulating in other animal species [35].\nWe combined serological surveys with entomological investigations. We used a newly developed high-throughput virus-detection assay based on microfluidic real-time PCRs able to detect 64 mosquito-borne viruses in mosquitoes [30]. Out of 180 pools analyzed, eight pools of mosquitoes were found positive for four different species of arboviruses. We detected BAV in two pools of Cx. pipiens in urban El Kala, CHIKV in three pools of mosquitoes (Cx. pipiens in urban El Kala, Cx. perexiguus in rural El Kala, and An. labranchiae in rural El Kala), SINV in one pool of Cx. perexiguus in peri-urban Tinerkouk and USUV in two pools (Cx. perexiguus in rural El Kala and Cx. pipiens in urban Timimoun). The four viruses belong to three different families, USUV to Flaviviridae (like WNV), CHIKV and SINV to Togaviridae and BAV to Reoviridae.\nThe detection of a virus in mosquitoes does not infer on their capacity to transmit this virus through mosquito bite. Vector competence for WNV is well documented for Culex species: Cx. antennatus, Cx. pipiens, and Cx. univittatus in Egypt and Israel [46,47]; Cx. quinquefasciatus in India [48]; Cx. univittatus, Cx. theileri, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Cx. neavei in South Africa [49,50]; and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Pakistan [51]. In Algeria, WNV was first detected in a pool of Culex spp. mosquitoes in 1968 in Djanet, extreme south-east of Algeria [7]. The competence of Cx. pipiens from three biogeographical sites (North, Center and South) of Algeria was demonstrated for two viruses, WNV and RVFV (Rift Valley Fever Virus) [52]. WNV lineage 1 was detected in a pool of Cx. perexiguus from Aougrout, south of Algeria [8]. Nevertheless, despite a high seropositivity of WNV detected in equids and chickens, we did not detect WNV in mosquitoes while CHIKV, USUV and SINV were detected in Cx. perexiguus. This vector is considered as the main vector of WNV in Egypt, Israel [53], Portugal, Italy and Spain [54,55]. Cx. perexiguus is also incriminated as a potential vector of USUV and SINV [54,56,57]. Usually, the ornithophilic species, Cx. pipiens, is considered to be the main vector of USUV in Europe [58] besides other mosquitoes (Cx. modestus, Cx. neavei, Cx. perexiguus, Cx. perfuscus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. univittatus, Ae. albopictus, Ae. japonicus, Ae. minutus, An. maculipennis, Cs. annulata, Mansonia africana, Ma. aurites, Ochlerotatus caspius and Oc. detritus) [20]. Cx. pipiens, Cx. neavei and Cx. quinquefasciatus are experimentally competent to transmit USUV [58\u201360].\nWe detected SINV in Cx. perexiguus in Tinerkouk. Like CHIKV, SINV causes arthralgia and myalgia. It is reported in Eurasia, Africa and Australia with clinical manifestations mainly observed in northern Europe and South Africa [28]. This virus has been mainly isolated from Cx. pipiens but also Cx. torrentium, Cx. univittatus, and Cx. theileri [61]. In Algeria, in 2017, Ayhan et al. (2022) [10] reported for the first time the presence of SINV in Cx. pipiens and Cx. perexiguus; a SINV named SINV-Algeria_2017-Cx. perexiguus has been fully sequenced (GenBank accession number: OK644705). CHIKV has also been detected in Cx. perexiguus abdomens but not in head-thorax suggesting that this vector took a blood meal on a CHIKV-infected host in the El Kala site with no evidence of viral dissemination and transmission by the mosquito. CHIKV was also detected in abdomens of Cx. pipiens and An. labranchiae but not in head-thorax. CHIKV circulates actively in the northern part of Algeria and the implication of both Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes in transmission can be ruled out. On the other hand, the omnipresence of Ae. albopictus since 2010 in northern Algeria, can be the cause of future CHIKV emergences [62]. Further studies using BG sentinel traps targeting Ae. albopictus will be more informative.\nAgainst all expectations, we detected BAV from Cx. pipiens. s.l. in urban El Kala. Originating from Asia [63], BAV has never been detected outside its natural range of distribution. RNA was detected in pools of abdomens and then, confirmed in head-thorax leading to identify five BAV-infected mosquitoes. We used strongly positive RNA extract (pool 29K18, Ct = 17.5) for sequencing.\nPhylogenetic analysis shows that our strain of BAV-like detected in Algeria is part of a distinct and new branch of BAV species. Our strain is closely related to the Indonesian and Chinese BAV sequences rather than to other viruses (e.g. Balaton virus, Kadipiro virus, Liao ning virus, Mangshi virus) (Fig 2). Further studies are needed to isolate more strains of this virus in the same site and to perform whole genome sequencing to confirm that our strain belongs to a new group of BAV.\nThis virus has been probably introduced in El Kala by infected persons who travelled recently in Asia. Asian workers in construction and public works travel regularly between Algeria and China.\nOur study emphasizes a cryptic circulation of multiple arboviruses in Algeria, first by detecting them in mosquitoes and second by serological confirmation in animals. The use of discriminant tools, the high-throughput screening arboviruses system applied for mosquitoes [64,65] and the MIA serological method for animals [34] will allow to define more precisely the circulation of arboviruses and then, to predict future emergences. Both methods can be adapted for screening more pathogens (bacteria, parasites in addition to virus) in different specimens (other taxa, additional tissues,\u2026) [66]. Efforts should be invested in developing serological markers adapted to MIA for viral screening in birds and equines. Furthermore, our study should be extended to migratory birds for the detection and isolation of WNV and USUV. Sustained surveillance of animals and mosquitoes using discriminant tools will help to detect emergence at the earliest stages and to react quickly to contain the spread."
