In our study, we explored how the connections between villages in the Amazon region can help us better understand the spread of malaria. By examining how people move between these villages, we identified key locations that play a significant role in the spread of the disease. We used data from 2011 to 2018, collected from the Peruvian Ministry of Health, focusing on the Loreto department. Our analysis involved 1608 villages, where we computed and tested 24 different connectivity metrics to see which one best predicted malaria cases. We found that the "betweenness centrality" metric, which measures how often a village serves as a bridge between others, was the most reliable predictor of malaria incidence. Interestingly, we discovered that villages with higher connectivity tended to have more malaria cases. This trend was even more pronounced in areas with stronger malaria control efforts. Our findings suggest that current malaria control strategies could be improved by focusing not just on individual villages with high malaria rates but also on those that are well-connected to others. This approach could lead to more effective interventions and a better understanding of how diseases like malaria spread in rural areas.
