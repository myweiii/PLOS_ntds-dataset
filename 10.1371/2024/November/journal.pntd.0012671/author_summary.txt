Mosquito control authorities have faced major emergencies, but they lacked access to analytical tools for guiding the planning of mosquito control strategies and outbreak response efforts. This deficiency has not only impeded their situational awareness but has also hindered their ability to make informed decisions regarding intervention planning to respond to Aedes-borne disease outbreaks. Our study addresses this need by developing an analytical tool that forecasts Aedes aegypti relative abundance 1 to 4 weeks ahead. Our forecasts were consistently accurate and precise for all analyzed study sites, forecasting horizon, and for periods with medium/high Ae. Aegypti activity. Our results indicate that our analytical tool can be used to guide mosquito control operations, ultimately reducing the risk of Aedes-borne disease outbreaks.
