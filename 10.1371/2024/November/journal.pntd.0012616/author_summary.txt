Dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are important arboviral infections that cause endemic febrile disease specially among children in Kenya. Since there is no active surveillance for DENV and CHIKV infections in Kenya, the actual burden of these infections and their associated risk factors remains unknown. In this longitudinal cohort study spanning over a period of five years between 2014â€“2018, we investigate relationships between household, socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral risk factors for DENV and CHIKV seropositivity and seroconversion in four settlements in Kenya and describe the temporal patterns of seroconversion among the tested participants. The study emphasizes the existence of active DENV and CHIKV disease transmission in Kenya. The results also highlight older age, presence of water containers and trash on the housing compounds to increase the odds of DENV and CHIKV seropositivity and seroconversion whereas a higher wealth index decreased the odds of DENV and CHIKV seropositivity and seroconversion. The results of our study link ongoing CHIKV and DENV exposure in Kenya to lower income and resources, underscoring the need to combat inequity and poverty and enhance ongoing surveillance for arboviruses in Kenya.
