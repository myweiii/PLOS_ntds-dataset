Advancements in scientific research tools in areas of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases of public health importance are crucial to understanding the epidemiology of these diseases. Hantaviruses are not an exception. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) are the two main rodent-borne diseases of public health importance. However, bat- and shrew-borne hantaviruses have also been reported with serological detection of Thottapalayam and Altai shrew-borne hantavirus infections in humans in Sri Lanka and Thailand. Based on these recent public health discoveries, antigenic development and evaluation are part of the key components in efforts put forward to understand the epidemiology of these viruses. This study provides researchers with the first antigenic comparison between selected bat- and shrew-borne hantaviruses using their rN proteins with their application in screening epidemiological samples (Bat sera) from Zambia. Hence, this comprehensive study can serve as the basis for further scientific collaboration within research communities.
