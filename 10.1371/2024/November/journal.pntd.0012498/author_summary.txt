A retrospective analysis of surveillance data was conducted to explore the epidemic characteristics and spatiotemporal dynamic distribution of HFRS in Hubei province from 2005 to 2022. The effects of meteorological factors on HFRS incidence were then explored by the Geodetector model. The HFRS incidence remained fluctuating at a low level during 2005–2015, followed an increasing trend during 2015–2018, and then decreased during 2018–2022. HFRS cases were concentrated in the center of Hubei province, with a transmission to southern areas. It is necessary to strengthen surveillance, rodent control and vaccination in these high-risk areas, to prevent the occurrence of outbreaks. Wind speed and mean temperature were significantly associated with HFRS distribution in Hubei province. The information is helpful for the exploration of early warning systems.
