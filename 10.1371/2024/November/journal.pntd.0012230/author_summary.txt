G. lamblia is an intestinal protozoan having mixed associations with acute gastroenteritis, yet positive associations with impaired child growth. G. lamblia infects millions of people worldwide annually and is more prevalent in children residing in low- and middle-income countries, making it an important target for prevention and control efforts. Although G. lamblia carriage is widespread, its epidemiology, natural history, genetic diversity, host genetic susceptibility factors, and post-infectious sequelae in children are still under investigation. As no human vaccine is available, understanding its risk factors in an endemic country is the first step for reducing the burden and mitigating its sequelae. In a birth cohort in Le√≥n, Nicaragua, we found that children living in households with poor sanitation conditions are at higher risk of AGE with G. lamblia detection (GAGE), but prolonged duration of breastfeeding despite these conditions may reduce the risk in these children. The study highlights the importance of breastfeeding and the need to better understand how G. lamblia contributes to the global burden of disease in children, and the mechanisms of host protection to guide future interventions.
