    "Abstract": "Chagas disease (CD), a neglected tropical disease, is caused by infection by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. One-third of CD patients develop cardiac disease (CARD), an inflammatory and fibrotic process that may progress to heart failure associated with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The determinants of CD progression are still uncertain. In non-infectious conditions, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) functional insertion (I)/deletion (D) and type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1R) +1166A>C gene polymorphisms have been linked to clinical outcomes. In a Brazilian cohort of 402 patients with positive serology for CD, in a case-control study we used PCR for genotyping the ACE rs4646994 I/D and AGTR1 rs5182C>T, rs275653 -119C>T, rs2131127A>G and rs5186 +1166A>C polymorphisms to evaluate association with CARD and progression to heart failure. Patients were classified as non-CARD (stage A; 109), and mild (stage B1; 161) or severe (stage C; 132) CARD. The groups were compared using unconditional logistic regression analysis and adjusted for non-genetic covariates (age, gender, and trypanocidal treatment). ACE II genotype appeared less frequent in C patients (15% in C vs 20% in B1 and 27% in A). After covariate adjustments, the ACE D allele showed a borderline association with susceptibility to severe CARD (C vs A: OR = 1.9; P = 0.08). AGTR1 +1166AC genotype showed a borderline association with protection against the progression and severity of CARD (C vs A: OR = 0.6; P = 0.09; C vs B1: OR = 0.6; P = 0.07; C vs A + B1: OR = 0.6; P = 0.05). However, adjustments for multiple comparisons showed no association of ACE I/D and AGTR1 polymorphisms with susceptibility and severity of CARD. The rs275653/rs2131127/rs5186/rs5182 T/A/C/T haplotype was protective against progression to the severe form of CARD (C vs B1: OR = 0.3; P = 0.03). Moreover, patients with ACE II and AGTR1 rs5186 +1166AC genotypes presented higher LVEF%. In C patients, TNF serum levels were higher in ACE D carriers than in II genotype. Although limited in number, a cross-sectional observation suggests that C-stage patients treated with benznidazole years prior to administration of ACE inhibitors/AT1R antagonists show reduced TNF serum levels and improved LVEF%. Therefore, variants of ACE and AGTR1 genes may influence the outcome of Chagas\u2019 heart disease and should be explored in precision medicine. Further, pharmacotherapies may improve immunological abnormality and clinical outcome in CD patients. Altogether, these data support prospective studies of this cohort and replication in other cohorts."
