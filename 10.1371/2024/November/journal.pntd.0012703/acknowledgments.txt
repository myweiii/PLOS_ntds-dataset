The authors would like to thank all the patients who voluntarily participated in the study, all the staff of the House of Chagas (Casa de Chagas), and the Association of Chagas disease patients of Pernambuco for their collaboration during the patient´s recruitment and clinical evaluation. We also acknowledged the invaluable contribution of the nurse Valdinete Paiva (in memoriam) during recruitment, clinical evaluation, and patient care. We want to register our deep sadness for the precocious loss of our colleague and friend Milton Ozório Moraes, who has worked with us to design this study, advise our students, analyze data, and contribute to the first draft of our MS. Our gratitude will be eternal. The authors thank the Multi-user Research Facility of Flow Cytometry and Multiparametric Analysis and the Real-Time PCR Facility (RPT09A), Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
