Trachoma is a disease of the eye and a leading infectious cause of blindness in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by a bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis. It is transmitted by directly or indirectly transferring of eye and nose discharges from people who already have the disease mostly by flies.
The disease in controlled by among other things provision of drugs to communities where the disease is endemic through mass drug administration (MDA). For the MDA to be effective, more than 80% of the community members should be reached. In areas where communities record very low access to MDA, there is need to identify barriers and develop strategies to mitigate the same. In this study we describe community-based participatory approaches employed to develop and test implementation strategies aimed at increasing access to trachoma MDA in Loyamorok ward of Baringo county. The results showed an increase in community participation in the subsequent MDA, which could be attributed to the implemented strategies.
