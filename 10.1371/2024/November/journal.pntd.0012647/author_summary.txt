As most sub-Saharan African cities, Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire has faced recently a considerable increase in the outbreaks of dengue (DEN) and yellow fever (YF). However, critical data are still lacking on the ecology of the main vector Aedes aegypti and the risk of transmission of DEN and YF viruses. We assessed the ecology of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and the risk of DEN and YF virus transmission in areas with high and low DEN and YF occurrences in Abidjan. Our findings revealed a significant presence of Ae. aegypti, indicating a high risk of YF and DEN transmission across all study areas. Ae. aegypti larvae were mostly breeding in tires, discarded containers and water storage containers. Meanwhile, elderly adult females were abundant, alongside a significant presence of both unfed host-seeking and blood-fed individuals in and around residences. We observed seasonal risk patterns, with permanent and high threats for DEN observed throughout both rainy and dry seasons over the entire year, alongside elevated risks of YF during both short and long rainy seasons across all study areas. Our findings provide insights into the ecology of Ae. aegypti and the epidemiology of DEN and YF, crucial for strategically targeting and controlling this vector in areas both affected and unaffected by the disease outbreaks. Community-based intervention programs for managing identified larval breeding sites might reduce Ae. aegypti numbers to prevent future outbreaks of DEN and YF in Abidjan and other sub-Saharan African cities.
