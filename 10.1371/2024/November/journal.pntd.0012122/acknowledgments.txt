We wish to express our appreciation to the staff of the Skukuza State Veterinary Services for their critical and invaluable support during the experimental component of the research. We also extend our appreciation to the SANParks and all the rangers without whom the passive surveillance system would not work. We also would like to thank Dr Silke Klee of the Robert Koch Institute for the Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis DNA used as a control in this study. We also like to appreciate Dean J. Herbig for his assistance in the laboratory during this study. Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.
