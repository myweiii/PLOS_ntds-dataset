Fungal infections, notably sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix spp., pose increasing challenges due to their infectious nature and limited treatment options. These infections are particularly concerning in immunocompromised individuals, resembling Candida albicans in their severity and potential for fatal outcomes. Treatment typically relies on oral antifungals, which are often difficult to administer effectively.
Photodynamic Inactivation (PDI) emerges as a promising approach to enhance antifungal therapy. PDI combines a photosensitizing agent with specific wavelengths of light, generating reactive oxygen species that effectively target and eliminate microbial cells. In this study, we investigated PDI in conjunction with subinhibitory concentrations of curcumin and antifungal drugs (itraconazole, ketoconazole, potassium iodide) against Candida albicans, Sporothrix brasiliensis, and Sporothrix schenckii.
Our results demonstrated that even at curcumin levels below inhibitory thresholds and antifungal concentrations as low as half the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), PDI successfully eradicated these pathogens. This synergistic approach not only highlights PDI’s efficacy as a precursor to antifungal treatment but also suggests potential benefits in reducing drug concentrations and associated side effects.
Overall, this study underscores PDI’s role as a potent adjunct therapy in combatting fungal infections, offering a promising strategy to improve treatment outcomes and manage infections caused by these challenging fungi.
