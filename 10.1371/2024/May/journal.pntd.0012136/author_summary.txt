Tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19, both highly infectious diseases, have posed significant global health challenges, particularly in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) with limited medical resources. Our research highlights that TB-COVID co-infection remains a substantial concern, impacting regions with varying TB burdens. The predominant treatment approach for TB-COVID co-infection has not notably evolved since our earlier study in 2021. It typically involves a combination of the recommended TB regimen and standard COVID-19 treatment. Our analysis consistently shows that individuals with TB-COVID co-infection are at heightened risk of hospitalization, protracted recovery periods, and accelerated mortality compared to those with sole COVID-19 infections. Remarkably, we found limited information on the post-COVID-19 condition of co-infected patients. One study indicated a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms, highlighting the potential psychological toll of TB-COVID co-infection. Although the fatality rate has gradually decreased, it remains notably higher than that of COVID-19 alone. Our findings underscore the urgent need for global collaboration to address the complex challenges posed by TB-COVID co-infection, particularly in countries with limited medical resources.
