Melioidosis is an environmentally acquired infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, with the global distribution of this bacteria is comparatively restricted to temperate zones. The details on epidemiological pattern, demographics, and underlying risk factors of the disease, however, are still scarce. This study examines a 5-year retrospective analysis of 185 confirmed cases that were obtained between 2018 and 2022 from the Negeri Sembilan Melioidosis Registry. In this central region of Peninsular Malaysia, the authors detailed the incidence, death rate, case fatality, correlation with meteorology, and factors influencing mortality. Findings indicated that the state had a 3.1 in 100,000 population yearly mean incidence rate of melioidosis, with a case fatality rate ranging from 8.70% to 16.67%. The incidences vary throughout districts. Nevertheless, no significant relationships were found between monthly humidity and rainfall and the number of cases and fatalities. The main factors found to be associated with a higher mortality rate included bumiputra ethnicities, underlying comorbidities and diabetes mellitus. Remarkably, there was also a correlation found between the mortality status in melioidosis with hypertension. Despite a few limitations, these findings could contribute to improving healthcare professionalsâ€™ knowledge of the illness and for better prevention care.
