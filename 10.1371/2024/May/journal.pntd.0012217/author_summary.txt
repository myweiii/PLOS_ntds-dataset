In our study, we investigated the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and the risk of severe clinical manifestations in cases of dengue fever (DF) and West Nile fever (WNF). By analyzing 27 studies involving over 342,000 laboratory-confirmed patients, we found compelling evidence supporting a link between DM and an increased risk of severe complications in both DF and WNF. Moreover, DM was found to significantly raise the risk of mortality from these diseases.
Our findings emphasize the importance of early detection and appropriate management strategies for diabetic individuals residing in endemic areas. Healthcare providers should be vigilant in monitoring diabetic patients with febrile symptoms, as they are more susceptible to developing severe disease. Tailored care and targeted interventions are crucial to minimize the morbidity and mortality rates associated with DF and WNF in diabetic individuals.
These findings have significant implications for public health, highlighting the need for awareness campaigns and preventive measures aimed at diabetic individuals. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop effective strategies for prevention and treatment. By addressing these issues, we can reduce the impact of DF and WNF on individuals with DM.
