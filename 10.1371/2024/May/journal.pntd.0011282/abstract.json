    "Background": "Chronic carriage of intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) can induce chronic inflammation and dysbiosis, which are risk factors for non-communicable diseases. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between IPI carriage and inflammation in a population of volunteers living in Gabon.",
    "Methodology and principal findings": "A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2020 to November 2021 in asymptomatic volunteers aged 18 years old and over, residing in different areas of Gabon: Libreville (urban area) and Koula-Moutou and Bitam (rural areas). The detection of IPIs was carried out using four common microscopic techniques. C-reactive protein (CRP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured and levels were compared according to the presence or absence of IPI. Overall, 518 participants were included, 64.5% (n = 334) of whom resided in urban area and 35.5% (n = 184) in rural areas. The median age was 35 years (27; 46). The prevalence of asymptomatic IPIs was 29.9% (n = 155), with a significantly higher frequency in rural areas than in urban area (adjusted OR 6.6 (CI 3.2\u201313.8), p < 0.01). Protozoa were more frequent than soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) in both areas: 81.6% (n = 40) in urban area and 69.8% (n = 74) in rural areas. STHs were predominant in rural areas (48.1% vs 22.4% in urban area. In case of IPI, the median values of CRP (15 (13\u201315) mg/L vs 13.0 (11.1\u201314.9) mg/L) and hsCRP (4.2 (1.4\u201313.0) mg/L vs 2.2(0.4\u20136.1) mg/L) were higher (p<0.01). Elevated hsCRP and CRP were significantly more frequent in parasitized individuals (for hsCRP: 22.6%, n = 35; for CRP: 52.9%, n = 82); in particular among STH carriers (for hsCRP: 65.9%, n = 27, for CRP: 36.6%, n = 15) (p < 0.01).",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This first study showed that asymptomatic IPIs, particularly STH carriage are associated with high CRP and hsCRP levels. Further larger and longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the global and specie-specific enteropathogens link with chronic inflammation."
