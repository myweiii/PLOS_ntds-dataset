Loiasis–also called African eye worm for its most pathognomonic feature–is a disease caused by the helminth Loa loa, affecting over ten million people in Central and West Africa. While L. loa seems to successfully evade an effective immune response in chronic infection, treatment can lead to severe inflammation upon rapid death of L. loa larvae in the blood. Here, we investigated different subsets of immune cells hypothesized to play a role in L. loa-mediated immune modulation in chronically infected individuals and upon treatment of individuals with circulating larvae. We found that eosinophils–an important cell population in the immune response to helminths–increase in numbers and are activated in both L. loa-infection and its treatment. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells can suppress immune responses in cancer and some other infectious diseases but have never been investigated in loiasis. We hypothesized that they are involved in immunosuppression by L. loa but found no evidence thereof. Better understanding of immunomodulation in chronic loiasis may ultimately improve the management of this neglected disease.
