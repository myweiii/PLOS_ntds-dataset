An important feature of macrophages is their ability to adopt many different phenotypes and functions in response to extracellular or intracellular cues. Functionally well-adapted macrophages are required for the defense against T. gondii. Here, we found that Fam96a expressed in macrophages played a role in control of T. gondii infection. Mechanically speaking, Fam96a regulated intracellular iron homeostasis, which affected immune effector molecules. Our study reveals that Fam96a may autonomously act as a critical gatekeeper of intracellular parasitic control by coupling Fe metabolism to adaptative remodeling of macrophage function. It provides a novel target for prevention and treatment of toxoplasmosis and other intracellular pathogens in the future.
