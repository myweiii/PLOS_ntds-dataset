Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a neglected gynaecological disease caused by the waterborne parasite Schistosoma (S.) haematobium. Despite over 45 million women are at risk of FGS in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA), approximately only 15,000 have been screened for the disease. Diagnosis is challenging and has traditionally required high technical expertise based on visual inspection for FGS typical lesions of the genital tract using a standard colposcope, seldom available in endemic settings. Closer-to the-user and decentralized strategies for FGS screening and diagnosis should be implemented to assess disease burden and scale-up FGS surveillance. This study was nested within the larger Morbidity Operational Research for Bilharziasis Implementation Decision (MORBID) cross-sectional project, aiming to correlate schistosomiasis-related morbidity data with village level endemicity across two districts in Southern Malawi. We found a significantly moderate to high burden of FGS (between 8–27% depending on diagnostic method used), with marked age differences in diagnostic performance. Further, some villages with low schistosomiasis prevalence (which would be excluded from control strategies per new WHO guidelines), had a significantly high burden of FGS, indicating the need for formal public health interventions. Within the remit of the sustainable development goals, this study’s approach and findings emphasize the need of a field-deployable strategy to FGS screening and diagnosis in endemic areas in Malawi and other similar setting.
