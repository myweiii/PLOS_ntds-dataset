Tungiasis is one of the most neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It is caused by a flea which burrows into the skin, usually of the feet. The neglect has resulted in large gaps in our knowledge of the disease, how to treat and prevent infection. This is partly due to a lack of appreciation for the impact the disease has on patientsâ€™ lives by health officials, policymakers and the research community. In this study we aimed to determine the impact on school children in nine counties of Kenya. We found evidence that children experience considerable pain and itching which affects their ability to attend school and to concentrate on their classes. They had lower exam scores in mathematics, English and science than uninfected children. This study has provided evidence that tungiasis is a disease that has a considerable impact on children and urgently needs more attention from researchers, donors, and policy makers. Integrating tungiasis into comprehensive disease management for school-aged children will protect their physical and cognitive development and their future prospects.
