Currently, there are over 108 million forcibly displaced people globallyâ€”mainly refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people. Migration is associated with increased exposure to infectious diseases. Zoonotic pathogens transmitted between humans and animals, account for the majority of emerging human diseases. Zoonoses are responsible for a substantial disease burden and are recognised to cause disease outbreaks, particularly in vulnerable populations in crowded living conditions. Unfortunately, zoonoses are often neglected by both healthcare services, medical research and especially in the context of migration. This review focussed on the current research of a spectrum of clinically relevant zoonotic pathogens in displaced populations to identify gaps in literature and inform on future research.
Our findings highlighted the following gaps; zoonotic viruses appear particularly neglected, despite them being most commonly associated with disease outbreaks. The majority of publications investigating zoonoses in displaced people focused on three pathogens: Schistosoma species, Giardia lamblia and Leishmania species. There were very few publications investigating zoonotic pathogens in asylum seekers and internally displaced people compared to refugees. Future studies should be more inclusive and incorporate One Health approaches to adequately investigate the impact of zoonoses on displaced populations, and to identify transmission pathways for designing improved interventions.
