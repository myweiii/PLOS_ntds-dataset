We thank the contribution of patients and trial team members at the recruitment site who contributed to data collection and data entry and members of the data monitoring and ethics committee: Ewen M Harrison, Sarah Brown, Krishna Prasad Dhakal and Namita Ghimire. We also thank the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit and the trial steering committee for its advice and support during the study: Gemma Slinn, Premal Das, Kara Hanson, Paul Saunderson, Magdalena Skrybant and our community engagement contributors from IDEA Nepal that were also members of the Trial Steering Committee, Amar Timilsina and Dinesh Basnet. We want to thank Bahadir Celiktemur and Tom Lingard, who performed blinded assessments of all photographs of ulcers. We thank Paul Saunderson for pointing out the risk, albeit likely small of performance bias that led us to the idea of movement monitoring. We want to express our cordial thanks to the whole clinical team at Anandaban Hospital, especially Mr Ram Kumar Maharjan, Mrs Dipawali Rana, Mrs Sabina Shrestha, Mrs Laxmi Tamang and Kashi Nath Aryal. We appreciate their dedication in the treatment of patients during the trial, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
