Chagas disease results from infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is a major public health problem throughout Latin America. T. cruzi is a genetically diverse species and infection can result in a wide range of pathological outcomes, mainly associated with the heart and/or digestive tract. Research on Chagas disease, ranging from fundamental biology to drug development, has been greatly aided by the availability of genetically modified parasite reporter strains that express bioluminescent:fluorescent fusion proteins. In combination with mouse models and imaging technology, these strains allow infections to be monitored in real-time, with high sensitivity, and infection foci to be visualised at single-cell resolution. Here, we describe an extensive panel of bioluminescent and fluorescent strains that cover the diversity of the T. cruzi species. These reporter strains, that are available on request, should have wide utility in many areas of Chagas disease research. In particular, as part of the drug development screening programme, they can be used to ensure that candidate compounds have in vivo activity across the species prior to being advanced into clinical testing.
