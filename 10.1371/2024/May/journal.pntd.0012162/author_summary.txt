West Nile virus (WNV) is a virus that is transmitted by mosquitoes, and that leads to West Nile fever cases in humans and horses. Although the virus has been in certain parts of Europe since the 1960s, it has recently spread northward, with the first human cases reported in Germany in 2018 and the Netherlands in 2020. Here, we use mathematical modelling to understand the conditions necessary for WNV transmission. We consider the proportion of mosquito bites on birds that can carry the virus, the number of hosts and vectors, the length of mosquito season, and temperature data in specific European regions where WNV has been observed previously (Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Greece). We found that the number of days suitable for WNV transmission (determined by the basic reproduction number, R0) has increased over the last 40 years in all these regions. Furthermore, we found differences among these regions. In the Netherlands, for instance, the conditions for virus circulation requires higher vector-host ratios, while in warmer regions like Greece, Spain, and Italy, circulation occurs under lower ratios. Understanding the connection between temperature, mosquito traits, and WNV transmission is crucial for implementing surveillance and preventive measures.
