Loiasis is a filarial disease highly prevalent in parts of Western- and Central Africa. For a long time, the disease has been considered to be a relatively benign condition, but recent studies have shown that loiasis causes significant morbidity and excess mortality. In the present study, we investigated the perception of loiasis in a highly affected community in rural Gabon to better understand the community perspective on this infectious disease. While L. loa as a disease is known to most inhabitants, the mode of transmission and prevention modalities are only poorly understood. This lack of knowledge leaves the communities with inadequate means to prevent onward transmission of this filarial disease. The contribution from media, schools and healthcare institutions in providing information about loiasis is inadequate, and the available healthcare system is insufficient to provide the necessary care for loiasis. A better understanding of loiasis by the affected communities is desirable to empower inhabitants of high-transmission regions to better protect themselves from loiasis. Improved understanding of the disease by the healthcare sector is necessary to improve the management of loiasis.
