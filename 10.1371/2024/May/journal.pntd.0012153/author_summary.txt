Toxoplasmosis infection is globally prevalent but can cause severe negative neonatal health outcomes when acquired congenitally. Transmission from mother to neonate depends upon a mother’s first-time infection and the stage of pregnancy when mother is infected. The causative agent of toxoplasmosis is a protozoan parasite that contributes to the common difficulties in identifying a mother’s primary acute infection. Commonly, serologic testing is administered to identify antibodies to the infection, along with avidity testing that helps to determine current versus past infection. Digital PCR is a next-generation molecular tool that can identify very small quantities of pathogens. This tool was utilized in addition to typical serology plus avidity testing to identify suspected primary T. gondii infections in banked blood and serum samples from Salvadoran women at the time of labor and delivery. Health outcomes surveys were also utilized from the original study to determine associations between recent T. gondii infections during pregnancy and maternal-neonatal pregnancy and birth outcomes. We identified 13 women with evidence of recent T. gondii infection during pregnancy, 11 of which were identified through dPCR. Maternal infection was associated with negative maternal outcomes including pregnancy complications, and associations were found between infection and neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome. Maternal infection was also associated with owning pet cats. This study utilized a new molecular tool to aid in identification of T. gondii primary infection, a neglected disease that is historically difficult to identify through traditional methods. Digital PCR could be useful for toxoplasmosis testing in future studies and clinical settings.
