In this study, we investigated specific epidemiological patterns related to the Icterohaemorrhagiae and Cynopteri serogroups in urban environments at high risk for leptospirosis. Our results indicate that seropositivity for the Cynopteri serogroup increases with age. Seropositivity is also higher in places where houses have unplastered walls and where there are cats in the vicinity of the residences. Seropositivity for the Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup also increases with age, and is more prevalent in men and in individuals exposed to work or who have contact with sewage. Spatial analysis reveals variations in the distribution of seropositivity for these serogroups within the five urban areas studied. We emphasize the importance of evaluating the epidemiological pattern for the different Leptospira serogroups, since each serogroup may be associated with different animal reservoirs. Our data suggest that the Icterohaemorrhagiae and Cynopteri serogroups present different epidemiological pattern, thus highlighting the need to understand the complex interactions between serogroups and reservoirs. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology of leptospirosis, but also have practical public health implications by helping to identify risk factors and thereby develop more effective preventive measures.
