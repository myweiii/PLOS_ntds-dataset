Parenteral administration of antivenoms is the core of the current treatment of snakebite envenomations, and there is an urgent need to produce antivenoms of wide neutralizing efficacy for sub-Saharan Africa. The active substance of antivenoms are antibodies (or antibody fragments) purified from plasma of horses or sheep immunized by the repeated injection of snake venoms. Generally, these antibodies can neutralize the venoms used as immunogens and other related venoms. Normally, the venoms used as immunogens are selected considering their medical importance and availability. To complement these criteria with information regarding the immunogenicity of venoms, we compared monospecific, bispecific/monogeneric, and polyspecific/monogeneric antisera towards venoms of Bitis spp., Echis spp., Dendroaspis spp., spitting Naja spp. or non-spitting Naja spp, regarding their intrageneric neutralization scope, evaluated by the lethality neutralization assay in mice. We found that the polyspecific antisera against venoms of Bitis spp, Echis spp, Dendroaspis spp, or non-spitting Naja gave the best neutralization profile. On the other hand, the monospecific, bispecific and polyspecific antisera towards venoms of spitting Naja venoms showed a similar performance. This information suggests that polyspecific immunogens could be the best alternative to produce antivenoms with the widest neutralizing coverage against sub-Saharan African snake venoms.
