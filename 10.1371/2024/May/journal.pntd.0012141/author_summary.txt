Tularemia is a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by Francisella tularensis. This bacterium can infect animals (domestic and wild vertebrates), invertebrates, and humans. Francisella tularensis is transferred to humans through contact with infected wild animals (, inhalation of infected aerosols, arthropod bites, consumption of contaminated water or contaminated food, and swimming and contact in polluted hydro-telluric environments. The mortality rate associated with this disease ranges from 2 to 60% in the absence of proper antibiotic treatment. The prevalence of F. tularensis varies significantly between countries, as these pathogens can infect a wide range of hosts and have multiple vectors. However, there needs to be complete data on the geographical distribution of different species of F. tularensis, as well as the status of reservoirs, vectors, and human cases in most parts of the world. Therefore, this study aimed to determine F. tularensis prevalence in the countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMRO). Based on our study, the human seroprevalence of tularemia in WHO-EMRO countries was 6.2%. The pooled prevalence of F. tularensis in environmental samples (water and soil), ticks, rodents, and domestic ruminants were 5.8%, 2.5%, 2.0%, and 0.6% in the WHO-EMRO countries, respectively.
