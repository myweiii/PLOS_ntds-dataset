Toxoplasmosis is a major health burden for developed and developing countries, causing damage to eyes and brain, loss of life and substantial societal costs. Prompt diagnosis in gestational screening programs enables treatment, thereby relieving suffering, and leading to > 14-fold cost savings for care. Herein, we demonstrate that using an ICT that meets WHO REASSURED-criteria identifying persons with/without antibody to Toxoplasma gondii in sera and whole blood with high sensitivity and specificity, is feasible to use in USA clinical practice. We find this new approach can help to obviate the problem of detection of false positive anti-T. gondii IgM results for those without IgG antibodies to T. gondii when this occurs in present, standard of care, predicate USA FDA cleared available assays. Thus, this accurate test facilitates gestational screening programs and a global initiative to diagnose and thereby prevent and treat T. gondii infection. This minimizes likelihood of false positives (IgG and/or IgM) while maintaining maximum sensitivity. When isolated IgM antibodies are detected, it is necessary to confirm and when indicated continue follow up testing in ~2 weeks to establish seroconversion. Presence of a positive ICT makes it likely that IgM is truly positive and a negative ICT makes it likely that IgM will be a false positive without infection. These results create a new, enthusiastically-accepted, precise paradigm for rapid diagnosis and validation of results with a second-line test. This helps eliminate alarm and anxiety about false-positive results, while expediting needed treatment for true positive results and providing back up distinguishing false positive tests.
