    "Background": "Yellow fever (YF), a mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic fever, is endemic in Uganda and causes frequent outbreaks. A total of 1.6 million people were vaccinated during emergency mass immunization campaigns in 2011 and 2016. This study explored local perceptions of YF emergency mass immunization among vulnerable groups to inform future vaccination campaigns.",
    "Methodology": "In this qualitative study, we conducted 43 semi-structured interviews, 4 focus group discussions, and 10 expert interviews with 76 participants. Data were collected in six affected districts with emergency mass vaccination. We included vulnerable groups (people \u2265 65 years and pregnant women) who are typically excluded from YF vaccination except during mass immunization. Data analysis was conducted using grounded theory. Inductive coding was utilized, progressing through open, axial, and selective coding.",
    "Principal findings": "Participants relied on community sources for information about the YF mass vaccination. Information was disseminated door-to-door, in community spaces, during religious gatherings, and on the radio. However, most respondents had no knowledge of the vaccine, and it was unclear to them whether a booster dose was required. In addition, the simultaneous presidential election during the mass vaccination campaign led to suspicion and resistance to vaccination. The lack of reliable and trustworthy information and the politicization of vaccination campaigns reinforced mistrust of YF vaccines.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "People in remote areas affected by YF outbreaks rely on community sources of information. We therefore recommend improving health education, communication, and engagement through respected and trusted community members. Vaccination campaigns can never be seen as detached from political systems and power relations."
