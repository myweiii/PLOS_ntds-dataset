Yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical regions of South America and Africa. It can cause severe illness and death. Yellow fever can be prevented with a vaccine. However, people in several affected regions are not vaccinated because the vaccine is expensive and not part of routine immunization. For them, access to the vaccine is only possible during emergency mass vaccination campaigns when an outbreak occurs. In this study, we explored local perceptions of emergency yellow fever mass vaccination among vulnerable groups (people over 65 years and pregnant women) in Uganda to understand better how these people have access to vaccine information, what information reaches affected communities, what motivates people to be vaccinated, and what political motives may influence vaccination programs. Despite extensive campaigns, we found that the information reaching communities varied widely, with people relying heavily on community sources. In addition, the lack of trustworthy information and the politicization of vaccination campaigns increased mistrust of yellow fever vaccines. We also found that informed consent is only possible if the principle of vaccination—protection from disease—is understood. Awareness campaigns should focus on a broad understanding of the importance of immunization. Those involved in organizing campaigns should be aware of the potential impact of politicization on vaccine uptake.
