The relevance of drug susceptibility of clinical strains of Leishmania measured in culture to the outcome of treatment is uncertain. We evaluated the relation between susceptibility of Leishmania isolated from cutaneous leishmaniasis patients to the widely used anti-leishmanial drug, meglumine antimoniate, and the outcome of treatment of the corresponding patients. We considered patient factors associated with treatment failure, such as age, adherence to treatment and concurrent medical conditions, in determining whether drug resistance among parasites isolated from these patients was linked to treatment failure. We found that drug-resistant Leishmania predominantly belong to a widely prevalent subpopulation that is biochemically distinguishable and more pathogenic in mice; and, that treatment failure was significantly more frequent (63%) among patients infected with these Sb-resistant Leishmania than patients infected with drug sensitive parasites (30%). Furthermore, tolerance/resistance to antimony was significantly higher among strains isolated from patients who failed treatment than those cured following treatment. The relationship between drug resistance and treatment failure was not perceived when only patients having the defined risk factors for failure were evaluated separately, evidencing the confounding effect of host factors and the importance of considering these when assessing the relevance of parasite drug resistance in the response to treatment.
