Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe infectious disease caused by unicellular parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex. As VL is fatal when left untreated, early and confirmatory laboratory diagnosis is crucial for adequate patient management. However, currently available serological assays, such as the rK39 rapid diagnostic test, fall short in terms of sensitivity and cannot be used for detection of relapsing infections. Therefore, we evaluated an innovative and user-friendly diagnostic assay called mini-dbPCR-NALFIA, which is based on the direct detection of Leishmania kinetoplast DNA in human blood samples. We found that mini-dbPCR-NALFIA can detect down to 500 parasites per millilitre of blood, which is lower than the parasite loads generally seen in untreated VL patients. Furthermore, we assessed the accuracy of mini-dbPCR-NALFIA using a set of Spanish and East-African samples from VL patients and control groups. In the Spanish samples, sensitivity of mini-dbPCR-NALFIA was very high and somewhat better than in the East-African samples. The specificity of mini-dbPCR-NALFIA was excellent in both sample sets. In conclusion, considering its robust performance and simplicity, the mini-dbPCR-NALFIA is a promising diagnostic assay that has the potential to improve VL diagnosis and follow-up of treated patients, especially in resource-limited situations.
