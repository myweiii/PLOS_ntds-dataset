Leishmania parasites of the subgenus Mundinia are an emerging health and veterinary problem that should not be ignored. Being the most recent of all Leishmania described, many aspects of Mundinia biology are enigmatic. We have very scarce data on their life cycles and biology, thus proper laboratory research must be done to enable their better understanding. One of the most crucial parts of the life cycle of Leishmania is the development in the mammalian host. In the past, we worked on establishment of other laboratory models for the subgenus, but neither Arvicanthis, Mastomys, nor guinea pigs proved to be a good choice. Other authors performed experiments with BALB/c mice using various inoculation techniques, but they also failed. Here we describe the establishment of two new potential laboratory model species, Chinese hamsters and steppe lemmings, which proved to be susceptible to Mundinia and such findings will enable other scientists to continue in research of these parasites.
