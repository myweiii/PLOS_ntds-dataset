Rodents are the important hosts of many pathogens, especially vector-borne pathogens, and can harbor and transmit them to humans and cause diseases. In China, little information is known about the infection of vector-borne pathogens in rodents although the rodent species are very diverse. In this study, seven wild rodent species were collected to identify the genetic diversity of vector-borne bacteria and protozoan. Interestingly, diverse vector-borne microorganisms, including four Anaplasma, five Ehrlichia, “Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis”, six Bartonella, Babesia microti and diverse Hepatozoon were identified in six rodent species. Furthermore, two potential novel Bartonella species were detected. All these data suggested great genetic diversity of vector-borne pathogens infections in rodents. Of them, six species (including two Anaplasma, two Bartonella, “Ca. N. mikurensis” and Bab. microti) are pathogenic to humans except A. bovis and A. ovis with zoonotic potential, suggesting significant risks to local human population.
