The parasitic protozoan Leishmania amazonensis is the etiological agent responsible for cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. The latter is characterized by nodular lesions that spread over the body of the infected individual and is associated with a CD4/Th2 type immune response to the infection. Treatment failure is commonly reported for this clinical form of disease. Here, we characterized a L. amazonensis clinical isolate obtained from a patient with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis coinfected with HIV who had undergone unsuccessful therapeutic regimens with meglumine antimoniate, liposomal amphotericin B, and pentamidine. To evaluate whether the treatment failure was due to drug resistance in this clinical isolate, in vitro susceptibility assays were performed with the antileishmanial drugs currently available, followed by an investigation of treatment response in mice. In vivo studies demonstrated that mice infected with this clinical isolate did not respond to treatment with amphotericin B, but did respond to treatment with miltefosine, paromomycin, and a combination of both drugs, confirming an amphotericin B resistance phenotype of the isolate that was also observed in vitro.
