This communication reports on 420 patients with extrapedal mycetoma seen at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Khartoum, Sudan, from January 1991 to December 2021. Males were predominantly affected. Their ages ranged between 1.5 and 95 years; most were students and farmers. The majority of patients were from El Gezira, North Kordofan and White Nile States. Family history of mycetoma was recorded in only a few. The buttock was affected most, followed by the head, neck, back, chest, and abdominal wall. The prominent clinical presentation findings were massive lesions with multiple sinuses discharging grains and lymphadenopathy. Eumycetoma was the most encountered type. The treatment outcome was unsatisfactory, characterised by a low cure rate and high recurrence and follow-up dropout rates. This emphasises the importance of early case detection and management, health education programmes, and patient counselling to encourage them to seek treatment early and reduce poor treatment outcomes and dropouts.
