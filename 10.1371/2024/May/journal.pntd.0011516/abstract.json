    "Background": "Sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense is a fatal disease and endemic in Southern and Eastern Africa. There is an urgent need to develop novel diagnostic and control tools to achieve elimination of rhodesiense sleeping sickness which might be achieved through a better understanding of trypanosome gene expression and genetics using endemic isolates. Here, we describe transcriptome profiles and population structure of endemic T. b. rhodesiense isolates in human blood in Malawi.",
    "Methodology": "Blood samples of r-HAT cases from Nkhotakota and Rumphi foci were collected in PaxGene tubes for RNA extraction before initiation of r-HAT treatment. 100 million reads were obtained per sample, reads were initially mapped to the human genome reference GRCh38 using HiSat2 and then the unmapped reads were mapped against Trypanosoma brucei reference transcriptome (TriTrypDB54_TbruceiTREU927) using HiSat2. Differential gene expression analysis was done using the DeSeq2 package in R. SNP calling from reads that were mapped to the T. brucei genome was done using GATK in order to identify T.b. rhodesiense population structure.",
    "Results": "24 samples were collected from r-HAT cases of which 8 were from Rumphi and 16 from Nkhotakota foci. The isolates from Nkhotakota were enriched with transcripts for cell cycle arrest and stumpy form markers, whereas isolates in Rumphi focus were enriched with transcripts for folate biosynthesis and antigenic variation pathways. These parasite focus-specific transcriptome profiles are consistent with the more virulent disease observed in Rumphi and a less symptomatic disease in Nkhotakota associated with the non-dividing stumpy form. Interestingly, the Malawi T.b. rhodesiense isolates expressed genes enriched for reduced cell proliferation compared to the Uganda T.b. rhodesiense isolates. PCA analysis using SNPs called from the RNAseq data showed that T. b. rhodesiense parasites from Nkhotakota are genetically distinct from those collected in Rumphi.",
    "Conclusion": "Our results suggest that the differences in disease presentation in the two foci is mainly driven by genetic differences in the parasites in the two major endemic foci of Rumphi and Nkhotakota rather than differences in the environment or host response."
