A better understanding of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense gene expression profiles and population structure using endemic isolate may speed up the search for novel diagnostic and control tools for rhodesiense sleeping sickness. Here, we analysed T. b. rhodesiense transcriptome profiles from endemic isolated from peripheral blood in Nkhotakota and Rumphi foci in Malawi. In Nkhotakota focus, T. b. rhodesiense transcripts were enriched for cell cycle arrest and stumpy marker whereas in Rumphi focus, the isolates were enriched for antigenic variation and folate biosynthesis biological pathways. Furthermore, we also found that T. b. rhodesiense population structure in Nkhotakota focus is different from Rumphi focus. The differences in trypanosome gene expression profiles and population structure are consistent with a less severe and acute sleeping sickness clinical profiles in Nkhotakota and Rumphi foci respectively and suggest that the differences in pathology in the two foci are mainly due to differences in the parasite rather than in the host response.
