    "Background": "Cryptosporidium spp. cause watery diarrhea in humans and animals, especially in infants and neonates. They parasitize the apical surface of the epithelial cells in the intestinal lumen. However, the pathogenesis of Cryptosporidium-induced diarrhea is not fully understood yet.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "In this study, we infected C57BL/6j neonatal mice with C. parvum IIa and IId subtypes, and examined oocyst burden, pathological changes, and intestinal epithelial permeability during the infection. In addition, transcriptomic analyses were used to study the mechanism of diarrhea induced by the C. parvum IId subtype. The neonatal mice were sensitive to both C. parvum IIa and IId infection, but the IId subtype caused a wide oocyst shedding window and maintained the high oocyst burden in the mice compared with the IIa subtype. In addition, the mice infected with C. parvum IId resulted in severe intestinal damage at the peak of infection, leading to increased permeability of the epithelial barrier. The KEGG, GO and GSEA analyses revealed that the downregulation of adherens junction and cell junction molecules at 11 dpi. Meanwhile, E-cadherin, which is associated with adherens junction, was reduced at the protein level in mouse ileum at peak and late infection.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "C. parvum IId infection causes more severe pathological damage than C. parvum IIa infection in neonatal mice. Furthermore, the impairment of the epithelial barrier during C. parvum IId infection results from the downregulation of intestinal junction proteins."
