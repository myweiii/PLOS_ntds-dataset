Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection in humans can cause brain inflammation, and there is currently no effective diagnostic method to clarify the pathological changes in the brain. Current diagnostic methods include CSF detection and eosinophilia immune examination after lumbar puncture, but these protocols are risky and may produce false-positive responses. Non-invasive medical imaging techniques might allow for the circumvention of these problems. The effective use of 18F-FDG PET imaging as a diagnostic tool for parasitic infections has been reported. In this study, we hypothesize that the A. cantonensis infection-induced inflammatory and immunomodulatory factors of eosinophils have an impact on the localized pathological changes in the brains of non-permissive hosts. These changes can be analyzed using live in vivo 18F -FDG PET medical imaging. A. Cantonensis was infected in non-permissive ICR mice and permissive SD rats, after which the effects of the resulting inflammation on energy metabolism were characterized via nuclear medicine imaging. We also quantitatively measured the distributed uptake values of different brain regions, to build an evaluated imaging model of localized neuropathological damages caused by eosinophil-inflammation. Through the completion of this study, we intend to develop a specific radiological medical imaging analysis model of angiostrongyliasis for important endemic zoonotic parasitic diseases. We are trying to develop a cross-disciplinary research project combining parasitology and nuclear medicine and to establish an imaging model for analyzing angiostrongyliasis that can be applied to clinical evaluation and prognosis.
