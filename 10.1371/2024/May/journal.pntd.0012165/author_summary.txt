Female sand flies salivate during feeding on vertebrate blood and natural sugars. During salivation, they may release microorganisms associated with the salivary glands and digestive tract, i.e. viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens, into the feeding substrates. However, the type and the number of bacteria egested during salivation is unclear. Here, by sing the forced salivation experiment and targeting the 16S rRNA barcode gene, egested bacteria were characterized in sand flies. Culture-dependent and culture-independent methods identified the members of Enterobacter cloacae and Spiroplasma species as dominant taxa, respectively. The abundance of microbes in the saliva of each P. papatasi sand fly was determined to be around 9,000 bacterial cells. The lack of a vaccine and the failure of treatment in leishmaniasis provide many motivations to better understand the factors cause the inflammatory response. The findings of this study can improve our insight into measuring the effect of vector-derived bacteria on the improvement or deterioration of leishmaniasis.
