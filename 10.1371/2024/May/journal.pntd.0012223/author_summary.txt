Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis, affecting cattle of all ages. Mycobacterium bovis imposes significant economic burdens on livestock farmers, primarily through reduced production, trade restrictions for live animals and animal products, and the costs of control measures. The disease can be transmitted to humans via consumption of raw milk or through inhalation of infected aerosols. Worldwide, the bovine tuberculosis accounts for 10% of the human tuberculosis cases. In Bhutan, the prevalence and incidence of bTB in both cattle and humans are unknown. In this study, we estimated the seroprevalence of bTB among cattle in six eastern districts of Bhutan. We collected serum samples from 971 cattle and tested them for bovine tuberculosis using ELISA. Our study demonstrated an apparent prevalence of 2.57% (95% CI:1.58–3.57) and a true prevalence of 0.91% (95% CI: 0.0–2.81). Additionally, we assessed factors such as age, breed and farm location that could affect the prevalence of bTB, but none of these factors were significantly associated with the prevalence of bTB. Our study revealed a very low seroprevalence of bTB, among cattle in eastern Bhutan. The findings from this study will contribute to design prevention and control measures for bTB in cattle in Bhutan.
