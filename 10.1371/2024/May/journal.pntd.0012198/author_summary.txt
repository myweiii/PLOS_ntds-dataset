Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite that infects both humans and animals. T. gondii infection during pregnancy causes congenital transmission and serious fetal and neonatal complications. Estimating the pooled prevalence of toxoplasmosis in high-risk population groups could catch the attention of policymakers and prompt them to develop a policy brief and guidelines to reduce toxoplasmosis sequelae. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to assess the pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection and its determinants among pregnant women in Africa. All articles reporting recent data on the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis among pregnant women in African countries were systematically searched using various databases. Sixty articles published from 2010 to 2023 were included for analysis, representing a total of 29,383 pregnant women. The pooled prevalence of toxoplasmosis was 42.89% (95%CI: 36.75â€“49.03). Cat ownership and the consumption of raw meat and raw vegetables had a statistically significant effect on the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis among pregnant women in Africa. The infection is more prevalent in countries of Central and East Africa. These findings should increase the awareness of health workers and their understanding of toxoplasmosis among pregnant women and motivate them to conduct integrated community awareness creation activities concerning the risk factors for toxoplasmosis.
