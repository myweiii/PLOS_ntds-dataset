Echinococcosis is a natural focal, highly prevalent disease in China. Factors influencing the spread of echinococcosis are not only related to personal exposure but also closely related to the environment itself. This study covered all endemic counties in China and studied the main environmental factors affecting the epidemic of echinococcosis. to explore the influence of environmental factors on the prevalence of human echinococcosis, and to provide a reference for prevention and control of echinococcosis in the future. Data were collected from 370 endemic counties in China in 2018. By downloading Modis, DEM and other remote-sensing images in 2018. The prevalence of human echinococcosis in each county was positively correlated with elevation, negatively correlated with LST, and negatively correlated with NDVI in May, June and July. Prevalence of human echinococcosis was negatively correlated with annual LST and summer NDVI, and positively correlated with average elevation and dog infection rate. Prevalence of human cystic echinococcosis was inversely correlated with the annual average LST, and positively correlated with both the average elevation and the prevalence rate of domestic animals. The prevalence of human alveolar echinococcosis was positively correlated with both NDVI in autumn and average elevation, and negatively correlated with NDVI in winter.
