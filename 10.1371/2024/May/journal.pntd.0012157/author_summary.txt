Location-specific weather factors influence the fate, transport, and transmission of enteropathogens that cause diarrhea. We sought to identify hydrometeorological risk factors associated with childhood diarrhea and specific enteropathogens in rural Bangladesh. In this setting, higher temperatures and precipitation were associated with higher diarrhea in children under 5 years old and with several enteropathogens including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Higher precipitation was associated with the lower prevalence of some enteric viruses. Our data suggest that interventions targeted to reduce pathogen transmission just before and during the rainy season might be most effective to reduce diarrhea in this setting.
