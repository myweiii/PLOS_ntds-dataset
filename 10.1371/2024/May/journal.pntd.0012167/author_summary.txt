Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of three historic plague pandemics. Presently, the plague remains endemic or sporadic in many countries. The wide distribution of natural plague foci in Asia, Africa, and the Americas reminds us of the threat of a plague outbreak. The timely detection and surveillance of Y. pestis prevalence in animals and the environment in natural epidemic foci is essential for preventing and controlling plague outbreaks. In this study, we developed a sensitive and specific ddPCR assay for detecting low concentrations of Y. pestis DNA from soil and mouse tissue samples. The ddPCR assay presented a considerable improvement in sensitivity compared to the qPCR assay used in the study, thus providing a promising tool for detecting Y. pestis DNA from complex samples and facilitating the accurate diagnosis of plague cases.
