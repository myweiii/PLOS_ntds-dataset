Chikungunya disease is an emerging public health concern. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes and characterized by arthralgia and fever in the acute phase, lasting 7â€“10 days. Additionally, some individuals experience chronic symptoms such as arthralgia and tiredness that can last from months to years. Chikungunya is mainly present in the Americas and Asian countries, but the mosquitoes transmitting the disease are spreading to other regions due to climate change, amongst others. This increased disease threat highlights the importance of understanding chikungunya symptoms. However, there are currently no precise estimates on the prevalence of chikungunya symptoms. Therefore, we analysed the available literature on the clinical manifestations of chikungunya. We found that 75% of infected people develop symptoms, primarily characterized by arthralgia in 90% and fever in 88% of cases. Chronic symptoms affect 44% of symptomatic people, and 0.3% of patients with chikungunya die. Unfortunately, we were not able to estimate all predefined outcomes of interest because we did not find enough studies publishing on some of these, demonstrating that there is still much unknown around the clinical manifestations of chikungunya. However, the results can help healthcare workers early identifying chikungunya and raise awareness of this debilitating disease.
