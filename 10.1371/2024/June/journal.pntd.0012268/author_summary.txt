Dengue virus (DENV) is an RNA virus which causes many infections worldwide. Taiwan experienced the largest DENV-2 outbreak in 2015 which resulted in many fatalities. Specific reasons for the increase in severity during this outbreak remains unclear. The molecular epidemiology of this outbreak showed that clade replacement may have occurred, with the 2015 isolates forming a new clade and the old clade consisted of sequences from 2001â€“2004 in Taiwan. A dominant C-A314G (K73R) substitution was found in the 2015 DENV-2 outbreak isolates, which may have resulted in a clade replacement in the DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype. Further analysis of genetic variation of the virus population of one DENV-2 infected patient showed a decrease of haplotypes during the progression of infection and an NS4A-L115I mutation that did not appear until a later time-point. These show the difference between the variations found in a population wide analysis compared to an infrapopulation analysis which can influence viral infection.
