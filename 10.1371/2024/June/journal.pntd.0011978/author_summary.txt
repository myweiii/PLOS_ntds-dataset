“Prolonged” or “Persistent” Febrile illnesses (PFI) are common challenging diagnostic entities in LMICs. Symptoms and signs can be non-specific and diagnostic tests are often not available, and antibiotics inadequate. This systematic review aimed to investigate important causes of PFI in different geographical regions, as well as to highlight lack of data in these areas to stimulate discussion for future research. We found that zoonotic bacterial and neglected parasitic diseases accounted for substantial proportions of PFI cases, in particular rickettsiosis, borreliosis, brucellosis, leptospirosis, melioidosis, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis and amoebiasis. Although data is very limited for many regions, our results suggest that the geographical context can help inform clinicians on the likelihood of different infections in a patient with PFI.
