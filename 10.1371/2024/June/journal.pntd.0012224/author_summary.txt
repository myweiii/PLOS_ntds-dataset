Yaws is a non-venereal ulcerative disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum ssp. Pertenue. This disease is spread through skin-to-skin contact by someone with an infectious ulcer and is endemic in 13 countries, including Ghana, Cameroon and Ivory Coast. Oral azithromycin is the preferred treatment for yaws and the World Health Organization is currently deploying mass drug administration campaigns of azithromycin with the aim of global eradication of yaws. A cornerstone of this eradication campaign is reaching a population treatment coverage of over 90%, therefore education and awareness of the disease’s natural history and management is paramount. In this study, we aimed to explore knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding yaws in Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire and Cameroon to understand the general understanding of the disease and the practices around it. We found that the route of transmission of yaws is generally not well understood, with most individuals incorrectly reporting sources like dirty drinking or washing water, and supernatural causes such as curses or witchcraft. Most respondents would attend hospitals or clinics if they had yaws for correct management, although traditional healers were also a popular choice. Community health workers reported a correct management of the disease, although low stock of tests and drug availability was reported.
