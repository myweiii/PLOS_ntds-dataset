    "Background": "Pathogens can impact host RNA modification machinery to establish a favorable cellular environment for their replication. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Toxoplasma gondii infection on host RNA modification profiles and explored how these modifications may influence the host-parasite interaction.",
    "Methodology/principal findings": "We analyzed the modification levels of \u223c 80 nt tRNA and 17\u201350 nt sncRNAs in mouse liver, spleen, and serum using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The results revealed alterations in RNA modification profiles, particularly during acute infection. The liver exhibited more differentially abundant RNA modifications than the spleen. RNA modification levels in serum were mostly downregulated during acute infection compared to control mice. Correlations were detected between different RNA modifications in the liver and spleen during infection and between several RNA modifications and many cytokines. Alterations in RNA modifications affected tRNA stability and protein translation.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "These findings provide new insight into the role of RNA modifications in mediating the murine host response to T. gondii infection."
