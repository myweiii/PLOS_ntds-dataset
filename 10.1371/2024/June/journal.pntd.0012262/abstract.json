    "Background": "Liver diseases of infectious and non-infectious etiology cause considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, data on the prevalence of liver diseases and underlying risk factors in LMICs are scarce. The objective of this study was to elucidate the occurrence of infectious diseases among individuals with chronic liver damage in a rural setting of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.",
    "Methodology": "In 2021, we screened 696 individuals from four villages in the southern part of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, employing transient elastography (TE) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). We classified CAP \u2265248 dB/m as steatosis, TE \u22657.2 kPa as fibrosis, and did subgroup analysis for participants with TE ranging from 7.2 kPa to 9.1 kPa. Clinical and microbiologic characteristics were compared to an age- and sex-matched control group (TE <6.0 kPa; n = 109). Stool samples were subjected to duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears for diagnosis of Schistosoma mansoni. Venous blood samples were examined for hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus. Additionally, an abdominal ultrasound examination was performed.",
    "Principal findings": "Among 684 individuals with valid TE measurements, TE screening identified hepatic pathologies in 149 participants (17% with fibrosis and 6% with steatosis). 419 participants were included for further analyses, of which 261 had complete microbiologic analyses available. The prevalence of S. mansoni, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were 30%, 14%, and 7%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed higher odds for having TE results between 7.2 kPa and 9.1 kPa in individuals with S. mansoni infection (odds ratio [OR] = 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.58\u20135.76, P = 0.001), while HCV infection (OR = 5.02, 95% CI = 1.72\u201314.69, P = 0.003) and steatosis (OR = 4.62, 95% CI = 1.60\u201313.35, P = 0.005) were found to be risk factors for TE \u22659.2 kPa.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "Besides viral hepatitis, S. mansoni also warrants consideration as a pathogen causing liver fibrosis in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. In-depth diagnostic work-up among individuals with abnormal TE findings might be a cost-effective public health strategy."
