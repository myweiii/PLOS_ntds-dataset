Dengue is a viral disease present in over 100 countries that is transmitted via mosquito bites. Most cases of dengue are associated with mild symptoms, with some cases leading to severe complications and even death. The clinical diagnosis of dengue is challenging because it presents with nonspecific symptoms that can be confused with those of other diseases, and specific laboratory tests are required for confirmation. In this study, children and adolescents who experienced a fever for 24 h to 10 d and had a clinical suspicion of dengue were evaluated and tested using specific laboratory methods. Negative samples were analyzed for leptospirosis and leishmaniasis because, despite being distinct diseases, they share certain clinical characteristics, such as different fever forms. Of the 86 children evaluated in this study, 39 were positive for dengue (45%), four for leptospirosis (5%), and one for leishmaniasis (1%). Therefore, a specific laboratory diagnosis is important, especially in children, to minimize morbidity and mortality.
