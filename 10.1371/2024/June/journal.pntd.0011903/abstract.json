    "Background": "The first dengue outbreak in Sao Tome and Principe was reported in 2022. Entomological investigations were undertaken to establish the typology of Aedes larval habitats, the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the related entomological risk and the susceptibility profile of Ae. aegypti to insecticides, to provide evidence to inform the outbreak response.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Entomological surveys were performed in all seven health districts of Sao Tome and Principe during the dry and rainy seasons in 2022. WHO tube and synergist assays using piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) were carried out, together with genotyping of F1534C/V1016I/V410L mutations in Ae. aegypti. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus were found in all seven health districts of the country with high abundance of Ae. aegypti in the most urbanised district, Agua Grande. Both Aedes species bred mainly in used tyres, discarded tanks and water storage containers. In both survey periods, the Breteau (BI > 50), house (HI > 35%) and container (CI > 20%) indices were higher than the thresholds established by WHO to indicate high potential risk of dengue transmission. The Ae. aegypti sampled were susceptible to all insecticides tested except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (9.2% mortality, resistant), bendiocarb (61.4% mortality, resistant) and alpha-cypermethrin (97% mortality, probable resistant). A full recovery was observed in Ae. aegypti resistant to bendiocarb after pre-exposure to synergist PBO. Only one Ae. aegypti specimen was found carrying F1534C mutation.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "These findings revealed a high potential risk for dengue transmission throughout the year, with the bulk of larval breeding occurring in used tyres, water storage and discarded containers. Most of the insecticides tested remain effective to control Aedes vectors in Sao Tome, except DDT and bendiocarb. These data underline the importance of raising community awareness and implementing routine dengue vector control strategies to prevent further outbreaks in Sao Tome and Principe, and elsewhere in the subregion."
