Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV) is a tick-borne pathogen that causes severe illness known as SFTS. This disease has become a major health concern, particularly in China, Japan and South Korea, with a high mortality rate. Regrettably, there are currently no vaccines or effective treatments available for this disease. To address this critical gap, we developed three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting a specific region of the SFTSV glycoprotein. Among these mAbs, one, named 40C10, exhibited remarkable neutralizing activity against SFTSV as well as related viruses such as HRTV and GTV. It provided complete protection against disease and death in mice even when administered days after viral exposure. These findings are promising and suggest that mAb 40C10 has potential as a therapeutic option against SFTSV. This work is a significant step towards meeting the urgent need for effective treatments for SFTS.
