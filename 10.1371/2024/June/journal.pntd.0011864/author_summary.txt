Enteric (typhoid) fever is caused by bacteria of Salmonella enterica species, specifically Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A. While the former is most commonly identified as the causative agent of enteric fever, S. Paratyphi A is increasing in prevalence in many endemic areas like Nepal. However, the understanding of the phylogenetic structure and population dynamics of this organism, as well as transmission patterns, remains incomplete. Here, we provide a detailed phylogenetic analysis of S. Paratyphi A isolated from enteric fever patients in Nepal through whole genome sequence analysis, combined with epidemiological observations, such as water source use, and chronological and location data. We observed an unusual expansion of a genotype (genetic ID) that replaced other genotypes in the area, indicative of changes in circulating population composition. This expansion is hypothesised to have been driven by reduction in antibiotic susceptibility and changes on bacterial structures that are important for pathogenicity. Our data also suggest person-to-person as the most likely mode of transmission for this pathogen. Understanding of S. Paratyphi A population structure, sources of infection, and transmission will help develop policies for enteric fever management, particularly prior to vaccine introduction, as changes in population composition may affect vaccine efficacy.
