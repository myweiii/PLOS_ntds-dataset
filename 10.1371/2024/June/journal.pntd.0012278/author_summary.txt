Chagas disease is a caused by American trypanosomes (Trypanosoma cruzi). These are microscopic parasites that circulate in wild mammals across most of the Americas and can also be transmitted to humans. Much of our knowledge about how T. cruzi causes Chagas disease comes from studies of infections in mice, but the data do not capture the full range of clinical outcomes seen in humans. For many other pathogens the hamster has proved to be a valuable model of human infections. We therefore aimed to apply some of the latest advances in T. cruzi infection imaging technology to studies in this alternative experimental model. In the early stages, parasites were widely disseminated throughout the body, but after several months parasites became almost entirely restricted to the skin. Hamsters did not show signs of heart or gut disease, which are common in humans, but they did develop skeletal muscle pathology. Stiffness in the hindlimbs grew progressively worse and resulted in a visibly altered gait, suggestive of damage to the nervous system. With further development, this model may therefore prove valuable in studies of peripheral nervous system involvement in Chagas disease.
