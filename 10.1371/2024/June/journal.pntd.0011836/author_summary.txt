In this research, we explored the complex interplay between temperature and the transmission risk of schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease currently affecting over two hundred million people, predominantly in SSA. We developed a novel mathematical model accounting for the multiple positive and negative ways temperature affects the free-living stages of the parasite and its obligate, non-human host, i.e., specific species of freshwater snails. Our models show that schistosomiasis transmission risk peaks at temperatures 1–6°C higher than previously estimated. This indicates that the impact of climate change on schistosomiasis transmission might be more extensive than previously thought, affecting a wide geographic range where mean annual temperatures are currently below the optimal temperature. Our model projections are consistent with the observed temperatures in locations of SSA where schistosomiasis is endemic and data on infection prevalence in the human population are available. These findings suggest that the current climate is conducive to schistosomiasis transmission, and future warming could escalate the risk further, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions in these regions.
