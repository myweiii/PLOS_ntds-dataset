This study addresses the treatment of hepatic cystic echinococcosis (HCE), a serious health concern in many parts of the world. Surgery has been the mainstay of the management which could be conservative or radical. Conservative surgery has high recurrence rates and complications as opposed to radical surgery. Through a prospective study, we showed that an improved and standardized a surgical technique of the conservative approach could achieve postoperative outcomes as good as the radical management. The standardized approach significantly reduced Deep Surgical Site Infections (DSSI) as well as overall morbidity rates in patients. This was achieved through various adjuncts such as methylene blue test, liver detachment, and omentoplasty.
