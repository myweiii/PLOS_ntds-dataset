    "Objective": "Surgery is the mainstay of hepatic cystic echinococcosis (HCE). The conservative surgery of HCE carries a non-negligible risk of recurrence and significant morbidity, dominated by Deep Surgical Site Infections (DSSI). To address these issues, we have improved and standardized this technique, which could reduce complications and achieve better postoperative outcomes.",
    "Patients and methods": "We conducted a prospective study from June 2017 to June 2022 involving of patient operated using a standardized open technique for uncomplicated HCE at Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia. The aim was to obtain results at least similar to radical management in terms of DSSI. Patients with large cystobiliary fistulas or patients with complicated cysts were excluded.",
    "Results": "Fifty patients with 106 cysts were operated using the standardized technique comprising of liver mobilization, intraoperative ultrasound, systematic methylene blue injection to detect cystobiliary fistulas and omentoplasty. The median age of the patients was 44(semi-interquartile range: 16) years. The main symptom described by the patient was pain in 43 cases (86%). An abnormal liver test was found in 20 cases (40%). On imaging studies, the cyst had a median size of 7.4(3.0) cm. Cyst of the hepatic dome accounted for 38 cases (35.8%) with most cysts being situated in the right hemi-liver. Visual inspection of the cavity and Methylene blue testing allowed for the discovery of 57 cysts (53.7%) that had cystobiliary fistulas that were sutured. Omentoplasty was performed in 77 cysts (72.6%). Postoperatively, only 2 cases (1.9%) developed a DSSI in the form of an external bile leak with resolved with conservative management. No case of recurrence was found after a median follow-up of 24 months.",
    "Conclusion": "The standardized conservative surgical technique, in selected patients, shows promise in reducing DSSI rates and overall morbidity, and achieve as equally good result as radical management."
