West Nile Virus is a disease that is spread by mosquitoes. Though it commonly infects birds, transmission to humans is possible and can lead to severe health effects. Temperature is known to affect the transmission cycle of West Nile virus, but it is unclear how global warming might change who, or how many people, may get infected with the virus. In this study, the researchers looked at how climate change may affect West Nile virus in California, and how health officials may better be able to predict future cases. The study found that there could be an increase in West Nile virus cases in humans due to increases in temperature in the next 20 years, but that we already have many tools and sources of data to predict cases. These findings reinforce the possible consequences of climate change on human health, and aid in the understanding in the complex relationship between climate and infectious diseases.
