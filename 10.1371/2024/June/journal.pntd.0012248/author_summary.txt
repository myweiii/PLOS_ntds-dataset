Although obesity and diabetes are known risk factors for severe dengue, there is limited information on whether they are risk factors for increased hospitalization due to dengue. To investigate this, we studied the association of obesity with hospitalization rates for dengue, in children aged 10 to 18 years (n = 4782), who were recruited from 9 districts in Sri Lanka using a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling method. Details of previous admissions to hospital due to dengue and anthropometric measurements were recorded and seropositivity rates for dengue were assessed. The body mass index centile (BMI) in children aged 10 to 18, was derived by plotting the values on the WHO BMI-for-age growth charts, to acquire the percentile ranking. We found that BMI centiles 50th to 85th and BMI centile of >97th were significantly associated with hospitalization rates when compared to children in other BMI categories, which should be further investigated in longitudinal prospective studies.
