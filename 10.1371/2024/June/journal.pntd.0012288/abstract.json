    "Abstract": "Chagas disease predominantly affects the heart, esophagus, and colon in its chronic phase. However, the precise infection mechanisms of the causal agent Trypanosoma cruzi in these tissue types remain incompletely understood. This study investigated T. cruzi infection dynamics in skeletal (SM) and cardiac myotubes (CM) differentiated from H9c2(2\u20131) myoblasts (control). SM and CM were generated using 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) without or with retinoic acid, respectively. Initial invasion efficiencies and numbers of released parasites were equivalent between undifferentiated and differentiated cells (~0.3\u20130.6%). Concomitantly, parasite motility patterns were similar across cell lines. However, CM demonstrated significantly higher infection kinetics over time, reaching 13.26% infected cells versus 3.12% for SM and 3.70% for myoblasts at later stages. Cellular automata modeling suggested an enhanced role for cell-to-cell transmission in driving the heightened parasitism observed in CM. The increased late-stage susceptibility of CM, potentially mediated by cell-to-cell transfer mechanisms of the parasite, aligns with reported clinical tropism patterns. The myotube infection models provide novel insights into Chagas disease pathogenesis that are not fully attainable through in vivo examination alone. Expanding knowledge in this area could aid therapeutic development for this neglected illness."
