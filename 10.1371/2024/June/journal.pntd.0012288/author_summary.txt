Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite that causes Chagas disease. While most initial infections are cleared by the immune system, some people develop a chronic infection that can emerge decades later and damage the heart or digestive system. This study aimed to understand why the heart is preferentially affected. We studied the infection dynamics of T. cruzi in different muscle cell models cultured in vitro: myoblast cells, and cardiac muscle-like or skeletal muscle-like cells differentiated from myoblasts. All three cell types were equally susceptible to initial parasite invasion. However, at later times, the cardiac muscle cell model displayed higher overall infection levels compared to the other cell types. Examining intracellular and released parasites over time revealed that cardiac cells harbored more parasites at later infection stages, despite similar parasite release across models. This ruled out shedding as the cause of disparate infection levels. Mathematical modeling suggested that higher rates of cell-to-cell transmission drive elevated late-stage infection in the cardiac model. Comparing infection kinetics between models provides insights into heart susceptibility to chronic damage from T. cruzi in vivo. Understanding disease mechanisms could aid prevention and treatment strategies for this important health issue.
