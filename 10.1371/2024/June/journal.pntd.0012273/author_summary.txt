New generation typhoid conjugate vaccines have been introduced in mass national campaigns and routine immunization programs in several typhoid-endemic countries. We evaluated evidence for spatial and temporal clustering of typhoid fever in an urban slum area of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where typhoid is highly endemic. We assessed 141 typhoid index cases and observed the highest incidence of typhoid in the 14-day period following case selection in the population residing closest (cluster of radii 0-50-meter) to the index case. Clustering of incident cases suggests a higher intensity of transmission, and the populations at highest risk of contracting typhoid are those living in close proximity to an index case. The risk exists for a period of at least 28 days. Where strong surveillance exists, vaccination of localized geographic areas surrounding cases might be effective in controlling disease outbreaks in low- or no-coverage settings. This approach could offer a practical and efficient strategy for countries with limited data and resources to support mass typhoid vaccination. Additional evaluations of spatial and temporal trends of typhoid transmission are required in endemic and non-endemic settings, and studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of targeted vaccination are needed to refine prevention and control strategies.
