Our research employs a stochastic model to analyze the early-stage spread of Ebolavirus Disease. We incorporated factors such as healthcare workers and unreported cases, and utilized real data to evaluate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on disease transmission. Our findings indicate that rapid outbreak recognition could effectively control disease spread with reduced efforts. For example, if outbreak recognition occurred just one day after the first death, the level of non-pharmaceutical intervention required would have been 45% less than the baseline scenario, causing the same outbreak scale. On the contrary, a one-week delay in outbreak recognition required 50% higher non-pharmaceutical interventions. Furthermore, we explored the potential implementation of a vaccination strategy following an outbreak declaration. The vaccine administration, similar to early outbreak recognition, could reduce the burden of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In the model simulation, if 20% of the considered population (100,000) were vaccinated within 50 days after outbreak recognition, the level of non-pharmaceutical intervention required could be reduced by 40%. Our results suggest that such a strategy could mitigate both the scale of the outbreak and the necessity for additional interventions.
