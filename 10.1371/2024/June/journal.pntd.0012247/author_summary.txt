Fusariosis is an infectious disease caused by fungi belonging to fusarioid species. They are called “fusarioid” because there are other genus genetically related to Fusarium, which may cause the same disease. These microorganisms can be found in nature, specifically in different hosts, including agri-food and ornamental plants, forest trees, the soil and decomposing wood. Nevertheless, Fusarium spp. can cause diseases in vegetables, being considered phytopathogens. They can also cause infections in domestic animals such as dogs and horses as well as in seahorses, turtles, dolphins and pinnipeds. In humans, and in severely immunocompromised patients, fusariosis is the second most common systemic fungal infection, after invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. In addition to systemic infections, these fungi can cause superficial infections, such as dermatomycosis (mainly onychomycosis) and keratitis. Keratitis is an infection of the eye that may lead to blindness. In developed countries, it is mostly related to poor contact lens cleaning. However, in developing and tropical countries like Brazil, the most common source of contamination is through trauma of the eye, especially by plant material containing fungal spores. Therefore, this is a disease essentially related to poor agriculture workers. Therefore, we decided to have a look how keratitis and other fusarioid infections affect this specific population in the lowest income region of my country. We also investigated biofilm (organized fungal communities important for pathogenicity) formation in the strains recovered from these patients and their genetic relatedness. Another question that we wanted to answer was which antifungal drugs could be used to treat them.
