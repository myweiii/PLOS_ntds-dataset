    "Background": "Fusarium and allied genera (fusarioid) species are common colonizers of roots and aerial plant parts, or act as phytopathogens in forestry and horticultural or grain crops. However, they can also cause a wide range of infections in humans, including onychomycosis, cutaneous and invasive infections. Fusarioid keratitis is characterized by an infection of the cornea with a suppurative and ulcerative appearance, which may cause damage to vision and permanent blindness. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of fusarioid species, biofilm formation and antifungal susceptibility profiling of clinical isolates recovered from patients with keratitis and dermatomycoses.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "The study was performed between March, 2012-December, 2022. Demographic, clinical and epidemiological data of patients were also collected. In the present study, most of the patients with keratitis were male (74%), had a median age of 42 years old, worked with plant material or debris and 26% of them reported eye trauma. Regarding dermatomycosis, most of patients were female and exhibited toenail lesions. Forty-seven isolates belonged to the genus Neocosmospora (78.33%), nine to the Fusarium fujikuroi (15%) and four to the Fusarium oxysporum (6.66%) species complexes. Several strains were moderate biofilm producers, specifically among Fusarium annulatum. Most strains showed increased MICs to amphotericin B and ketoconazole and low MICs to itraconazole. MICs ranged from 0.25 to 16 \u03bcg/mL for amphotericin B, 0.0625 to >16 \u03bcg/mL for ketoconazole and 0.125 to 8 for itraconazole.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "It is possible to conclude that fusarioid keratitis in Northeastern Brazil is an important and neglected disease, given the high number of cases, increased need for keratoplasty and poor outcome of the disease."
