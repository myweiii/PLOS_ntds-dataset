Usutu virus is a zoonotic arbovirus that emerged in the last decades in Europe, impacting wild bird and human populations. Several co-circulating USUV lineages differ in their virulence to vertebrate hosts but their relative transmission and effects on their mosquito vectors is still not known. We compared the vector competence and survival of Culex pipiens mosquitoes experimentally infected with two distinct USUV lineages. We showed that their relative transmission efficiencies are similar but EU3 was more virulent to mosquitoes than EU2. In addition to published results, we revealed lineage-specific differences in vectorial capacity and virulence to both the vector and the vertebrate host suggesting that propagation of both viral lineages might be balanced. Our study provides new insights into the transmission of an emerging arbovirus and highlights the need to investigate the interactions between vectors, vertebrate hosts, and the diversity of arbovirus lineages to fully understand transmission dynamics.
