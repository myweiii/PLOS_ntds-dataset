All experiments on arthropods have been performed on the Baillarguet insectarium platform (https://doi.org/10.18167/infrastructure/00001), member of the National Infrastructure EMERG’IN and of the Vectopole Sud network (http://www.vectopole-sud.fr/). The Baillarguet insectarium platform is led by the joint units Intertryp (IRD, CIRAD) and ASTRE (CIRAD, INRAE). We thank Y. Simonin (UMR PCCEI) and N. Dheilly (UMR VIRO) for providing EU2 and EU3 virus isolates, F. Munoz for support in data visualization. We also thank the staff from La Tour du Valat for allowing us to collect Culex pipiens larvae. We thank Mylène Weill for helpful comments on this manuscript.
