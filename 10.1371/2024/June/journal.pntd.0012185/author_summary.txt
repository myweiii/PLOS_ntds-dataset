Molecular monitoring of ticks for pathogen nucleic acids is informative when used in the surveillance of diseases transmitted by ticks. In the view of the limited information of genetic aspects of either ticks or their pathogen burdens in Egypt, it is crucial to give more attention into this direction to overcome the consequences might happen due to the caused diseases. We investigated three tick species (Rhipicephalus rutilus, Rh. annulatus, and Hyalomma dromedarii). These ticks are well-established in Egypt, infesting dogs, sheep, cattle, and camel among other hosts. The ticks were screened for the presence of different bacterial and protozoan pathogens using PCR technique for four years. The findings showed a prevalence of bacterial agents overall the ticks, followed by the protozoans. Surprisingly, the ticks showed different degrees of co-infections along with single infections. The data provided in this study should be used as a base in the construction of the “One health approach” that is being adopted by the country to protect the lives of both humans and their companion animals.
