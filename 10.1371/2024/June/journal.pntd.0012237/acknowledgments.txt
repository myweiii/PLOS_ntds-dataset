We would like to thank the Campoalegre community that helped us with the collection and fieldwork. We want to thank Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) for contributing not only to the logistic in the field but also to the collection and identification of sand flies. Also, we are thankful to Universidad de La Salle for their support with laboratory materials.
