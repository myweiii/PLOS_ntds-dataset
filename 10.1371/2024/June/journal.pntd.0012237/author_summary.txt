Understanding the population dynamics of Pintomyia longiflocosa (named before like Lutzomyia longiflocosa), and its interaction with ecological variables is crucial for devising effective strategies to control sand fly populations and combat cutaneous leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease, and a significant public health challenge in tropical countries like Colombia. To investigate this, we collected adult sand flies from outdoor, indoor, and peri-domestic areas in Campoalegre, Huila, Colombia, The density of Pi. longiflocosa, comprising 98.86% of the collected sand flies, with females contributing more to the overall density. Outdoor areas exhibited the highest density, highlighting their importance in the transmission of the disease. Additionally, the density of this sand flies showed a seasonal pattern, peaking from February to June and October, aligning with the local climate conditions. Notably, precipitation emerged as a significant environmental variable, displaying a negative correlation with sand fly density. Months with higher rainfall had lower abundance of Pi. longiflocosa. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the population dynamics of the sand fly vector and its correlation with ecological factors, paving the way for effective control strategies to combat cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia.
