This work would not have been accomplished without the assistance of SUA, MRRH and Doctors staff, and Laboratory scientists of Department of Microbiology Laboratory at the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, SUA, for analyses of samples. I appreciate the parents or guardians’ contribution to this study. Additionally, I would like to thank the Morogoro Regional Referral Hospital’s medical personnel, nursing staff, and administrative offices for recruiting participants. Additionally, I recognise the efforts of individuals who contributed to data collection with compensation. I am also grateful to Prof. Gerald Misinzo, who assisted in ethics application and subject recruitment for the National Institute of Medical Research, and Dr. George Alcard Rweyemamu, who assisted in Clinical Management System checking at Morogoro Regional Referral Hospital.
