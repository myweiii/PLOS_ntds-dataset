Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) is a serious disease caused by the Hantavirus and transmitted by rodents. Meteorological factors, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, can influence the occurrence, spread, and outbreak of HFRS. However, the relationship between climate change and its impact on the disease is complex, and more research is needed to provide a strong scientific basis for the development of adaptation strategies. This study employs a novel technique called Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) to investigate the time-delayed non-linear relationships between meteorological factors and HFRS outbreaks in Weifang. The results show that meteorological factors can drive the transmission of HFRS both at a macroscopic and microscopic scale. The relationship between temperature (lagged by 2 weeks) and HFRS incidence exhibits an inverted U-shaped curve, with the highest incidence occurring at 10 °C. Changes in meteorological conditions, such as increases in temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation, can lead to an upsurge in the incidence of HFRS after 4–6 months. The findings of this study are crucial for public health officials and policymakers to take timely measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on the spread of HFRS.
