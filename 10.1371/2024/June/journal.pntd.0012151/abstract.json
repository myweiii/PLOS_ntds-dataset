    "Background": "Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) continues to pose a significant public health threat to the well-being of the population. Given that the spread of HFRS is susceptible to meteorological factors, we aim to probe into the meteorological drivers of HFRS. Thus, novel techniques that can discern time-delayed non-linear relationships from nonlinear dynamical systems are compulsory.",
    "Methods": "We analyze the epidemiological features of HFRS in Weifang City, 2011\u20132020, via the employment of the Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) method. Our analysis delves into the intricate web of time-delayed non-linear associations between meteorological factors and HFRS. Additionally, we investigate the repercussions of minor perturbations in meteorological variables on future HFRS incidence.",
    "Results": "A total of 2515 HFRS cases were reported in Weifang from 2011 to 2020. The number of cases per week was 4.81, and the average weekly incidence was 0.52 per 1,000,000. The propagation of HFRS is significantly impacted by the mean weekly temperature, relative humidity, cumulative rainfall, and wind speed, and the \u03c1CCM converges to 0.55,0.48,0.38 and 0.39, respectively.",
    "Conclusions": "Our discoveries suggest that meteorological factors can drive the transmission of HFRS both at a macroscopic and microscopic scale. Prospective alterations in meteorological conditions, for instance, elevations in temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation will instigate an upsurge in the incidence of HFRS after 4\u20136 months, and thus, timely public health measures should be taken to mitigate these changes."
