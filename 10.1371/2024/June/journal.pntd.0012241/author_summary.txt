Diarrheal diseases are the second-leading cause of death in children under five years, and Campylobacter is a major global causative agent. However, little attention is given to the accurate isolation, characterization, and AMR assessment of Campylobacter in sub-Saharan Africa. This region has the highest burden of diarrhea but a lack of organized laboratories. This study investigated the presence and AMR of Campylobacter in children and animals using methods with minimal technical challenge.
We collected stool samples from 303 children at health centers and 711 animal feces samples from the childrenâ€™s homes in the vicinity of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Campylobacter were isolated using membrane filtration-culture. Presumptive isolates were characterized with molecular techniques in Belgium. Membrane filtration culture with a traditional microaerobic incubation system was successful in isolating viable Campylobacter from children with diarrhea and animals. Campylobacter is highly prevalent in children, backyard poultry, and dogs and has shown resistance to ciprofloxacin and doxycycline. The key findings of this study clearly show that Campylobacter infection in children and its occurrence in animals associated with children is a major public health problem. These findings are supportive of clinical decision-making and treatment. Findings from this study are also relevant as a validation of applying the membrane filtration-isolation technique for Campylobacter screening in low-income countries.
