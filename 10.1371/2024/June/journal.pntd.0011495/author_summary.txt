This study was carried out in the Nata catchment area in Tutume district, Botswana. It aimed to assess the burden, risk factors informing effective disease control programs. The survey involved interviews and skin examination by a health worker. Findings revealed a higher prevalence of scabies cases, while impetigo cases were less prevalent. These results highlight the need for community-wide interventions to mitigate the diseaseâ€™s impact. Identified risk factors include younger age, residing with an individual experiencing itchiness, and infrequent bathing. Overall, this study supports advocating for scabies as a neglected tropical disease.
