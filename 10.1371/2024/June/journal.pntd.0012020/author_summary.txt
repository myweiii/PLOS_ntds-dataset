Bovine trypanosomosis is a disease that threatens cattle health and agriculture in South America and Africa. It is mainly caused by the parasite Trypanosoma vivax. Diagnosis of this infection has been challenging, hampering efforts to monitor and control outbreaks. In this study, we developed a more accurate and sensitive test for detecting T. vivax in cattle. Using recombinant proteins tailored to parasite strains in the Americas, this new test can identify infection rates and patterns within cattle herds and regions. By analyzing over 800 cattle blood samples from Argentina ranchlands, we discovered over 50% seropositivity, indicating a far higher prevalence than previously recognized. These results highlight the urgent need for surveillance and preventive strategies, although diagnostic tools provide a means for tracking regional spread. By enhancing the diagnosis of this livestock disease, this study lays the foundation for protecting cattle health and associated livelihoods across at-risk communities in the developing world. This study exemplifies how molecular innovations can address veterinary challenges and promote food security within resource-constrained farming systems.
