This article describes the diversity of Astroviruses (AstVs) shed by Malagasy terrestrial small mammals and explores the impact of habitat degradation on positivity rate in animal reservoirs. Using a sample of 515 terrestrial small mammals from northeastern Madagascar, we show that AstV infection is almost exclusively restricted to rats and mice, suggesting that AstVs from terrestrial mammals were introduced to Madagascar. A phylogenetic analysis including AstVs sequences from Malagasy small mammals reveals a strong structuring of AstV sequences within host species, indicating limited host switching of these viruses among small mammals. Finally, positivity rates show that some habitat types are particularly conducive to AstV infection in reservoirs, such as rice fields where mice exhibit maximal infection. Altogether, presented data encourage the need for assessing the actual exposure of the local human population to the AstVs in small mammals, especially rice-field farmers.
