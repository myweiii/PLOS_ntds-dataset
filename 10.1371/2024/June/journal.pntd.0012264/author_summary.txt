Yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreaks persist in certain regions, emphasizing the need for effective inactivation methods. Our study focused on the YFV 17D vaccine strain, evaluating its susceptibility to commonly used disinfectants. Surprisingly, despite a prolonged half-life of ~13 days at room temperature, YFV proved susceptible to alcohols, WHO-recommended hand rubs, and most surface disinfectants tested. Consistent with these findings, WHO-recommended hand rubs effectively inactivated two pathogenic strains of YFV. This is essential information for establishing protocols to curb YFV transmission beyond vector-related scenarios. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of YFV control, offering practical insights that can inform public health measures.
