    "Background": "The long-term mortality and morbidity of patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) remain unclear.",
    "Methods": "This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Service dataset on hospitalized patients with SFTS aged \u226520 years between 2016 and 2021 (n = 1,217). Each SFTS case was matched with three controls hospitalized for non-SFTS-related diseases using propensity score matching. The all-cause mortality of patients with SFTS was evaluated during the one-year follow-up and compared with that of controls. Post-discharge events were investigated to determine the effects of SFTS on post-acute sequelae.",
    "Results": "Finally, 1,105 patients with SFTS and 3,315 controls were included. Patients with SFTS had a higher risk of death during the one-year follow-up than that of controls (hazard ratio [HR], 2\u00b726; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1\u00b782\u20132\u00b781). Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in the SFTS group (HR, 3\u00b799; 95% CI, 3\u00b707\u20135\u00b719) than in the control group. An increased risk of death after 31\u2013365 days was observed among controls, though this difference was significant only among patients in their 80s (HR, 0\u00b718; 95% CI, 0\u00b706\u20130\u00b757). For post-discharge events, patients in the SFTS group exhibited a higher risk of readmission (HR, 1\u00b717; 95% CI, 1\u00b704\u20131\u00b732) and emergency room visit (HR, 2\u00b732; 95% CI, 1\u00b796\u20132\u00b776) than those in the control group.",
    "Conclusion": "SFTS induces a higher risk of short-term mortality and post-acute sequelae in hospitalized patients during a one-year follow-up than non-SFTS-related diseases. Our results provide guidance for the management of SFTS."
