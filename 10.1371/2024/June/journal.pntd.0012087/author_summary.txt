Mpox is a zoonotic illness caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), for which there are two distinct sub-clades. Clade I is typically found in central Africa and is associated with worse patient outcomes than Clade II. Diagnosis of mpox is most commonly performed using PCR, but in settings with limited laboratory capacity diagnosis is usually performed on clinical grounds taking lesion presentation in to account. Lesion presentation is also used to assess patient outcomes in both clinical and research settings. However, there has been no investigation into whether clinicians can (i) identify Clade I mpox compared to other viral lesions (ii) differentiate between Clade I mpox lesion stages, which has important implications for clinical practice, research and public health. Our study, which presented 16 clinicians with 17 sets of images of Clade I mpox or varicella and asked them to i) provide the most likely diagnosis and ii) categorise the lesions in to their stages, demonstrates that there are presently limitations in using visual assessment to diagnose Clade I mpox and evaluate lesion stage and treatment outcomes. Alternative methods and tools are therefore required that can be easily implemented in affected countries.
