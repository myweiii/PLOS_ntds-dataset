The persistence of Plasmodium vivax poses a significant public health concern in certain regions, particularly Southeast Asia. The distinctive biology of Plasmodium vivax presents challenges for its control and eradication efforts. The development of a transmission-blocking vaccine is considered an essential strategy for malaria elimination, while the identification of antigen candidates plays a critical role in vaccine development. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of PvPSOP25 as a transmission-blocking vaccine candidate using the transgenic murine parasite P. berghei. The transmission-reducing activity of anti-rPvPSOP25 sera was evaluated by both in vitro and mosquito-feeding experiments. Additionally, a direct membrane feeding assay using clinical P. vivax isolates from Thailand further validated the moderate transmission-reducing activity exhibited by the anti-rPvPSOP25 antisera.
