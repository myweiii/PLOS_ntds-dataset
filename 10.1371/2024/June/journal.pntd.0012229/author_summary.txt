Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that can be fatal in humans if left untreated. Unfortunately, despite the urgent need, an efficacious vaccine for this parasitic disease continues to remain under development. Though challenging, we attempted to develop an experimental leishmaniasis vaccine using the highly immunogenic virus-like particle (VLP) platform that expressed the glycoprotein 63 antigen of Leishmania donovani, a causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. We used this vaccine to immunize mice and after two immunizations, mice were challenge infected with L. donovani to assess vaccine-induced protection. Our results revealed that compared to the unimmunized control mice, mice immunized with the experimental vaccines were well-protected against developing visceral leishmaniasis. Specifically, VLP vaccine immunization ensured that immune responses necessary for protection were induced to high levels and this contributed to suppressing leishmaniasis-associated pathologies as well as the parasite propagation in mice. Overall, we demonstrated that this VLP-based vaccine can elicit adequate protection against visceral leishmaniasis and propose further research to enhance and optimize its efficacy.
