Brazil has implemented tafenoquine and quantitative G6PD testing as a crucial component of its comprehensive strategy to eliminate Plasmodium vivax malaria. Training of healthcare professionals (HCPs) has played a pivotal role in facilitating the adoption of these new strategies. In any implementation, it is necessary to identify barriers and facilitators and consider data that cannot typically be collected in purely quantitative studies. This qualitative study describes the perceptions of HCPs regarding the training they received and the knowledge gaps that only became apparent in their professional practice after the training. These insights were instrumental in developing various communication and continuing education strategies that enhanced HCP knowledge following training. Finally, the study presents a training approach for applying quantitative G6PD testing and the tafenoquine treatment regimen, including the most effective educational activities and materials to support the HCP learning process.
