Dengue is a viral illness spread by mosquitoes in Southeast Asia and South America, and about half of the world’s population is at risk. Burden-of-illness studies on the economic impact of dengue typically focus on medical costs. However, the impact of this infectious disease extends far beyond healthcare costs. This study evaluated the impact of dengue on gross domestic product (GDP) based on approaches tailored to two dengue-endemic countries, Thailand and Brazil. The analyses estimated that the dengue outbreak in 2019 had a profound impact on Thailand’s tourism industry, reducing GDP by an estimated US$1.81 billion, equivalent to 3% of annual tourism revenues or 0.33% of total GDP. Dengue also impacted Brazil’s workforce in 2019, leading to an estimated 22.4 million lost workdays, of which 39% were associated with the informal sector, and reducing GDP overall by US$876 million (0.05% of total GDP). Informal workers are vulnerable to dengue-related financial burdens, and a low income can be a barrier to seeking medical care for dengue. This study highlights the broader economic impact of dengue beyond healthcare costs and underscores the importance of a combination of public health measures, such as vector control and vaccination.
