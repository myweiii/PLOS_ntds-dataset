American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL), a tropical disease, appears to be of great concern to the gold miners working in the Guiana Shield region. Indeed, many gold miners working in French Guiana are originally from Brazil. The frequency of Leishmania infection, the clinical features of lesions and scars of ATL, and the demographic characteristics were described among this population. A cross-sectional study was carried out from October to December 2019 in Oiapoque city, Amap√°, Brazil. A total of 105 participants were recruited. Suspected Leishmania infection was confirmed by the detection of Leishmania kDNA or detection of specific immune response to leishmanial antigens. Nine active ATL, 38 healed ATL (hATL) and 58 cases with no history of ATL (noATL), were identified. Only half of the treated hATL (50.0%; n = 14) reported having been assisted by a health care unit and the others treated themselves. Taking the laboratory techniques and the clinical evaluations together, 76% (n = 80) of participants had evidence of Leishmania infection. These results suggests that illegal gold miners working in French Guiana are at high risk for infection with different species of Leishmania, but their illegal condition and remoteness make it difficult for them to access health services.
