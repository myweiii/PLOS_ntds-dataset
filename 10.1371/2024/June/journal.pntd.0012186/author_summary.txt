La Crosse virus (LACV) is the most common cause of mosquito-borne neuroinvasive disease (e.g., encephalitis or meningitis) among children in the United States, but the spatial patterns and population-level risk factors for LACV infections are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the spatial patterns and areal risk factors of pediatric LACV neuroinvasive disease (LACV-ND) in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, a persistent hotspot of LACV-ND. We found that from 2003–2020, the highest risks of pediatric LACV-ND consistently occurred in a few areas within the study region. We also found that precipitation and temperature had positive but antagonistic relationships with area-level risk from 2015–2020, although the strength of those associations varied significantly across the study area. The results of this study have important implications for public health policy. Most notably, because LACV-ND consistently occurs in the same geographic areas over extended time periods, areas where cases have been previously reported should be prioritized for disease prevention programs to prevent continuous transmission. This study also provides initial evidence that climate may be related to the distribution of LACV-ND risk, but additional research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between climate and LACV epidemiology.
