In the year 2000, the World Health Organization initiated the mass drug administration program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. Sri Lanka implemented the program for five years (2002â€“2006), offering yearly single doses of anti-filarial treatment to the eligible population of all eight endemic districts. In 2016, Sri Lanka was acknowledged as having eliminated lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. This study explored the impact of the mass drug administration program on lymphoedema and hydrocele/spermatoceles passive case detection rates using filaria clinic and hospital admission data. A reduction in new lymphoedema case visits to filaria clinics and hospital admissions for hydrocele/spermatoceles management was noted two decades after implementing mass anti-filarial treatment in Sri Lanka.
