Haemophilus ducreyi (HD) is one of the main causative agents of cutaneous ulcers in children across substantial parts of Africa and the Pacific. A yaws eradication study conducted in the Namatanai district of Papua New Guinea revealed that nearly one-third of all patients were infected with HD. Single locus sequence typing (SLST) of the HD dsrA locus revealed presence of multiple HD strains circulating in the human population of Namatanai region. In contrast to Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue, the pathogen responsible for yaws, the prevalence of HD strains did not significantly decrease following mass drug administration. In addition, HD strains from patients in Namatanai region revealed a higher genetic diversity compared to the yaws agent present in the same area and the HD strain composition changed following antibiotic treatment. Infections caused by at least some different HD strain types appear to differ in reported ulcer duration and also in resurgence of infection after antibiotic treatment. Therefore, important pathophysiological differences among HD strain types were predicted.
