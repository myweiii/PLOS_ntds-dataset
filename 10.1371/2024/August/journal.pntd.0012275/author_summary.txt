Climate anomalies appear to have played an important role in facilitating the establishment of a new invasive strain in the 6th cholera pandemic, with climate and environmental conditions similar to those underlying strain changes associated with ENSO in todayâ€™s Bangladesh. The evolutionary change of pathogens can act synergistically with climatic conditions in the replacement and geographical propagation of emerging strains. Increased climate variability and extremes under global warming would thus provide new windows of opportunity for emerging pathogens/re-emerging cholera outbreaks.
