Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating tropical disease caused by infection with parasitic filarial worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. Long-term infection can lead to stigmatising chronic conditions like lymphoedema and elephantiasis. The World Health Organization initiated the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (GPELF) in 2000, focusing on mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-LF drugs to stop transmission in endemic countries. However, to monitor the success of this programme and to make informed decisions to stop costly MDA, it is crucial to have access to accurate and reliable rapid diagnostics. Here, we evaluated the performance of a new rapid antigen test called the Q Filariasis antigen test and compared it to the currently recommended filariasis test strip under field laboratory conditions in Samoa. This study showed that the new rapid test could be a suitable alternative to the currently recommended test for use in GPELF-related activities with more user-friendly features.
