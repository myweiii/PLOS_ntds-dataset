Many triatomine species carry the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, a flagellate protozoan that causes Chagas disease in animals and humans, posing a long-standing public health threat to communities in the Global South. We investigated how the niche of triatominae species correlates with their geographic range. We compiled a comprehensive dataset on their feeding habits and environmental preferences and found that temperature and precipitation niche breadth correlated geographic range size but dietary breadths did not. These findings highlight the complexity of ecological relationships and contribute to a better understanding of how species interact with their environment, and can play a crucial role in determining the range of these vectors. Thus, this knowledge can aid in the development of more effective strategies for managing vector-borne diseases.
