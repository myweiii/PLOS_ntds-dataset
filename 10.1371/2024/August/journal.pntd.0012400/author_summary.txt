In this study, we looked at whether a method used to control the spread of the pork tapeworm, a parasite transmitted between pig and people, in Peru could also work in Zambia. The method involved treating people and pigs living near animals infected with tapewormlarvae.
We conducted the study in a community where the spread of the parasite via infected meat had been successfully stopped. Every few months, we sampled pigs and people in the area and treated those who were found to be infected or at risk. If a pig tested positive for the parasite, everyone within 50 meters of that pig was treated.
Between June 2018 and October 2019, we did four rounds of sampling and treatment. Most people were willing to provide stool samples, and a large percentage of pigs were sampled as well. During treatment, most eligible people and pigs within the affected area received treatment.
The study found that people were willing to participate and get treated once the treatment rings were set up. However, there are challenges with accurately diagnosing the parasite in pigs and getting stool samples from people. Before recommending this method to health authorities, further improvements are needed.
