Loiasis has long been considered a negligible infection, however disease perception is changing as more data on significant disease-associated morbidity and mortality are being published. Still, many important aspects of the disease, such as the socioeconomic impact, are unknown. This study was part of a larger project on loiasis associated disease burden and aimed to evaluate healthcare seeking behaviors and estimate associated costs in individuals with loiasis living in a highly endemic region. We found that loiasis is associated with healthcare consultation, self-medicating, and sick leave. Self-medicating for treatment of disease specific symptoms was frequent. Traditional treatments and pain medication were most frequently used. Based on these data, we estimated loiasis related direct healthcare costs and indirect costs due to sickness, resulting in a monetary burden of US-$ 58 (95% CI: 21–101) per loiasis positive individual per year. Extrapolating these numbers to the rural population of Gabon (n = 204,000) would correspond to a monetary burden of US-$ 3,206,000 (95% CI: 1,150,000–5,577,000). Thus, loiasis is not only associated with morbidity and mortality but also with healthcare-seeking and may cause a relevant socioeconomic burden on affected populations. Therefore, considering loiasis a negligible disease is not appropriate anymore.
