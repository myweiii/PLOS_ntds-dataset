Scabies is a parasitic infestation of the outermost layer of the skin. Disease symptoms such as papular rash (mainly involving the crevices of the body), severe generalized itch and stigma attached to the infestation are believed to impair the quality of life of scabies patients. Despite the need for data, there is limited evidence about the relationship between scabies and quality of life. This study presents novel data on quality of life impairment associated with scabies and which aspects of patientsâ€™ day-to-day lives are the most affected. This study was conducted in an outbreak-affected area of north-western Ethiopia where scabies had a moderate impact on the quality of life of the affected people. Disease symptoms and their psychosocial impact contributed the most to quality of life impairment. Participants in this study came from different sociodemographic backgrounds. Nonetheless, there were no major differences in DLQI scores by background characteristics.
