Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that causes approximately 200,000 deaths worldwide each year. Urogenital schistosomiasis is caused by Schistosoma haematobium, which ultimately leads to lesions in the urinary tract due to egg deposition by the parasite. The World Health Organization recommends regular mass administration of praziquantel to prevent chronicity of the disease in high-endemicity areas. Preschool children are one of the most vulnerable groups, however, only children over two years of age are included in these strategies. The diagnostic techniques commonly used in endemic areas for egg detection by microscopy and urine hematuria have major limitations due to their low sensitivity. These limitations lead to misdiagnosis and undetected infections may eventually lead to the chronic form of the disease. Real-time PCR and microscopy were used to diagnose urogenital schistosomiasis in preschool children in Cubal, a high-transmission municipality in Angola. Urinary tract lesions were assessed by ultrasound. Of the samples tested, 64.95% were positive by real-time PCR, compared with 37.11% by microscopy, indicating sensitivities of 95.45% and 54.55%, respectively. Ultrasound analysis showed urinary tract alterations in 23.94% of the children. The results suggest that transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis in preschool children in Cubal is higher than previously estimated.
