Paragonimiasis, a foodborne zoonotic parasitic disease caused by lung flukes (Paragonimus spp.), remains a significant neglected public health threat in many Asian countries, including China. Human infection occurs through the ingestion of raw or undercooked freshwater crab or crayfish containing the metacercariae stage. Given the popularity of consuming raw or undercooked freshwater products in many areas of China, understanding the infection status and spatial distribution of Paragonimus spp. in humans and animal hosts is crucial for controlling paragonimiasis. Our study provides a comprehensive summary of the infection levels of the two most important zoonotic Paragonimus species, P. westermani and P. skrjabini, in humans and animal hosts in China, along with a description of the spatial distribution and environmental characteristics of their endemic areas. We observe a wide distribution of Paragonimus infection in China, with a significant prevalence found in freshwater crabs and crayfish. Our findings underscore the importance of avoiding the consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater products to prevent foodborne diseases, including paragonimiasis.
