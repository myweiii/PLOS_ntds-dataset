Tsetse flies (Glossina sp.) are vectors of Trypanosoma brucei parasites that cause human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. As part of disease surveillance, tsetse can be captured in traps and checked for parasite presence. The molecular screening of disease vectors (such as mosquitoes, ticks and blackflies) for the presence of pathogen DNA has gained popularity in recent years. However, DNA contamination may occur at capture when live vectors are retained for a limited period in a trap cage. To explore this, we conducted experiments, initially with laboratory-reared tsetse and then field-caught tsetse from Tanzania. Our results show that infected tsetse can contaminate uninfected tsetse with T. brucei DNA when retained together in a trap cage, and that the level of contamination can be extensive. Infected tsetse consistently shed T. brucei DNA in their faeces, which in turn contaminates other tsetse. This can produce false-positive results, leading to inaccurate reporting of infection prevalence. These findings impact not only trypanosomiasis surveillance, but may also have ramifications for the xenomonitoring of other vector-borne neglected diseases. Future work should explore whether pathogen DNA contamination routes exist in other vector species and, if so, the methods to mitigate DNA contamination in entomological traps.
