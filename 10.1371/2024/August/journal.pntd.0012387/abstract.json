    "Background": "Dengue remains a persistent public health concern, especially in tropical and sub-tropical countries like Thailand. The development and utilization of quantitative tools and information technology show significant promise for enhancing public health policy decisions in integrated dengue control. However, the effective implementation of these tools faces multifaceted challenges and barriers that are relatively underexplored.",
    "Methods": "This qualitative study employed in-depth interviews to gain a better understanding of the experiences and challenges of quantitative tool development and implementation with key stakeholders involved in dengue control in Thailand, using a phenomenological framework. A diverse range of participants, including public health workers and dengue control experts, participated in these interviews. The collected interview data were systematically managed and investigated using thematic analysis to extract meaningful insights.",
    "Results": "The ability to collect dengue surveillance data and conduct ongoing analyses were contingent upon the availability of individuals possessing essential digital literacy and analytical skills, which were often in short supply. Furthermore, effective space-time early warning and precise data collection were hindered by the absence of user-friendly tools, efficient reporting systems, and complexities in data integration. Additionally, the study underscored the importance of the crucial role of community involvement and collaboration among organizations involved in integrated dengue surveillance, control and quantitative tool development.",
    "Conclusions": "This study employed a qualitative approach to gain a deeper understanding of the contextual intricacies surrounding the development and implementation of quantitative tools, which, despite their potential for strengthening public health policy decisions in dengue control, remain relatively unexplored in the Thai context. The findings yield valuable insights and recommendations for the development and utilization of quantitative tools to support dengue control in Thailand. This information also has the potential to support use of such tools to exert impact beyond dengue to a broader spectrum of diseases."
