Within a mosquito population it is generally only the very old mosquitoes that are capable of spreading disease-causing pathogens, like dengue virus. Scientists have been developing fast, accurate, and cheap methods to estimate mosquito age. In this study, we used one of those methods to measure the activity of age-responsive genes in dengue virus-transmitting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from the Florida Keys, a dengue hotspot in the United States. This method allowed us to estimate the percentage of older mosquitoes in this region. We found that a high percentage of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in Key Largo, Marathon, and Key West (between 11–32%) were likely old enough to be able to spread dengue virus. We also observed that Ae. aegypti from the Florida Keys experienced relatively low daily mortality, as the daily probability of survival for any given mosquito was estimated at 86–88%. These findings suggest that conditions in the Florida Keys are very suitable for mosquitoes to thrive, reach old age, and potentially contribute to dengue outbreaks in the region.
