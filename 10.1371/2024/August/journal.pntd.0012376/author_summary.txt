Dengue is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Outbreaks of dengue occur in many tropical and subtropical countries and can place a big strain on health care services. In Sri Lanka, dengue occurs throughout the year, with outbreaks every few years. In 2017, Sri Lanka experienced a large dengue outbreak caused by dengue virus serotype 2. By chance, a clinical trial of a dengue vaccine (TAK-003) was taking place at the same time, which allowed us to look at how well the vaccine could work to control an outbreak. Because all trial sites were in a small region of Sri Lanka, we used a model to look at the vaccine’s potential impact over a wider area. Data from the clinical trial showed that the vaccine lowered the risk of symptomatic dengue infection and the risk of hospitalization owing to dengue. In addition, using epidemiological data from Sri Lanka at the time of the outbreak, the model showed that vaccination would be linked to a reduction in dengue cases and related hospitalizations compared with no vaccination, and would “flatten the curve” of the outbreak. Overall, our study shows that TAK-003 could be useful in controlling a dengue outbreak.
