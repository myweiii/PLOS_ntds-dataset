Vaccines that use attenuated viruses are highly effective in terms of providing protection, duration, breadth, and quality of the immune response. However, they may pose a risk to immunosuppressed individuals or in certain situations, such as during pregnancy. It is therefore important to analyze the residual virulence of attenuated vaccines to ensure their safety. In this work, we analysed the safety of the RVF virus vaccine variant 40Fp8 developed in our laboratory. We studied its effect on immunodeficient mice and used a more aggressive route of administration such as the intranasal delivery route. To assess the degree of attenuation of 40Fp8, we compared it with other attenuated prototype RVF vaccines. The results clearly demonstrate that 40Fp8 is highly attenuated, and its residual virulence level is extremely low compared to other vaccine viruses tested.
