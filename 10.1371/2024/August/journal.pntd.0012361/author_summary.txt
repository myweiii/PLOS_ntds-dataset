Dengue is a significant public health issue in the Urabá, this region reported around 40% of morbidity and mortality for the disease in the department of Antioquia (Colombia) in 2018. Clinical Practice Guidelines are tools intended for medical personnel to bridge the gap between proven intervention efficacy and clinical decision-making. A study was conducted s to identify determinants affecting adherence to the Comprehensive Clinical Care Guide for Patients with Dengue. Focus groups, questionnaires, and interviews were used. Participants included general practitioners, other health professionals, researchers, academics, and administrators. The barrier most frequently identified by participants was organizational change capacity, however individual health professionals also identified a lack of interest in self-learning and knowledge of the guidelines. On the other hand, among facilitators, they identified the guideline’s inherent characteristics. Although barriers outweighed facilitators for GACIPD adherence, determinants for its use were generally positive, as most participants reported it as being a complete, documented, and easy-to-implement guide. The lack of interest in self-learning and knowledge of the guidelines was identified as a potentially modifiable barrier and educational strategies could be implemented to overcome it.
