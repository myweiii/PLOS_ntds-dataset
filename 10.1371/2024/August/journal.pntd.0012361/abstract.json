    "Introduction": "Dengue is a significant public health issue in the Urab\u00e1 region, accounting for 37.5% of morbidity and 41.7% of mortality resulting from dengue in the department of Antioquia (Colombia) in 2018. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are tools based on Evidence-Based Medicine, intended for medical personnel to bridge the gap between proven intervention efficacy and clinical decision-making. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators in the implementation of CPGs for dengue patient care by healthcare officials in the municipalities of the banana axis in the Urab\u00e1 region.",
    "Methodology": "From a multifaceted approach to implementation research, a mixed method study that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches, was conducted during the years 2020 and 2021, using combined instruments to identify determinants (Guide Indicative Factors, Individual factors of health professionals, Patient factors, Professional interactions, Incentives and resources, Capacity for organizational change, and lastly Social, political, and legal factors) affecting adherence to the Comprehensive Clinical Care Guide for Patients with Dengue (GACIPD). Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with healthcare workers were conducted to assess determinants based on clinical experience. Questionnaires on determinants of GACIPD adherence, using an adapted version of the Chronic Disease Implementation Checklist (TICD), were also employed. Qualitative analysis of the interviews and focus groups used a concept-based coding framework. The questionnaire responses were analyzed using Likert scaling and frequency counts of determinants within and across domains. Participants included general practitioners, other health professionals, researchers, academics, and administrators.",
    "Results": "There was a total of 103 participants in focus groups, 7 in semi-structured interviews, and 136 participants through questionnaires. Among the domains studied, the identification of barriers and facilitators emphasized institutional factors and individual factors. Organizational change capacity was identified as a major barrier, with only 3.6% of respondents indicating that their institution adjusted the prioritization of adequate care according to the guideline. The GACIPD domain received the highest facilitator rating, with 66.7% acceptance due to its practicality, simplicity, clarity, documentation, and ease of implementation, despite this, only 10% of professionals completely agree that their work is in accordance with the GACIPD. The determinant of patient factors was significant in the negative perception of adherence to GACIPD.",
    "Conclusions": "Although barriers outweighed facilitators for GACIPD adherence, determinants for its use were generally positive, as most participants reported it as being a complete, documented, and easy-to-implement guide. The lack of knowledge of the guidelines impacting health professional\u2019s decision making was identified as a potentially modifiable barrier, and educational strategies could be implemented to overcome it. The region requires greater emphasis on the management of chronic health conditions, comorbidities, and coinfections of dengue with other endemic diseases."
