Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and its serious complication rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are key markers of social injustice. In Victoria, Australia, ARF and RHD became notifiable in mid-2022. This change was instigated in response to recent work showing an ongoing burden of disease in young Victorians, particularly people of Pacific Islander (‘Pacific’) ethnicities.
Until recently, nothing has been documented of the experiences that patients and their families have had when seeking clinical care for ARF/RHD in Victoria. We undertook this qualitative study to address this knowledge gap. Our study was co-designed by a project reference group which included local Pacific people. We used traditional Pacific ‘talanoa’ conversational style interviews to report on patients’ and their caregivers’ experiences of receiving clinical care.
Our findings provide critical guidance for best practice public health management in areas such as Victoria with a low but severely ethnically inequitable disease burden. We make recommendations to support clinicians in areas with at-risk populations to enhance their awareness of ARF and RHD, and improve the delivery of clinical care. Our recommendations provide direction for future initiatives to prevent and control these serious health conditions, and better support affected people.
