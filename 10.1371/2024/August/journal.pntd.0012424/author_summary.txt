The most common malaria in Malaysia is caused by animal-to-human transmission of Plasmodium knowlesi from its natural monkey hosts to humans via mosquito bites. As the human immune system responds to such infection, white blood cells such as neutrophils are recruited, activated and release products with pathogen-killing activity. There is increasing evidence that neutrophil products cause damage to the host and contribute to severe disease. While this has been studied in human-only malaria, the role of neutrophils in zoonotic P. knowlesi malaria is poorly understood. In this study, we examined three markers of neutrophil activation (neutrophil elastase, citrullinated histone H3 and neutrophil extracellular traps) in hospital patients with severe and non-severe knowlesi malaria from Sabah, East Malaysia. Compared to healthy controls, neutrophil activation was increased in patients with knowlesi malaria in proportion to disease severity. The increase in neutrophil activation was also linked to different types of severe malaria manifestations, especially acute lung injury. These findings have implications for development of new strategies to prevent host organ damage for better treatment of severe knowlesi malaria.
