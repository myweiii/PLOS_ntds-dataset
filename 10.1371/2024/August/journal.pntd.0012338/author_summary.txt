Buruli ulcer (BU) is a severe bacterial skin disease. Molecular diagnostic methods, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), require a well-equipped laboratory with reliable electricity supply, which is challenging in low-resource settings. We aimed to evaluate a protocol for loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), independent of power supply, as an alternative DNA-detection based diagnostic tool for peripheral health care facilities at the point-of-care (PoC). Our protocol included a rapid syringe-based DNA extraction method, followed by a LAMP assay using a commercial pocket warmer for incubation. It showed promising results, with around 84% sensitivity and 100% specificity, as compared to standard molecular methods. Through interviews and discussions with researchers, healthcare workers and community members, we characterized the diagnostic and treatment workflow at a potential target site in an endemic area in Ghanaâ€™s Eastern Region. Reported barriers to treatment seeking included perceptions of BU and price and availability of transport, and confirmed potential advantages of diagnosis at the PoC in preventing delays and loss to follow-up. Our study suggests that this LAMP protocol could hold promise for rapid and accurate diagnosis of BU in settings with unreliable electricity; further research will need to include further optimization and evaluation.
