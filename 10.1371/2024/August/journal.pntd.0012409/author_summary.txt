Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by species of the Leishmania parasite. It causes skin lesions that can be categorised into three main clinical presentations: i) localised cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL), with one or several ulcerated lesions; ii) mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) that affects the mucosa of the nose or the mouth; iii) disseminated CL (DCL), that is characterised by widespread nodules. While LCL usually heals spontaneously, MCL and DCL require treatment; and patients often experience relapses. CL leaves disfiguring scars, that can result in societal stigmatisation.
In this study, we recruited a cohort of CL patients in a newly established leishmaniasis treatment centre (LTC) in Lay Gayint, Northwest Ethiopia, and collected detailed demographic and clinical data. We found that most CL patients presented with LCL, followed by MCL, and that more males than females present to the LTC. The duration of illness varied from 1 to 180 months. Over a third of CL patients had additional suspected CL cases in their home. Despite most patients having heard about CL, only a minority knew about its transmission or that it could be treated. This work emphasises that CL is an important public health problem in this area of Ethiopia.
