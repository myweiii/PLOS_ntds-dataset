This study conducted a genetic analysis of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the bacterium causing a deadly tropical disease, from 156 patients in southern Thailand during 2014–2020. It found various genotypes, some of which were consistent with the genotypes found in the environment dating back to the 1960s. Extensive testing of soil and water in the region revealed contamination with B. pseudomallei. Areas such as animal farms, mountains, grasslands, and natural water sources e.g., streams and waterfalls, were mostly affected. This finding confirmed that some B. pseudomallei genotypes have had a long-standing presence in the environment, contributing to recent human cases. This study not only enhance our understanding of the spread of melioidosis throughout Southeast Asia but also highlights the importance of ongoing research and monitoring of B. pseudomallei in natural environments to address potential risks associated with the bacterium’s persistence.
