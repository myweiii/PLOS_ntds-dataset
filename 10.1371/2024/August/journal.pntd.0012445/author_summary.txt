Opisthorchis-like egg infections are highly prevalent in northern and northeastern Thailand; however, their genetic epidemiology and structure in northern Thailand are unknown. Thus, this study examined the genetic structure of Opisthorchis-like eggs in the hill tribe population of Chiang Mai Province, northern Thailand, using mitochondrial genes [cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1)]. A total of 205 positive fecal samples for Opisthorchis-like eggs were collected and examined using internal transcribed spacer 2 polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. Thirty fecal samples of O. viverrini and Haplorchis taichui were randomly selected for investigating population genetic structure using cox1 and nad1. Pairwise FST analysis demonstrated nonsignificant genetic differentiation within the intrapopulation of Chiang Mai Province and interpopulations from different geographic areas. Gene flow estimation showed that cox1 had higher gene flow than nad1 in O. viverrini, whereas both genes showed low gene flow in H. taichui. Moreover, neutrality tests and haplotype networks revealed a population expansion from the bottleneck or selective sweep. Additionally, the phylogenetic trees of O. viverrini and H. taichui revealed monophyletic groups and were genetically similar to isolates in other regions in Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam.
