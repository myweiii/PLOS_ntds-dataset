American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) is one of the major neglected diseases occurring in Brazil and the Amazon contributes with a wide range of species that are not completely known. These little-known species are transmitted to rural workers entering the forest during lumbering, mining, and latex extraction activities and rarely in peri domestic situation. Infection occurs by the bite of infected sand flies in different environments and biomes. One of the major constraints in studying L. (Viannia) species is the difficulty of finding suitable animal and cellular models to investigate their biology. The mouse model is not a suitable model for most L. (Viannia) species. However, hamsters were considered a good model for L. (V.) braziliensis. In the search for a better model for some neglected dermotropic Amazonian Leishmania, we evaluated interactions in vivo in the hamster and in vitro in its macrophages. All species infected cells in vitro, but hamsters could only be considered as a suitable in vivo model for L. (V.) guyanensis. Importantly the glycoconjugates of the six L. (Viannia) species were very proinflammatory, showing various levels of macrophage activation. This paper opens possibilities of determining more accurately the taxonomic position of L. (V.) lainsoni within the subgenus L. (Viannia).
