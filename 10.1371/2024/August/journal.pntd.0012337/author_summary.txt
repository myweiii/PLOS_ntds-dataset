In Europe, HTLV-1 infections mainly originate in regions such as the West Indies, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. However, Romania has been identified as a true endemic area, due to reported cases of ATL among Romanian patients. To understand this situation, we analyzed the genetic diversity of HTLV-1 in Romanians and collected DNA from 11 infected individuals, most of them ATL cases. The results showed a close genetic relationship between most of the sequences, closely matching the previously identified Romanian RKI2 strain. However, one strain, ROU7, showed a slight divergence. Phylogenetic analysis positioned these sequences in the cosmopolitan HTLV-1a genotype, belonging mainly to the a-TC Mozambique-Southern Africa subgroup. This suggests a probable origin of HTLV-1 in Romania from South Africa, perhaps recently introduced. Further studies aim to elucidate the transmission routes and emergence of this HTLV-1 endemicity in Central Europe.
