    "Background": "A significant portion of South Korea\u2019s population, approximately a quarter, owns pets, with dogs being the most popular choice among them. However, studies analyzing the fecal organism communities of dogs in South Korea are lacking, and limited efforts have been exerted to identify pathogens with potential zoonotic implications. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate potential pathogens using metabarcoding analysis and evaluate the risk of zoonotic diseases in dog feces in Seoul, South Korea.",
    "Methodology": "Fecal samples were collected from both pet and stray dogs in the Mapo district of Seoul. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was utilized, employing 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify prokaryotic pathogens, and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing for eukaryotic pathogens. The data obtained from the QIIME2 pipeline were subjected to various statistical analyses to identify different putative pathogens and their compositions.",
    "Principal findings": "Significant variations in microbiota composition were found between stray and pet dogs, and putative prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens were identified. The most prevalent putative bacterial pathogens were Fusobacterium, Helicobacter, and Campylobacter. The most prevalent putative eukaryotic pathogens were Giardia, Pentatrichomonas, and Cystoisospora. Interestingly, Campylobacter, Giardia, and Pentatrichomonas were found to be significantly more prevalent in stray dogs than in pet dogs. The variation in the prevalence of potential pathogens in dog feces could be attributed to environmental factors, including dietary variances and interactions with wildlife, particularly in stray dogs. These factors likely contributed to the observed differences in pathogen occurrence between stray and pet dogs.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "This study offers valuable insights into the zoonotic risks associated with dog populations residing in diverse environments. By identifying and characterizing putative pathogens in dog feces, this research provides essential information on the impact of habitat on dog-associated pathogens, highlighting the importance of public health planning and zoonotic risk management."
