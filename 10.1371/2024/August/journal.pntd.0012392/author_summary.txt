Q fever and Rift Valley fever are two diseases that can affect both humans and animals, causing illness and death. These two diseases can cause large-scale outbreaks, not only affecting the health of individuals and communities but also resulting in a substantial economic loss at the individual, community, regional and national levels through losses in livestock products. We conducted a sero-epidemiological study in the Afar region of north-eastern Ethiopia to determine the presence of these two diseases in nomadic pastoralists and their livestock. Our results indicate that 25.0% of the pastoralists and 34.3% of their animals have had previous exposure to Q fever and 6.1% of the pastoralists and 3.9% of their animals have been exposed to Rift Valley fever. Goats appear to be the most common livestock species associated with Q fever in this region, while cattle are the most common species associated with Rift Valley fever. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous surveillance; additionally, we would recommend the development of rapid response plans for potential outbreaks that integrate the human and animal health sectors.
