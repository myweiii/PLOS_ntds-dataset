A recent study in migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa with eosinophilia related to helminth infection describes initial findings on cardiac ultrasound in the form of thickening of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, but with no clinical manifestations, representing the early stage of the endomyocardial fibrosis process. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the relationship between eosinophilia secondary to helminth infection and cardiac involvement in Latin American patients. In our cohort, eosinophilia in patients was mainly due to Strongyloides stercoralis infection. Among patients with eosinophilia, echocardiographic findings revealed a greater right ventricle thickness and left atrial area and volume index, while showing a lower left atrial strain and E-wave deceleration time when compared with patients without eosinophilia. These alterations are suggestive of early diastolic dysfunction that could be related to eosinophilia-induced changes in the endomyocardium.
