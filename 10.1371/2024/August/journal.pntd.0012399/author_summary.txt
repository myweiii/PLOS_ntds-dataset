This study aimed to identify easy-to-use indicators for face washing behaviour to improve the evaluation of behaviour change interventions in the context of trachoma elimination. The study compared reported behaviour, script-based pictorial recall (a routine-based diary activity to covertly capture information on face washing behaviour) and facial cleanliness indicators with direct observation of face washing. Facial cleanliness assessment and qPHAT scores were poorly correlated with observed behaviour. Caution should be applied before using facial cleanliness metrics as a proxy for face washing. Survey report produced much higher estimates of face washing and face washing with soap than were observed. Pictorial recall overestimated face washing with soap in the intervention arm following intervention exposure, suggesting the metric reflects knowledge rather than behaviour. None of the tested alternatives to structured observation can be recommended to monitor the effectiveness of face washing interventions in community settings.
