Moxidectin is approved to treat onchocerciasis or “river-blindness”. For years, mass drug administration programs (MDA) involving at least annual treatment of entire populations within a geographical area have been used as a strategy to control onchocerciasis. The potential treatment population therefore includes pregnant and breast-feeding women. Guidance on the safe and effective use of medicines in these populations is needed but is often insufficient. In this study, we describe two methods to determine the amount of moxidectin administered to breastfeeding infants via breastmilk. Both methods used data from a clinical study in which moxidectin levels were measured in the blood and breast milk of lactating women. In an empirical analysis, the amount of moxidectin in a breast-fed infant was inferred based on observed blood and breast milk levels in the clinical study. Using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model approach, which considers all prior information on the drug and the physiological variability involved, direct assessments of the amount of drug in the infant were estimated. Both methods established the likely time-course and level of moxidectin exposure in infants via breast milk, highlighting the benefit of an integrated approach to generate dosing recommendations supporting the use of moxidectin in breastfeeding women.
