Fasciola hepatica is a parasitic worm causing fasciolosis, primarily affecting herbivorous mammals and posing a significant veterinary problem. Furthermore, it is a zoonosis, meaning it can be transmitted to humans. F. hepatica enters the definitive host through ingestion of contaminated aquatic plants, migrating through the intestine to settle in the liver bile ducts, where it matures into the adult stage. To migrate, it utilizes various invasion strategies, including the use of multifunctional proteins, known as ‘moonlighting’. In this study, we produced and molecularly characterized the parasitic enzyme enolase as a moonlighting protein to understand F. hepatica invasion mechanisms. We produced recombinant enolase with glycolytic activity, its canonical function in parasite energy production. Additionally, we localised this enzyme in the parasite’s tegument, in direct contact with the host, and studied its ability to elicit an immune response early in ovine infection. Finally, we demonstrated the ability of enolase to interact with the extracellular matrix and the host’s fibrinolysis, a proteolytic system responsible for dissolving blood clots. These secondary functions of F. hepatica enolase, described here for the first time, along with its localisation, suggest this protein as an interesting antigen for fasciolosis control.
