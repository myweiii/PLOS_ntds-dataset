Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME) is a bacterial disease caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis which is transmitted by tick bites and exclusively reported from Northern America. Infections with other Ehrlichia bacteria are rare, and only very rarely are such cases reported from outside North America. Most cases of HME are likely to be asymptomatic, and symptomatic cases of HME can be easily overlooked or confused as they present primarily as a non-specific febrile illness. Patients with a weakened immune system (e.g. organ transplant patients) are more susceptible to HME and show more complications when compared to patients with a normal immune system. Although response to antimicrobial treatment is usually fast and effective, complications may arise (particularly in patients with a weakened immune system) and the outcome even be fatal. Since most available data on HME comes from case reports, case series and retrospective studies, data on several aspects of the disease remains patchy. To obtain a better overview on various aspect of HME we systematically reviewed the existing literature and compiled and analyzed the reported data on epidemiology, clinical presentation, complications, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of HME.
