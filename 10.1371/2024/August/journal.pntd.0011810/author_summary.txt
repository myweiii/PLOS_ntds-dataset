We examined U.S. Military Health System (MHS) healthcare delivery data to identify the likelihood of rheumatic complications after chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. Overall, CHIKV infections were rare in the MHS, with 195 cases found in the records between 2014 and 2018 (a period which encompassed the peak of the CHIKV epidemic in the Americas). Of these, about 32% received a rheumatic diagnosis after infection, including arthralgia, polyarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who had a rheumatic diagnosis had on average 7 healthcare encounters for their post-CHIKV rheumatic complication, and a quarter had more than 15 healthcare encounters. We did not find any demographic, clinical, or occupational characteristics associated with developing rheumatic complications after CHIKV, suggesting that predicting rheumatic complications from CHIKV may be challenging in MHS beneficiaries. These findings may provide important context for decisions about implementing an approved chikungunya vaccine to military servicemembers and other MHS beneficiaries.
