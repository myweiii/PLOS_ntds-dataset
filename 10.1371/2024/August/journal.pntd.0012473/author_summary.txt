Parasitic filarial nematodes cause serious illnesses in humans and canines including limb deformities and disfigurement, blindness, heart failure, and death, among others. There are no vaccines, and current drugs in use against filarial nematodes infections have only modest effects and are prone to complications. In this study, we explored a unique enzyme (DiMT), conserved in all parasitic filarial nematodes but not in mammalian species. Using computation, biochemistry and molecular biology approaches, we validated DiMT as a catechol-O-methyltransferase that functions to inactivate catecholamines to prevent their accumulation and hence block their deleterious effects in filarial nematodes, including loss of worm viability, reproduction and survival. Subsequently, we identified DiMTâ€™s chemical inhibitors and demonstrated that they possess anti-filarial nematode efficacy through blocking the inactivation of catecholamines. Together, we have unveiled DiMT as a viable molecular target for the development of new drugs for treating filarial nematode infections.
