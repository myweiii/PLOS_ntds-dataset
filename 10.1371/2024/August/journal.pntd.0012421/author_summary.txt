Toxoplasma gondii is an extremely widespread and a worldwide health problem protozoon, which can induce acute and chronic infection and cause severe toxoplasmosis. However, there is still no effective vaccine to prevent infection, drugs used to treat the acute infected individuals have a lot of limitations, and no drugs to treat chronic infected individuals. Indirect ELISA, as a commonly used clinical test with satisfactory detection performance and easy implementation for high throughput testing, has been used to detect various pathogenic microorganisms. Immune mapped protein1 (IMP1) has been identified as a protein that induces a strong immune response in the host. In this study, we obtained IMP1 protein with high purity and used it as coated antigen to prepare an indirect ELISA reagent, and then verified its detection performance (sensitivity, specificity, repeatability). This study enriches the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis and provides strong technical support for epidemiological investigation and transmission control of toxoplasmosis.
