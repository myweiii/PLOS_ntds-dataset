    "Abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is widely spread around the world, which can cause serious harm to immunosuppressed patients. Currently, the commercial test kits are poor at assessing T. gondii infection and vaccine effectiveness, making an urgent need to exploit effective enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with great performance to compensate for this deficiency. Here, the TgIMP1 recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL(21) cells. The TgIMP1 was purified with affinity chromatography and the reactivity was retained with anti-TgIMP1 antibodies. The TgIMP1 was then used to develop an indirect ELISA (IMP1-iELISA) and the reaction conditions of IMP1-iELISA were optimized. As a result, the cut-off value was determined to be 0.2833 by analyzing the OD450nm values of forty T. gondii-negative sera. The coefficient of variation of 6 T. gondii-positive sera within and between runs were both less than 10%. The IMP1-iELISA was non-cross-reactive with the sera of cytomegalovirus, herpes virus, rubella virus, Cryptosporidium spp., Theileria spp., Neospora spp. and Plasmodium spp.. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of IMP1-iELISA were 98.9% and 96.7%, respectively, based on testing 150 serum samples. The results suggest that this IMP1-iELISA is specific, sensitive, repeatable and can be applied to the detection of T. gondii infections in the medical and health industries."
