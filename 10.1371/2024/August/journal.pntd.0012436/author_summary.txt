The skin is a reservoir for African trypanosomes. Here, we conducted a prospective study in Forecariah and Boffa, Guinea, to estimate the proportion of skin-dwelling parasites in the population. Of the 18,916 subjects screened for HAT, 96 were enrolled into our study. Participants underwent a dermatological examination and had blood samples and superficial skin biopsies taken for examination by molecular and immuno-histological methods. In individuals seropositive for HAT, dermatological symptoms were significantly more frequent. Trypanosome DNA was detected in the blood of 67% of confirmed cases and 9% of unconfirmed seropositive individuals. However, parasites were detected in the skin of up to 71% of confirmed cases and 41% of unconfirmed seropositive individuals. After treatment, trypanosome detection in the skin dropped to 17% of confirmed cases, whereas up to 25% of unconfirmed, hence untreated, seropositive individuals were still found positive. Dermal trypanosomes were observed in subjects from both regions; however, the occurrence of itching and the PCR positivity were significantly higher in unconfirmed seropositive individuals in Forecariah. The lower sensitivity of superficial skin biopsies appeared critical for detecting trypanosomes. These results are discussed in the context of the planned elimination of HAT.
