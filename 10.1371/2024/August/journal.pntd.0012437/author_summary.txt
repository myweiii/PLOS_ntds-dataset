Hantavirus is an important pathogen that can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). HFRS has long been a serious public health problem in Yunnan Province. However, the molecular epidemiology and host characteristics of hantavirus in Yunnan Province are still unclear. Therefore, we screened hantaviruses in bats and rodents in selected areas of Yunnan from 2018 to 2022 and found the 10th SEOV lineage in rodents, as well as new geographic clusters of Xuan son virus (XSV) and novel hantavirus in bats. We proposed the possibility of the 10th SEOV lineage in rodents as an ancestral lineage and explained the related host-switching events in bat hantaviruses. These results provide data to reveal a greater risk of zoonotic disease and support the prevention and control of hantavirus-associated diseases and in Yunnan Province.
