Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection is a major challenge for the control of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), particularly in Ethiopia where both frequently occur. VL-HIV disease is often hard to treat, and some treated patients will relapse after initially thought to be cured. However, there is a long period of asymptomatic Leishmania infection prior to the development of VL-HIV symptoms, and tackling the infection at this stage will be valuable in the effort to combat VL-HIV disease. However, this requires good understanding of human risk factors for VL development. In this work, we tested the Human Leukocyte Antigen gene region and the association with VL disease development, as genetic risk factors. We identified a preliminary association between the HLA-A*03:01 gene variant and an increased risk for VL development. This would need to be tested again in a larger study, to assess whether it can be used to see if asymptomatic Leishmania-infected individuals will develop VL disease.
