Numerous previous studies have measured all of the mRNA in Brugia malayi under a variety of conditions. Here, we collectively analyzed all data from those previous studies to gain new insights, which can be facilitated by the additional comparisons of this type of meta-analysis. Importantly, this meta-analysis demonstrates that worms that are shipped to various locations and handled by different laboratories are largely the same. The exception are adult females, where two profiles are apparent that are vastly different, which could lead to differing results in laboratory experiments. We propose that shipping dates and conditions be provided in manuscripts and that a transcriptome profile be collected in future laboratory studies to benchmark worms. In addition, the inclusion of more worm samples reveals that differences between worm shipments and batches is greater than the difference observed upon treatment with anthelminthic agents (ivermectin, albendazole, and DEC) under the conditions examined in the original studies. During this work, we identified some regions of the genome where genes were misidentified that affect RNA-based analysis and provide an updated annotation file to facilitate their removal in future studies.
