Chagas Disease (CD), a neglected tropical disease (NTD), is a global public health issue with an estimated 70 million people being at risk of infection. Congenital transmission is currently the main mode of transmission of T. cruzi in both endemic and non-endemic countries. Most women of gestational age in endemic countries are chronically infected, having acquired the infection during infancy. Vertical transmission happens in 5% of them, and thus approximately 9,000 newborns infected with CD in Latin America are born annually. The available data on preventive treatments for pregnant women and the rate of congenital transmission is still limited with existing epidemiological information predominantly based on estimations. Therefore, our meta-analysis confirms the evidence for the use of trypanocidal agents in infected women of reproductive age to prevent congenital Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) infection.
