Ascaris lumbricoides, a common parasitic worm, may modulate the immune system in different ways. While much is known about the IgE antibody response to this parasite, the cellular immune responses remain less understood. Our research question in this study was how A. lumbricoides infection influences B cell responses, with a focus on regulatory B cells (Bregs).
We conducted our research in a rural town in the North Coast of Colombia, an area where soil-transmitted helminth infections are prevalent. We compared blood samples from 18 individuals infected with A. lumbricoides and 11 non-infected individuals to analyze Breg cells, related cytokines, and specific antibodies against the parasiteâ€™s excretory/secretory product, ABA-1. We observed that individuals infected with A. lumbricoides have higher frequencies of Breg cells, especially those with a more intense infection (higher counts of parasite eggs in feces). In particular, certain subsets of Breg cells were significantly elevated in those with higher parasite loads. Interestingly, infection was also linked to reduced levels of antibodies specific to ABA-1. Notably, the frequency of IL-10+ Breg cells was inversely related to the levels of ABA-1-specific IgE.
In conclusion, A. lumbricoides infection may induce immunosuppressive responses, marked by an increase in regulatory B cells and a decrease in specific antibody responses. These findings highlight the intricate ways in which this parasite modulates the immune system, which could have implications for understanding immune regulation in parasitic infections.
