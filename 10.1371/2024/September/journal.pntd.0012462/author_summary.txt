Schistosomiasis is a devastating tropical and sub-tropical disease that disproportionately infects those in resource-limited settings, which causes death, morbidity and socioeconomic impact. The disease is caused by blood parasites under the genus Schistosoma. Tanzania is one of the schistosomiasis burdened countries in the sub-Saharan region. Praziquantel mass drug administration has been a predominant schistosomiasis control strategy in the country. We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using a prevalence dataset from published literature, aiming at assessing the country’s schistosomiasis burden (prevalence) following several years of disease control. We further conducted a subgroup analysis to assess the contributing factors to the observed disease prevalence. The obtained information provides insight into the impact of schistosomiasis control in Tanzania, and highlights the potential for positive change and improvement in the country’s fight against this disease.
