    "Introduction": "The African continent harbors a diverse array of infectious diseases with profound impacts on public health, economic development, and general well-being [1,2]. Diseases caused by arthropod-borne viruses, collectively known as arboviruses, are a growing threat for Africa and the rest of the world especially in relation to climate and environmental changes [3,4]. Arboviruses are a polyphyletic clade that includes several viral families, of which the most important are Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Reoviridae [5]. Some well-known arboviruses, notorious for their negative effects on human health, are dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus. Mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies, and midges are the primary vectors responsible for arbovirus transmission as they engage in hematophagy. These vectors do not only affect humans and livestock, but also a wide range of wildlife hosts [6\u20138]. Indeed, while for some arboviruses morbidity and mortality can be high in humans, similar impacts have been detected in other animals by arboviruses such as Rift Valley Fever virus in goats and sheep, West Nile virus in birds and horses, and Japanese Encephalitis virus in birds and pigs [4,5,9\u201311]. The (re-)emergence of arboviruses is linked to increased urbanization and global connectivity, natural genetic evolution of viruses, and adaptations of the vectors to changing climate and environments [11,12]. Emerging arboviruses pose a threat for humans, livestock, as well as wildlife, therefore it needs to be approached from a One health perspective (i.e., including human, animal, and environmental health) [13,14]. Nevertheless, our knowledge about the extent to which wild animals can serve as sylvatic hosts for human-infecting arboviruses and the natural diversity of arboviruses remains insufficient. This significantly limits our understanding of arbovirus transmission dynamics, which is required to develop more effective control measurements.\nFor decades, efforts have been made to identify natural reservoirs of arboviruses to monitor, prevent, and control sources of infection that pose a threat to human health [15\u201317]. Several studies have proposed non-human primates as significant potential reservoirs for arboviruses, as they have found arbovirus antibodies and viral RNA in this animal group [18\u201320]. However, other animal groups such as small mammals have often been neglected as potential arbovirus hosts [21]. Sporadic reports of arboviruses in small mammal species suggest that a more comprehensive investigation of their potential role as a host is needed [22\u201324].\nRodents have a number of characteristics that could make them an important hosts for several pathogens, including arboviruses [23]. Particularly the high species diversity, the fact that many species can reach high population abundances, and turnover rates. The risk of pathogen spillover to humans increases with the role of some rodents as a pest species, due to their proximity to humans [25,26]. A notable example of such a pest species is the ubiquitous rodent Mastomys natalensis, commonly known as the multimammate mouse. This species inhabits many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, with a preference for crop fields, fallow land, and typically occurring within or at the fringes of urban settlements [27,28]. In east Africa, especially in Tanzania, the reproductive cycle of M. natalensis is strongly correlated with seasonal rainfall which leads to strong seasonal fluctuations in density (20\u2013500 individuals/hectare) and occasionally even severe population outbreaks (>1000 individuals/hectare) [29\u201332]. This has large ecological and societal impacts due to crop damage and influences seasonal transmission dynamics of different pathogens [33\u201335]. The multimammate mouse is a known host for several zoonotic pathogens such as Lassa mammarenavirus, Yersinia pestis, Leptospira interrogans, Leishmania major as well as different ecto- and endoparasites [31,36\u201352]. No studies have investigated or reported on arboviruses in M. natalensis, except Diagne et al. (2019) who have detected Usutu virus RNA in M. natalensis. However, other studies have reported on sporadic arbovirus detections in other rodent species in sub-Saharan Africa [22,24,53,54]. These findings, along with the ecology of M. natalensis (i.e., high abundance during population outbreaks, proximity to humans, and its status as a proven pathogen host) may suggest that this species plays a role in the natural transmission cycle of arboviruses. Consequently, M. natalensis could thus pose a risk to humans in east Africa, particularly in Tanzania as an amplifying host.\nThe human population in Tanzania has experienced several outbreaks of chikungunya virus, Rift Valley fever virus, West Nile virus, and dengue virus in the past decades [55\u201359]. Due to the symptomatic similarities between arbovirus and malaria infections, which has a prevalence of around 20% in Tanzania, it is probable that arbovirus cases are underreported [60,61]. While these studies confirm that the local human population is indeed exposed to arboviruses, the specific dynamics of arbovirus transmission in this region remains unclear.\nThe goal of this study was to investigate the potential of wild M. natalensis to serve as a host for arboviruses in their natural environment. To achieve this, we first developed a multiplex immune assay to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against 15 different arboviruses and subsequently conducted a comprehensive screening of almost 1,300 blood samples obtained from M. natalensis from Morogoro, Tanzania.",
    "Materials and methods": "Ethics statement\nThe Ethical Committee for Animal Testing at the University of Antwerp approved the animal experiments performed in this study (ECD2021-79 and ECD2023-08).\n\n\nSample origin\nThe samples used in this study were collected during previous published and unpublished studies conducted by the University of Antwerp and Pest Management Center of the Sokoine University of Agriculture on M. natalensis in Morogoro, Tanzania, between 2010 and 2019 [31,62,63] (Fig 1). The samples were divided in two screening sessions. The first session consisted of approximately 500 dried blood spot (DBS) samples, from wild captured mice that were used in infection and behavioral experiments in six different years (i.e., 2010, 2011, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019) with an average of 80 samples per year. The second session consisted of 800 DBS samples from mice involved in capture-mark-recapture experiments in 2017 and 2019. All samples were randomly selected from the studies regardless of individual characteristics or trapping period.\nSamples were collected in the city of Morogoro (red triangle) which is located in the Morogoro region. Basemap origins: https://d-maps.com/carte.php?num_car=736&lang=en and https://d-maps.com/carte.php?num_car=4976&lang=en.\nDuring these studies, M. natalensis were live caught using Sherman traps (H.B. Sherman Traps, Tallahassee, USA) in a heterogeneous landscape (e.g., woodlands, maize fields, and fallow land) on the premises of the Sokoine University of Agriculture in Morogoro, Tanzania. Blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus using a 50\u03bcL hematocrit capillary tube and preserved on filter paper (Serobuvard; LDA 22; Zoopole, France). The filter paper was dried for 12 hours at room temperature and archived at -20\u00b0C in envelopes with desiccant. Additional data related to characteristics such as sex, reproductive status, weight, and body measurements were recorded. More detailed Information pertaining to the trapping procedures and sampling methodology can be found in the primary research documents associated with these studies [31,62\u201364].\n\n\nAnalysis and protocol\nAssay set up.To assess the presence of arbovirus antibodies in DBS against a panel of arboviruses, we first developed a multiplex immune assay using Luminex technology [18,65] (S1 File). Recombinant virus-derived proteins (Table 1) were covalently coupled to carboxyl-functionalized fluorescent magnetic beads (1\u20133\u03bcg/1.25*10^6 beads) (Luminex Corp. MagPlexMicrospheres; Bio-Rad; Temse, Belgium) employing the BioPlex amine coupling kit (Ref.: 171406001; Bio-Rad; Temse, Belgium) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nArbovirus protein inoculation.To obtain positive control samples we inoculated captive M. natalensis individuals (age: 5\u201312 months) from our breeding colony at the University of Antwerp with recombinant virus-derived proteins (Table 1) [66\u201368]. We subcutaneously injected 4\u03bcg of the respective virus protein and 1\u03bcL of vaccine adjuvant (Quil-A adjuvant; InvivoGen; Toulouse, France), dissolved in autoclaved phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to achieve a final volume of 1mL. This inoculum was evenly divided, with 0.5mL administered into the scruff and 0.5mL into the hindlimb of the animal, using a 25-gauge, 12.5mm needle and a 0.5mL syringe. This inoculation was duplicated for each viral protein (i.e., performed in two mice) and repeated twice for each mouse (i.e., inoculation on day 0 and day 20). We collected blood, according to the same method as in the previously mentioned studies, every 10 days from day zero until day 30, at day 30 we also collected whole blood from which serum was extracted. Serum from day 30 from individuals were the antibody response increased over time were considered as positive samples. Day 30 had the highest antibody titer in our tests and is also a time point at which IgG antibody development is anticipated to have reached a peak [69,70].\n\nArbovirus IgG antibody screening.Screening was done in 96 flat-bottom well plates, each plate contained DBS samples of 80 wild M. natalensis, two background controls, eight negative controls, and a six step dilution series (1:200\u20131:625,000) of a positive pool sample. Each well in the plate contained 50\u03bcL of the corresponding sample type. The samples of the wild M. natalensis were acquired by placing a punched-out DBS (round, 0.5 cm diameter) in 200 \u03bcL of dilution buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween-20, 5% fetal calf serum, 45% distilled water, 50% Hypertonic PBS {0.08% NaH2PO4, 0.25% Na2HPO4, 8.8% NaCl}). One single DBS punch corresponds to approximately 10\u03bcL of blood [71]. The punched DBS were left to elute overnight, in a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube, maintained at a temperature of 4\u00b0C on a plate shaker. This elution was considered a 1:100 dilution and was diluted, with dilution buffer, to 1:200 prior to loading in the 96 well plate. This dilution gave the best signal to noise ratio in our preliminary tests and are in line with previous studies [18,72]. The background control was reading buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% NaN3, 100% phosphate buffered saline). The eight negative controls were four DBS, treated the same as the wild M. natalensis DBS, and four serum samples in a 1:200 dilution. All negative controls originated from the breeding colony at the University of Antwerp. Serum from 15 positive individuals (i.e., one for each inoculated arbovirus antigen) was pooled to create the positive pool sample, each individual serum had a final dilution in the pool of 1:200.\nIn each well of the 96 well plate, 25\u03bcL of bead mixture was added. The bead mixture consisted out of ~1000 protein-coated beads per arbovirus antigen suspended in reading buffer. The bead mixture of the first screening session did not contain ONNV beads.\nPlates, containing 50\u03bcL of sample and 25\u03bcL of bead mixture per well, were incubated for one hour at room temperature, in the dark and on a plate shaker (Heidolph Titrimax 100; VWR; Leuven, Belgium) at 400rpm/min. After incubation, plates underwent washing with dilution buffer using an automated plate washer (Tecan Hydroflex plate washer; Tecan Benelux; Mechelen, Belgium). Subsequently, we added 50\u03bcL Biotin anti-mouse IgG (4\u03bcg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich B7022; Merck Life Science; Hoeilaart, Belgium) to each well and incubated for 40 minutes. After another round of washing, we added 50\u03bcL of Streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (1\u03bcg/mL) (10655783; Fisher Scientific; Brussel, Belgium) to each well, followed by a 10-minute incubation. The last wash step used reading buffer, and the final bead pellet was resuspended in 150\u03bcL of reading buffer. Beads were read on a Bio-Plex 200 System (Bio-Rad; Temse, Belgium). Results were quantified as the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) based on a minimum of 100 beads per antigen, MFI data can be found in S1 Table.\n\n\n\nData analysis and statistics\nAll data preparation, analysis and statistical procedures were conducted using R Statistical Software (R version 4.3.3) [73] (S2 File).\nWeight as age classification.We used the body weight of the wild-caught M. natalensis individuals at the time of sample collection as a rough proxy for age, which we subdivided into three categories based on the 1/3 quantiles of weight; juvenile (5\u201326.7g), subadult (>26.7\u201342g) and adult (>42\u201391g). These weight classes coincide to the expected sexual maturity, with sexual maturity estimated to occur between 30\u201340g [29,32].\n\nInter plate variation.To control for variation between different assay plates and testing days, the MFI results were transformed to relative antibody units using the positive dilution series as a standard curve. The MFI result of the positive control starting dilution (i.e., 1:200) was equalized to 3,125 units and each following dilution step was adjusted proportionally (i.e., the final dilution step 1:625,000 corresponded to 1 unit). The results of the two sessions were combined by linear alignment adjustment. This alignment was based on 86 duplicate samples encompassing the measurable range, allowing the adjustment of the results from the first session.\n\nSerostatus, cutoff and seroprevalence.Finally, each sample was categorized as a binary value (i.e., 1 = positive, 0 = negative) for each of the tested arboviruses. This was done based on whether the unit value exceeded the mean cutoff value for that specific arbovirus antigen. Five cutoff values were determined for each arbovirus antigen: I) the mean plus three times the standard deviation of the negative controls (i.e. \u2018NegCtrl\u2019) [18,65]; the change-point analysis, using R package \u2019changepoint\u2019 (version: 2.2.4), calculated at most one changepoint based on the II) mean (i.e. \u2018CHP.m\u2019), III) variance (i.e. \u2018CHP.v\u2019) and IV) a combination of mean and variance (i.e. \u2018CHP.mv\u2019) of wild-caught samples [74,75] and V) the maximum value of an average antibody curve (i.e. \u2018Recap\u2019). This curve was based on wild-caught individuals that were recaptured at least three times and showed seroconversion. Seroconversion of an individual was considered when the individual\u2019s maximum unit value was at least four-fold the minimum unit value. This four-fold increase is a standard seroconversion confirmation measure in human antibody studies [76]. An average antibody curve, with days as the explanatory variable, was created for each antigen by aligning the maximum unit value of each recaptured seroconverted individual to the same day. The binary results were used to calculate the seroprevalence for each arbovirus along with a 95% confidence interval (CI), using the \u2018binom.exact\u2019 from the package \u2018binom\u2019 (version: 1.1.1.1) [77].\n\nStatistical tests.The seroprevalence according to the different cutoff methods was compared to the seroprevalence of the antibody curve cutoff using the \u2018chisq.test\u2019 from the package \u2018stats\u2019 (version 4.3.3) [73]\nAs an indication of cross-reactivity in antibody response between the tested arboviruses, pair-wise Pearson correlations were calculated on the binary results, according to the antibody curve cutoff, of all samples using the \u2018corr.test\u2019 function of R package \u2018psych\u2019 (version: 2.4.1) [78]. The cross-reactivity in antibody response was visualized using the \u2018heatmap.2\u2019 function of the R package \u2018gplots\u2019 (version: 3.1.3) [79].\nA generalized linear model (logit link function and binomial error distribution) was constructed with the package \u2018stat\u2019 (version: 4.3.1), with the response variable being the binary serostatus of each sample [73]. Age (juvenile, subadult and adult), sex and their interaction were included as explanatory variables. The analysis of variance was performed using a likelihood ratio test, with p-values calculated assuming a chi-squared distribution. Pairwise comparison of the seroprevalence was performed between the six combinations of the explanatory variables (two levels of sex and three levels of age), using the \u2018emmeans\u2019 package (version: 1.8.9) [80]. To prevent reporting statistical findings based on the reliance of an arbitrary p-value of 0.05, we instead present significance in terms of levels of statistical support based on p-values. P-values exceeding 0.1 are labeled as \u201cno\u201d support and values around 0.05 (range 0.1\u2013\u2265 0.01, symbol: *) as \u201cweak\u201d support. \u201cModerate\u201d support was assigned to p-values clearly below 0.05 (range < 0.01\u2013\u2265 0.001, symbol: **), while \u201cstrong\u201d support is reserved for p-values lower than 0.05 (< 0.001, symbol: ***). This representation in terms of statistical support is based on current statistical reporting practices [81].",
    "Results": "In total 1,280 DBS samples were assessed of which 660 were female, consisting of 256 juveniles, 172 subadults and 232 adults, 620 samples were male with 199 juveniles, 313 subadults and 108 adults. Samples of recaptured individuals were considered as individual samples for all analyses.\n\nSeroprevalence\nThe seroprevalences according to the different cutoff methods showed at least a weak statistical support for a different seroprevalence compared to the antibody curve seroprevalence for almost all arboviruses. Histograms of the data and seroprevalence for each tested arbovirus antigen according to the different cutoff methods is shown in S1 and S2 Figs. The cutoff value according to the antibody curve based on the recaptured seroconverted individuals was used as the main cutoff value for all further calculations.\nThe overall arbovirus seroprevalence, defined as at least positive for one of the tested arboviruses, except ONNV, was almost 24% (95% CI: 21.89\u201326.66%; N = 1280). ONNV was excluded since the samples of the first session were not screened for antibodies against the ONNV antigen. The seroprevalence for Flaviviridae was 20% (95% CI: 17.99\u201322.46%; N = 1280) and for Togaviridae, excluding ONNV, almost 7% (95% CI: 5.48\u20138.32%; N = 1280). Overall, seroprevalences ranged from 0.62% for DENV3 (95% CI: 0.27\u20131.23%; N = 1280) and MAYV (95% CI: 0.27\u20131.23%; N = 1280) to 8.44% for DENV2 (95% CI: 6.97\u201310.10%; N = 1280), see Table 2.\n\n\nPairwise arbovirus serostatus correlation\nThe correlations in serostatus of samples between the tested arboviruses are visualized in Fig 2. Correlation between two arboviruses is depicted in color scale with the statistical symbol, lower triangle, and the number of positive samples in the upper triangle. The matrix is accompanied by a dendrogram based on the hierarchical clustering of the correlation coefficients. The branch lengths are a proxy for relative distance between arboviruses based on the serostatus response of the samples.\nSymbols in lower triangle represent significance of correlation, values in upper triangle, including diagonal line, represents the number of positive individuals for the corresponding arboviruses.\nThe correlation in sample response between the tested arboviruses ranged from -2.44% for TBEV and ZIKV with no statistical support (p = 0.384) to almost 59% between WSLV and USUV with a strong statistical support (p< 0.001). The dendrogram based on the hierarchical clustering of the correlation showed that WSLV\u2013USUV (correlation = 58.52%; p< 0.001), DENV2 \u2013DENV4 (correlation = 56.03%; p< 0.001) and DENV1 \u2013CHIKV (correlation = 50.31%; p< 0.001) are relatively closer to each other than to other tested arboviruses.\n\n\nModel analysis of antibody response\nSex, age, and interaction effects on serostatus.The generalized linear model indicated that there was a weak statistical interaction between the effects of sex and age on serostatus for DENV4 (Deviance [Df. = 2; Res.Df. = 1274] = 5.44; p = 0.066) and USUV (Deviance [Df. = 2; Res.Df. = 1274] = 7.72; p = 0.021). For the other tested arboviruses, no support for a statistical interaction was detected, the interaction was thus removed from those models. In the case of RVFV, no statistical support was found for an effect of sex, age, or the interaction on the serostatus. All results from generalized linear model\u2019s analysis of variance are reported in S2 Table.\nThe analysis of the sex variable showed a moderate support for males having a lower seroprevalence compared to females for DENV2 (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -0.665 \u00b1 0.242; p = 0.006) and WSLV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -1.446 \u00b1 0.483; p = 0.003). A weak statistical effect of a lower seroprevalence in males compared to females was detected in ZIKV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -0.643 \u00b1 0.386; p = 0.096), TBEV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -1.103 \u00b1 0.635; p = 0.083), CCHFV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -0.821 \u00b1 0.460; p = 0.074) and CHIKV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -0.633 \u00b1 0.296; p = 0.032). There was no support for a difference in seroprevalence between males and females for RVFV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = 0.097 \u00b1 0.381; p = 0.798), YFV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = 0.425 \u00b1 0.413; p = 0.304), DENV1 (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -0.377 \u00b1 0.248; p = 0.129), DENV3 (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -17.43 \u00b1 2021.76; p = 0.993), WNV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -0.009 \u00b1 0.397; p = 0.982), MAYV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -1.222 \u00b1 1.080; p = 0.258) and ONNV (Est. males \u00b1 SE = -17.75 \u00b1 1663.70; p = 0.991).\nThe analysis of the age variable showed a strong statistical support for a higher seroprevalence in subadults than in juveniles for DENV1 and DENV2, a moderate support for CHIKV and a weak support for YFV, ZIKV, TBEV, WSLV and CCHFV. There was no support for a difference in subadult and juvenile seroprevalence in the other tested arboviruses. A significantly higher seroprevalence in adults compared to juveniles was shown for ZIKV, DENV1, DENV2, WSLV and CHIKV with a strong support. A moderate support for a higher seroprevalence in adults than in juveniles was detected for YFV and CCHFV. Adults showed a weak statistical support for a higher seroprevalence in contrast to juveniles for WNV and TBEV. All other tested arboviruses showed no support for a statistical difference between adults and juveniles. The comparison between subadults and adults showed a strongly supported statistical difference for DENV1 and CHIKV with a higher seroprevalence in adults. A moderate support for a higher seroprevalence in adults compared to subadults was detected for ZIKV and CCHFV. Yellow Fever virus, WNV, WSLV and ONNV showed a weak support for a statistically higher seroprevalence in adults than in subadults. The other arboviruses showed no statistically significant difference between adults and subadults. See Table 3 for estimates, standard errors, and p-values.\nIn the case of DENV4, there was a weak support for an interaction between the effects of age and sex: the analysis showed that there was a strong statistical support for a higher seroprevalence in female adults compared to female juveniles (Est. female\u2014adult \u00b1 SE = 1.844 \u00b1 0.486; p< 0.001). A moderate support was shown for a higher seroprevalence in female subadults compared to female juveniles (Est. female\u2014subadult \u00b1 SE = 1.379 \u00b1 0.517; p = 0.008) and a weak support for a higher seroprevalence in female adults compared to male adults (Est. female\u2014adult \u00b1 SE = 1.898 \u00b1 0.736; p = 0.010). For USUV the model analysis with a weak interaction, showed that there was weak statistical support for a higher seroprevalence in female adults compared to female subadults (Est. female\u2014adult \u00b1 SE = 0.868 \u00b1 0.345; p = 0.012) and also a weak support for a higher seroprevalence in female adults compared to male adults (Est. female\u2014adult \u00b1 SE = 1.515 \u00b1 0.612; p = 0.013).\nFig 3 displays the seroprevalence for the six distinct levels (two levels of sex and three levels of age) for all tested arboviruses, with statistical support lines based on the log odds.\nStatistical support on seroprevalence difference is indicated by asterisks in the horizontal lines. Sample size: 660 females of which 256 juveniles, 172 subadults and 232 adult and 620 males with 199 juveniles, 313 subadults and 108 adults. Sample sizes for ONNV are 560 females: 150 juveniles, 150 subadults, 260 adults and 266 males: 94 juveniles, 92 subadults and 80 adults.",
    "Discussion": "In this study, we optimized a high-throughput multiplex immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies against 15 medically relevant arboviruses and used it to investigate the potential of M. natalensis to serve as a host for arboviruses. Besides the high throughput and multiplexing possibility, bead-based Luminex assays come with several other advantages, such as the small sample volumes required for testing, the compatibility with diverse sample types, incl. eluted DBS, the cost-effectiveness with lower reagent cost and reduced labor time, a broad dynamic range for accurate quantification, a reduced variability as a result of running multiple analytes in a single assay, and the versatility and flexibility of customizable panels. We describe the screening results of an archived set of wild M. natalensis DBS samples. Our results revealed an overall seroprevalence of 24% against the entire panel of tested antigens. Virus family-specific seroprevalences were approximately 2.6%, 20%, 2.8% and 7% for respectively Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, Nairoviridae and Togaviridae. We further found that female rodents were more likely to be classified as antibody positive for eight of the 15 tested arboviruses. Additionally, positivity increased significantly with age for almost all tested arboviruses.\nThe lack of realistic natural positive controls limits the possibility to calculate the assay\u2019s sensitivity and determine a true cutoff, we therefore used recaptured seroconverted individuals to determine a cutoff value. The use of antibody titers at multiple time points are a standard practice to determine antibody or pathogen development and (sero)conversions in human studies [76]. However, multiple samples of an individual animal across time are often impossible or very difficult in wildlife studies. Our study is unique in that regard that we have measurements of individual recaptured M. natalensis. We consider that our cutoff based on seroconverted individuals is a good proxy for the natural cutoff value, since it is based on similar methods as in human studies [76]. We tried to show in our analysis that the tested mathematical methods could approximate this calculated cutoff and thus provide a method for future studies that do not have access to recaptured seroconverted wildlife samples. Unfortunately, the tested cutoff methods did not significantly approximate the seroprevalence according to the cutoff using samples from recaptures. The negative control-based cutoff (i.e., the mean plus three times the standard deviation of the negative control samples) gave unrealistic high seroprevalences. This can be explained by the fact that the negative control samples originate from a breeding colony and could thus also not be used to determine the assay\u2019s specificity. These animals have thus never been exposed to a natural environment and the pathogens that occur in the environment.\nThe statistical methods vary in their seroprevalence with some methods approximating the estimated seroprevalence according to the recaptured cutoff. This high degree of variation makes it difficult to decide on one method that works for all the tested arboviruses. The cutoff value for CCHFV seems extremely high compared to the other arboviruses, but the unit values for CCHFV are also much higher than for the other arboviruses (see S1 Fig). The reason is that the unit values are calculated based on the positive dilution series and the positive controls for CCHFV were not of the same magnitude as for the other arboviruses. The value in determining a cutoff and the resulting seroprevalence is that it allows the comparison of results with previous and future studies on arbovirus seroprevalence in rodents or other wildlife. We are aware that the used cutoff and resulting seroprevalences could be an over- or underestimation and might not reflect the natural arbovirus seroprevalence. We therefore encourage future research to investigate and compare different cutoff methods for arbovirus (or pathogen) antibody detection in wildlife studies.\nThe detection of antibodies against each of 15 tested arbovirus antigens indicates that these arboviruses, or closely related viruses, are present in M. natalensis. The overall arbovirus seroprevalence of 24% suggests that this rodent species is commonly infected with one or more arboviruses and that it could thus play a significant role in virus transmission and persistence. Our results corroborate previous studies, which detected USUV and WNV RNA in respectively M. natalensis and M. erythroleucus, in Senegal [24,54]. Besides in this genus, arboviral RNA has also been found in other rodents in Africa, such as Rattus rattus for USUV and WSLV and Desmodillus auricularis for WSLV [22,24,53]. The findings in our study thus further corroborate that arboviruses are likely present in rodents, and specifically in the ubiquitous M. natalensis. The demographic and ecological characteristics of M. natalensis may have particularly important implications for arbovirus transmission. The population densities of M. natalensis in Tanzania are strongly dependent on weather conditions. More specifically, early rainfall and elevated temperatures lead to an exponential growth in the population density, due to an increase influx of juveniles [29,30,32]. The rainfall and increased temperatures are also beneficial for the breeding of mosquitoes and the multiplication of arboviruses within these vectors [82]. Further, M. natalensis is highly abundant around houses and in the crop fields at the fringes of the villages. These factors increase the likelihood of arbovirus outbreaks in M. natalensis populations, with the possibility of spillover to humans.\nArboviruses that show the highest seroprevalence are DENV1, DENV2, DENV4 and CHIKV, with seroprevalences between five to nine percent. These seroprevalences could be caused by cross-reactivity due to antibodies of other dengue virus serotypes or other flaviviruses binding to the non-structural protein 1 (NS1 protein) of DENV1, DENV2 and DENV4. The same effect could also be true for alphaviruses binding to the envelope protein 2 (E2 protein) of CHIKV. Whether these seroprevalences are indeed due to the presence of the arbovirus specific antibodies or a related arbovirus remains to be investigated. Nonetheless, it indicates that a part of the sampled M. natalensis population in Morogoro is exposed to dengue virus and CHIKV or respectively to a related flavivirus and alphavirus. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that flavi- and alphaviruses are the most prevalent arboviral genera in humans, compared to other arbovirus genera, and potentially thus also in rodents involved in the sylvatic cycle [83,84].\nA recent health survey has shown that, in our samples\u2019 region of origin, a high percentage of the human population is seropositive for CHIKV (9.83%) [55]. Another study in the same region reported acute infection of CHIKV in 1.28% of patients with fever and malaria-like symptoms [85]. Although these studies have not found any indication of dengue virus in humans, a large-scale cross-sectional study in Tanzania has found CHIKV and dengue virus antibodies in respectively 28.0% and 16.1% of the population [56]. These studies clearly indicate that the human population in Tanzania is exposed to arboviruses and then specifically to CHIKV and DENV.\nThe cross-reactivity analysis via the correlation matrix and hierarchical clustering (Fig 2) showed an antibody response correlation between WSLV\u2013USUV (59%), DENV2 \u2013DENV4 (56%) and DENV1 \u2013CHIKV (50%). We expected that phylogenetically related arboviruses would show elevated levels of correlation due to cross-reactivity [86]. A remarkable result in this cross-reactivity analysis is that DENV1 \u2013CHIKV cluster together with a correlation of 50%, based on the serostatus of the tested samples. The branch DENV1/CHIKV clusters also closer to ONNV than to the branches of WSLV/USUV and DENV2/DENV4. This is unexpected since CHIKV belongs to the Togaviridae and DENV1 to the Flaviviridae [87]. The proteins used for the antibody detection are also two different proteins, with the E2 protein used for the Togaviridae and NS1 protein for the Flaviviridae, thus limiting the possibility of cross-reactivity. Although we cannot exclude that there might be similar epitopes between the different proteins, other studies have already indicated that cross-reactivity between the E2 protein of the Togaviridae and NS1 protein of the Flaviviridae is limited [88,89]. The residue identity between the two proteins is also less then 13% according to the amino acid alignment algorithm of Geneious Prime. Given that both Togaviridae and Flaviviridae viruses are circulating in humans in East Africa, we hypothesize that these viral families may also both be present in rodents [5,10]. More specifically, it is plausible that both viral families could be found in M. natalensis, where pathogen co-infections are common [49]. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that some viruses in both families are transmitted by the same arthropod vectors, such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus for both dengue virus and CHIKV [4,82].\nFor some of the tested arboviruses, we found statistical support for a higher seroprevalence in females than in males. This result is supported by previous studies where it is shown that female mice have a stronger innate immune response than male mice [90]. In other animals (e.g., birds, fish, insects) as well as humans, females also display stronger immune responses [91\u201395]. The major driving forces behind these immune differences are genetic (i.e., X-chromosome-linked) and hormonal (i.e., different estrogen and testosterone levels) [96]. In the case of M. natalensis, behavioral differences could also be the cause for this divergence in seroprevalence. Previous studies have already shown that home range, behavior and pathogen presence differ between male and female M. natalensis [48,97]. These inherent sex differences in sensitivity to infections could influence the seroprevalence, where the calculated cutoff value could be an over or under estimation for a particular sex. However, since our sample size of males (N = 620) and females (N = 660) is approximately the same this influence was considered to be insignificant. Besides the sex effects, we also found statistical support for a positive age effect on the presence of antibodies in some of the tested arboviruses. This increased seroprevalence with age corroborates previous findings for other pathogens (i.e., Bartonella sp., Anaplasma sp., helminths, and arenaviruses) [48,49,98]. This age effect further supports our hypothesis that M. natalensis is exposed to arboviruses and that individuals develop antibodies and gain immunity via repeated exposures throughout their life. To maintain the arbovirus transmission in the M. natalensis population, there needs to be a proportion of the population that is either chronically infected or immunologically na\u00efve. Chronic infections in M. natalensis have already been documented for mammarenaviruses [31,99]. However, as far as we are aware, naturally occurring chronic arbovirus infections have not been reported in humans or non-human vertebrates. Therefore, the presumable driving factor in sustained transmission is the presence of immunologically na\u00efve individuals. During the breeding season, which coincides with increased rainfall and temperature, there is an influx of immunologically na\u00efve juveniles. This influx can reach high proportions during population outbreak periods [30,64]. We thus expect that it is juveniles who are the major factor in sustaining the arbovirus transmission cycle. We predict that the prevalence of arboviral genetic material will be higher in juveniles than in adults, since juveniles do not possess the necessary antibodies to fight of the infection.\nWe conclude from our detected antibody responses that arboviruses, or related viruses, are present in M. natalensis in Morogoro, Tanzania. The higher seroprevalence we detect in females can be explained by genetic, hormonal, ecological and/or behavioral differences between sexes. Individuals are exposed to these viruses throughout their life and gain immunity as they age. We hypothesize that juvenile M. natalensis play an essential role in sustaining arbovirus transmission as they are immunologically na\u00efve and can reach high densities in favorable climate conditions that coincide with optimal vector conditions. More extensive screening, such as virus neutralization tests and molecular screening of these viruses within M. natalensis are necessary to quantify the contribution of this rodent species in the arbovirus transmission cycle."
