To eliminate vivax malaria treatment is required that cures the blood infection and also kills any dormant parasites in the liver (called hypnozoites). Unfortunately, drugs currently available to treat hypnozoites such as primaquine can cause severe haemolysis when given to patients who have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a common human enzyme polymorphism. The author created a mathematical model that compares the number of severe haemolysis events and vivax recurrences within 6 months of treatment in a theoretical population when qualitative G6PD tests are used to guide primaquine treatment versus the use of primaquine without consideration of the G6PD status of the patient. The results demonstrate that adding G6PD tests into the clinical pathway can reduce the number of severe haemolysis events, but may increase the number of recurrences, with specific results determined by the prevalence of G6PD deficiency, the dosing regiment and adherence to the prescribed primaquine treatment.
