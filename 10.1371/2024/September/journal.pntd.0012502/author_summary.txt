This present study indicates that a liver-targeted lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying siRNA against type I TGF-β receptor (TGFβRI) mRNA that we designed could be used to treat schistosomiasis-induced liver fibrosis. We demonstrated a liver-specific accumulation of LNPs upon intravenous injection in BALB/c mice at drug dose of 0.1 or 1 mg/kg twice a week for 4 weeks. In vitro and in vivo experiments both revealed reduced activation of HSC and alleviated liver fibrosis in S. mansoni-infected mice. The fibrotic markers αSMA and Col1a1 and serum cytokines including GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and KC (CXCL1) from liver tissues were significantly suppressed in LNP-siTGFβRI treatment groups. FACS results indicated that following LNP-siTGFβRI treatment, CD56d NK cells showed downregulation, while B cell and memory Th cell populations were upregulated. Histological analysis showed the density of fibrotic regions were significantly decreased with LNP-siTGFβRI treatment in a dose-dependent manner and no systemic toxicity was observed in major organs. In this study, we provide a potentially targeted siRNA delivery strategy reducing granulomatous lesions for schistosomiasis-induced liver fibrosis treatment without detectable side effects. It is hoped that this study will provide effective new treatments for liver fibrosis caused by schistosomiasis in the future.
