Evidence indicates that children living in difficult situations are at high risk of scabies infestation. Street children are one of these groups with higher susceptibility to scabies due to their living conditions. Living as a street child in resource-limited areas substantially increases vulnerability to the condition because of lack of access to healthcare services and other resources to maintain personal hygiene. This study employed a qualitative approach to understand the susceptibility of street children in Addis Ababa to scabies and their health seeking behavior. The study revealed that scabies is very common among children of the street in the area. The participants associated susceptibility to their living conditions that include sleeping arrangements, sharing of clothes and other materials. They also reported the use of both traditional and modern medicine to treat scabies. The physical, psychological, and social consequences of scabies infestation have also been identified. Although most believe that scabies relates to poor hygiene practices and attempts to prevent the condition have been reported, lack of resources posed significant challenges. We recommend sustainable reunification and reintegration of the street children to help reduce the burden of scabies among street children.
