The study of fungal neglected pathogens is of significant importance for the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the diseases they cause. The Paracoccidioides lutzii fungus is a pathogen endemic to Latin America, which causes disease in vulnerable portions of society. To cause the disease, the fungal cells must overcome the immune system and obtain nutrients that are typically withdrawn by the host. In this regard, different molecules are crucial for the establishment of infection. The formamidase enzyme plays a role in the survival of the fungus P. lutzii. Our study, presented below, demonstrates that formamidase silencing affects the immune response of G. mellonella larvae to the fungus, resulting in impairment of nodule formation, diminished melanin production, and a reduction in fungal burden. Furthermore, silencing formamidase expression in P. lutzii doubles the survival rate of larvae infected by the fungus, showing its importance for these yeast cells to infect this animals.
