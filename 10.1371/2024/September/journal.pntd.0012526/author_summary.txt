Human infection following accidental consumption of Angiostrongylus cantonensis can cause eosinophilic meningoencephalitis. Albendazole is the drug of choice for treatment, followed by continuous use of analgesics and corticosteroids, which may have safety concerns. On the other hand, flavonoids are derived from natural plants and have been shown to improve cognitive function by inhibiting the central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. However, the effect of flavonoids combined with albendazole in treating angiostrongyliasis is still unclear. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of flavonoids in combination with albendazole for A. cantonensis infection. Our results found that quercetin exhibited the most significant therapeutic effect with albendazole, by which the combined regimen improved the brain histopathology and recovered the miceâ€™s neurological functions. This combined therapy also reduces inflammasome activation, pyroptosis, apoptosis, and immune imbalance in the infected mouse brains. Our current study indicated that quercetin possessed the potential as an anti-inflammatory drug and may be helpful in the treatment of A. cantonensis-induced meningoencephalitis.
