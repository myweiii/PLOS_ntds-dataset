    "Abstract": "Little is known about the role of horse flies in potential pathogen transmission in Chile. This study provides evidence of the molecular detection of microorganisms in southern Chile. In the present study, adult Osca lata horse flies were trapped from Punucapa (39\u00b045\u201906\u201dS/73\u00b016\u201908\u201dW, Regi\u00f3n de Los R\u00edos) and Puyehue (40\u00b039\u201910\u201dS/72\u00b010\u201957\u201dW, Regi\u00f3n de Los Lagos), Chile. Among the 95 samples analyzed by PCR using specific primers, microorganisms were detected in 23.2% (n = 22) of the samples. Rickettsia spp. DNA was detected in 15.8% (n = 15) of the samples, Trypanosomatidae DNA in 5.3% (n = 5) of the samples, and filarial DNA in 2.1% (n = 2) of the samples. This study found that horse flies in the region are capable of carrying a variety of both parasites and endosymbionts. Further research is needed to understand the specific impact of horse flies as mechanical or biological vectors and develop effective control measures to prevent the spread of any microorganisms associated with disease."
