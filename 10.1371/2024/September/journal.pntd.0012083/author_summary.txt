Our study focused on understanding the prevalence and risk factors associated with Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) exposure among humans, livestock, and wild animals in Isiolo County, Kenya. Through a comprehensive sero-epidemiological investigation and a confirmatory test using RT-qPCR, we found varying seroprevalences across different species, with camels exhibiting the highest prevalence of the various livestock species sampled. Wild animals, notably giraffes, also displayed significant seroprevalences. Factors such as gender, age, and herd seropositivity were identified as significant contributors to CCHFV exposure among humans, while environmental factors like vegetation indices and vapor pressure influenced livestock exposure.
Our findings underscore the intricate interplay between human, animal, and environmental factors in CCHFV transmission dynamics. By elucidating these factors, we provide crucial insights for policymakers to develop targeted interventions and surveillance strategies, emphasizing the importance of a One-Health approach. Implementing control measures in livestock, such as acaricide application, could effectively mitigate CCHFV transmission to humans. Additionally, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and workplace education for animal related professions are crucial for preventing human infections.
