We are also indebted to the officials in the national ministries of Health and Agriculture, as well as the County government of Isiolo, for granting approval for this study to take place. We would also like to thank officers from the veterinary department at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) for helping us with wild animalsâ€™ blood sampling.
