Psathyromyia cratifer is a species of Neotropical dipteran belonging to one of the most medically important groups worldwide wise, the Phlebotomine sand flies. Some sand fly species transmit Leishmania parasites to humans, which leads to one of the most common but neglected tropical diseases known as leishmaniasis. The data on life history traits and involvement of this species in the transmission of Leishmania, is yet limited. This research furnishes evidence about population dynamics and temporal Leishmania infection patterns in female Pa. cratifer specimens collected from four sites part of a transmission area in Yucatan, Mexico. Our findings suggest that females of this species are attracted to and feed on humans as well as an important Leishmania reservoir in the region. Although not all sites recorded infected individuals, the infection and temporal abundance of this species in most sites, were similar. Our findings suggest that this species could be a suspected vector of the parasite in the region, however, it is important to continue with incrimination studies that incorporate other sources of evidence.
