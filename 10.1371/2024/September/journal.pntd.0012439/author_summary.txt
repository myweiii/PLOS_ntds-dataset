HTNV causes severe HFRS in Eastern Asia. Previous studies reported genetic variants or new genotypes of HTNV in animals in South Korea and many parts of China. However, little is known about the clinical characteristics of patients infected by the HTNV variant, because it is difficult to isolate HTNV from patients, and few HTNV variants were confirmed from patients. In this study, we use PBMC from patient to coculture with Vero-E6 cells and a 28-day passage isolation protocol for vial isolation, 13 HTNVs were successfully isolated from patients with a recovery rate of over 40%. We also established an amplicon-based next-generation sequencing method for HTNV whole gene sequencing and whole genome sequences of HTNVs from 14 patients were obtained. Genetic analysis revealed that the complete sequences from the patients showed significant variations in nucleotide and amino acid to the HTNVs found in other areas. Viral isolation and whole genome sequencing confirm that the HTNV variant causes human infection in Jiangxi province. The clinical symptoms of HFRS caused by the HTNV genetic variant during the acute phase are atypical, and laboratory diagnoses are needed. These results provide useful guidance for orthohantaviruses isolation from clinical cases and are important for HFRS diagnosis in clinical practice.
