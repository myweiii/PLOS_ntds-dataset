Mosquito vectors are strongly affected by temperature, and their distributions are likely to shift under climate change. Lab studies show that mosquito abundance has a unimodal response to temperature with thermal optima, upper and lower thermal limits. However, it remains unknown how mosquito laboratory-derived thermal responses relate to the thermal responses of mosquitoes in nature. We used a global database of field-collected mosquito occurrences, geospatial environmental covariates, and species distribution models to estimate the relationship between temperature and probability of mosquito occurrence. We found that thermal minima (r = 0.87) and, to a lesser degree, thermal optima (r = 0.69) estimated from laboratory studies were correlated with those from the species distribution models. For most species, we did not detect thermal maxima. These results suggest that laboratory studies and field-based machine learning studies are complementary. Together, they can help to better understand vector response to climate change.
