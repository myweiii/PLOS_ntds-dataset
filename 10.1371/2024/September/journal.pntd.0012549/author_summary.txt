Cases of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, spread through sandflies infected with a Leishmania protozoan parasite, have risen in the past several decades. Though rarely fatal, cutaneous leishmaniasis causes highly stigmatizing skin lesions, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis can destroy mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, and throat. Leishmaniasis is frequently found in areas with high levels of poverty, infrastructure destruction (e.g., of healthcare and water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities), displacement, and poor living conditions. Conflicts often create environments that are hospitable to leishmaniasis emergence, re-emergence, and transmission. Environmental factors, like temperature and precipitation, can also affect leishmaniasis incidence through impacts on the sandfly vector and on humans’ proximity to the vector. In our ecological study, we measured the association between conflict and leishmaniasis over 18 years while accounting for other factors, such as environmental conditions and population displacement, that are relevant to leishmaniasis’ spread. We found that conflict was significantly associated with increased risk of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis across the 52 included nations. Population displacement played an important role in the relationship between conflict and leishmaniasis incidence. This work is important for understanding global drivers of the increasing leishmaniasis burden in order to enhance preparedness efforts.
