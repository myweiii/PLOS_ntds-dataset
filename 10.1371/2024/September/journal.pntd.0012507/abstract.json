    "Background": "Assessing how interventions are implemented is essential to understanding why interventions may or may not achieve their intended outcomes. There is little evidence about how interventions against Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are being implemented. Guided by the Context and Implementation of Complex Intervention (CICI) framework, we evaluated an ongoing intervention against the NTD podoconiosis to examine the implementation process and its effectiveness in terms of improving shoe wearing practices, increasing knowledge and reducing stigmatizing attitudes towards podoconiosis in rural Ethiopia.",
    "Methods": "We employed an exploratory mixed methods approach, qualitative followed by quantitative, between April and July 2022 to assess implementation agents, theory, strategy, process and outcomes of the intervention. We conducted document analysis, observations, focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews for the qualitative phase. We administered a survey to 369 rural residents, of whom 42 were affected by podoconiosis.",
    "Results": "The implementers utilized government healthcare centers in a bid to mainstream podoconiosis services within local healthcare structures. The implementers provided training for health professionals and the public and distributed supplies to patients over a three-month period. The intervention reached 62% of patients, but female patients were less likely to participate than male patients. Only 18% of community members had participated in health education campaigns linked to the intervention. Involvement in the intervention resulted in improved shoe wearing practice and holding fewer stigmatizing attitudes. However, internalized stigma among patients was still rife; and the plan to utilize community assets to extend the intervention activities was not effective.",
    "Conclusions": "Implementers must monitor the fidelity and progression of programs on a constant basis to make corrections. They also need to expand health education, provide psychosocial support and design economic empowerment programs for patients to reduce stigma. They must also collaborate with policy makers and international partners to sustain program activities at intervention delivery points."
