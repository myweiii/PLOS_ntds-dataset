Although many interventions against Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries, little is known about how intervention activities have been put into practice or their outcomes in improving health behaviour or reducing stigma. In this study, the authors examined a health intervention against one of the NTDs known as podoconiosis. The disease causes leg swelling among patients and attracts stigma. Podoconiosis can be prevented by wearing shoes consistently. The evaluated intervention was implemented by two non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The NGOs delivered the project activities using local healthcare settings and professionals. The intervention improved access to treatment and health resources for affected individuals. It also contributed to reduction of stigmatizing attitudes and improved shoe wearing practices. Despite this success, the intervention activities were not sustainable ‚Äê some activities were not implemented as intended and others curtailed due to limited budget. Existing socio-cultural factors such as gender inequality and low economic status of patients also created constraints. These findings may contribute to the design of complex interventions to improve the lives of people affected by NTDs.
