Leptospirosis is one of the underrecognized and neglected diseases of humans and animals. The presence of numerous Leptospira species/serovars infecting a broad range of animal reservoirs, and the resulting environmental contamination, makes control and prevention a cumbersome task. The bacterin-based vaccines available for animals do offer a limited protection against disease or renal colonization. A broader cross-protective vaccine is essentially needed to prevent Leptospira infections in humans and animals. Here we rationally selected a protein target based on its capacity to be recognized by antibodies of naturally infected animals and designed a recombinant vaccine. Our MCP vaccine was not effective in protecting mice from acute and chronic disease and likely led to exacerbation of clinical signs in these animals. The development of an effective vaccine would contribute to controlling Leptospira infection in humans and animals and is important, especially in low-income regions where leptospirosis is more prevalent and interventions to control the disease are not currently available.
