    "Background": "The parasite species Plasmodium ovalecurtisi (P. ovalecurtisi) and Plasmodium ovalewallikeri (P. ovalewallikeri), formerly known as Plasmodium ovale, are endemic across multiple African countries. These species are thought to differ in clinical symptomatology and latency, but only a small number of existing diagnostic assays can detect and distinguish them. In this study, we sought to develop new assays for the detection and differentiation of P. ovalecurtisi and P. ovalewallikeri by leveraging recently published whole-genome sequences for both species.",
    "Methods": "Repetitive sequence motifs were identified in available P. ovalecurtisi and P. ovalewallikeri genomes and used for assay development and validation. We evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the best-performing singleplex and duplex assays using synthetic plasmids. We then evaluated the specificity of the duplex assay using a panel of samples from Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and validated its performance using 55 P. ovale samples and 40 non-ovale Plasmodium samples from the DRC.",
    "Results": "The best-performing P. ovalecurtisi and P. ovalewallikeri targets had 9 and 8 copies within the reference genomes, respectively. The P. ovalecurtisi assay had high sensitivity with a 95% confidence lower limit of detection (LOD) of 3.6 parasite genome equivalents/\u03bcl, while the P. ovalewallikeri assay had a 95% confidence LOD of 25.9 parasite genome equivalents/\u03bcl. A duplex assay targeting both species had 100% specificity and 95% confidence LOD of 4.2 and 41.2 parasite genome equivalents/\u03bcl for P. ovalecurtisi and P. ovalewallikeri, respectively.",
    "Conclusions": "We identified promising multi-copy targets for molecular detection and differentiation of P. ovalecurtisi and P. ovalewallikeri and used them to develop real-time PCR assays. The best performing P. ovalecurtisi assay performed well in singleplex and duplex formats, while the P. ovalewallikeri assay did not reliably detect low-density infections in either format. These assays have potential use for high-throughput identification of P. ovalecurtisi, or for identification of higher density P. ovalecurtisi or P. ovalewallikeri infections that are amenable to downstream next-generation sequencing."
