Non-falciparum malaria appears to be on the rise, especially in settings where P. falciparum transmission is declining. Plasmodium ovalecurtisi and Plasmodium ovalewallikeri are neglected parasites that can cause relapsing malaria and are thought to differ in clinical symptomatology and latency. However, few existing diagnostic assays can detect and distinguish them. Most target the 18S rRNA gene of both P. ovalecurtisi and P. ovalewallikeri with potential for cross-reactivity at higher parasite densities, and are not well-suited for high-throughput use, hindering our understanding of their epidemiology. Mining recently available P. ovalecurtisi and P. ovalewallikeri reference genomes, we identify new multi-copy targets for molecular detection and develop novel singleplex and duplex real-time PCR assays capable of species differentiation. These assays are highly specific and require short turn-around time. The P. ovalecurtisi assay performed well, while the P. ovalewallikeri assay did not reliably detect low-density infections. These assays provide new options for high-throughput studies of P. ovalecurtisi infection, as well as identification of higher density infections amenable to next-generation sequencing of both species.
