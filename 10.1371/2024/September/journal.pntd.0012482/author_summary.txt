The mosquito Aedes aegypti is responsible for transmitting several viruses to humans, including Zika, yellow fever, chikungunya, and dengue. The geographic distribution of this tropical, anthropophilic mosquito vector continues to expand globally due to climate change and increasing urbanization. Ambient temperature and larval densities are two of the most powerful factors in the aquatic juvenile stage in determining adult mosquito traits. Using a meta-analysis, we reveal that urban environments are associated with greater crowding in the larval phase for Ae. aegypti. In the laboratory, we then demonstrate that similar levels of larval crowding also led to increased dengue virus loads in adults following an infectious bloodmeal, which may increase transmission. In contrast, higher temperatures in the larval phase were associated with reduced viral loads in adults, but only when crowding is not present. This is a concerning relationship given that 68% of the worldâ€™s population will live in urban environments by 2050.
