In tropical and sub-tropical regions with limited access to clean potable water, hygiene, and sanitation, infections with intestinal worms (e.g. giant roundworm, whipworm, and hookworms) are widespread, primarily affecting school-aged children (SAC). These infections lead to malnutrition, anemia, and developmental issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a strategy in 2020 to control intestinal worm infections, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnostic tests. The current recommended method, Kato-Katz (KK1.0), though cost-effective, has limitations in terms of reproducibility and sensitivity. To address this, an artificial intelligence digital pathology (AI-DP)-based Kato-Katz method (KK2.0) was developed to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study in Ucayali (Amazonian region of Peru) evaluated KK2.0’s performance compared to KK1.0 in detecting intestinal worm infections among SAC. Stool samples from 510 SAC (5–14 years) were collected and analyzed using KK1.0 and KK2.0. KK2.0 demonstrated comparable diagnostic performance to KK1.0, with higher sensitivity for low-intensity giant roundworm infections. Prevalence rates differed between KK2.0 and KK1.0, indicating KK2.0’s potential to identify additional infections. Overall, the findings suggest KK2.0’s effectiveness in diagnosing STH infections, highlighting its potential to improve surveillance and treatment programs. Further research should address technical issues and assess KK2.0 in diverse settings, advancing its application for neglected tropical disease diagnosis.
