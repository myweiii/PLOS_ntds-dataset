Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, presents significant health challenges worldwide, with the potential for avoidable disabilities if left untreated. While MDT has substantially reduced the disease burden since its introduction in 1982, historical records suggest that some cases of leprosy exhibit spontaneous resolution without medical intervention. However, the prevalence of self-healing globally and the factors influencing this phenomenon remain unclear.
The review identified six studies conducted between 1938 and 1978, which examined the occurrence of self-healing in various countries. These studies revealed that children and individuals with PB leprosy demonstrated a higher likelihood of self-healing, typically within an average period of two years. Despite the limited recent evidence due to ethical considerations, self-healing appears to be a plausible phenomenon influenced by patient-specific characteristics and the type of leprosy infection.
Ultimately, this paper presents a compelling case for future research on self-healing in leprosy, as it provides an interesting view on the human immune system as well as the determinants of this phenomenon. Our recommendations emphasize the necessity of such investigations to adapt clinical practices and public health strategies, thereby contributing to an effective management and control of this disease.
