The role of infectious agents in the occurrence of cancer is increasingly studied. Microsporidia are pathogens that can cause intestinal damage leading to severe diarrhea in humans. Data previously published would allow to consider a role of microsporidia in the occurrence of colorectal cancer. Our objective here was to provide epidemiological data concerning the association of microsporidia and cancer, which will be additional arguments that can justify in-depth work to study a potential causal link. To do this, we have developed tests to detect antibodies directed against a species of microsporidia, Encephalitozoon intestinalis. Our results show higher levels of antibodies against E. intestinalis among patients with colorectal cancer, compared to individuals without cancer, particularly in men. We also found that levels of certain antibodies were lower in women who survived cancer compared to those who died, possibly suggesting that this is a prognostic marker. All of these results support an epidemiological link between microsporidia, or at least certain species, and colon carcinogenesis.
