Onchocerciasis is endemic in Mahenge, with epidemiological evidence that the parasite (Onchocerca volvulus) may be associated with epilepsy. The high burden of the disease in Mahenge led to the introduction of Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) in 1997. Despite the long history of CDTI implementation in Mahenge, the persistent transmission of the parasite is still reported. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the current prevalence of onchocerciasis and epilepsy 25 years after the start of the CDTI programme.
The prevalence of epilepsy was 21.1 (95%CI: 19.9–22.3) cases per 1000 people. The incidence of epilepsy one year preceding the survey was 117 (95%CI: 99.7–160.4) per 100,000 person-years. Despite high self-reported coverage of ivermectin (88%), active onchocerciasis transmission was observed among children aged 6–11 years, and more than half of the individuals with epilepsy (54.1%) were serologically positive for onchocerciasis. The predictors for epilepsy were sex (female), age ≥ 10 years, being a resident of Mahenge for ≥20 years, especially in villages located at a medium altitude, and being onchocerciasis positive. Strengthening of processes to ensure bi-annual ivermectin treatment is recommended.
