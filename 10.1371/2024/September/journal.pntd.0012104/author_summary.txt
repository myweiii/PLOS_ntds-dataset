Urogenital schistosomiasis is a chronic debilitating disease affecting populations living in Africa and the Middle East and showing a strong association with poverty. Accurate detection of infection is important both for disease treatment and surveillance. Several tests based on detection in plasma of parasite protein (CAA), parasite DNA or parasite-specific host antibodies (IgM and IgG against SWAP and SEA antigens) are available, and this study aims at comparing them to evaluate their accuracy. The comparison showed that tests based on parasite CAA or DNA yield very similar results and therefore the test of choice for diagnosis or epidemiological investigations can be based on laboratory resources. Additionally, the comparison showed that IgG against SWAP and SEA outperform IgM, and that high accuracy can be achieved by identifying an optimal level to determine positivity (cutoff), making these antibody tests ideal for surveillance purposes.
