The parasitic trematode S. haematobium affects 110 million people worldwide. Many studies have described the effects of schistosome infections on humans and animals, but data focusing solely on S. haematobium infections, which cause urogenital schistosomiasis are scarce. Our goal was to evaluate, in a systematic manner, how S. haematobium infection affects the immune system, gene expression and microbiome of the host. These effects are important because they could lead to increased risk of infections, such as HIV, and bladder cancer. We screened 3,177 studies for potential relevance and included 94 of them in this review. Our analysis showed that S. haematobium infection profoundly alters the immune system with a mixed pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory response, though with a predominant type 2 immune phenotype and increased regulatory cells. We further found consistent evidence that it impairs local mucosal epithelial barrier integrity, promotes cellular transformation with pro-oncogenic changes in the host, and is associated with microbial alterations in urine, stool, and genital tracts. We discuss how these findings might be interpreted, and the additional research needed, to improve our understanding of S. haematobium pathophysiology and ameliorate the potential sequelae of S. haematobium infection, such as increased viral infections and cancer.
