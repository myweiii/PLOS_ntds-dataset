The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has reshaped our understanding of respiratory viruses, highlighting the challenges in etiological diagnosis due to symptom similarities. Metagenomics, an innovative approach, has revolutionized respiratory infection diagnosis by unbiasedly sequencing all genetic material in a sample, enabling the identification of previously unknown or unsuspected viruses where traditional methods often fail. In a study conducted in Alagoas, a Northeast Brazilian state with low human development indexes, samples obtained from patients with flu-like symptoms negative for locally applied diagnostic kits revealed diagnostic escape of rhinoviruses and a notably prevalent enterovirus D68. Additionally, substantial reads attributed to human respirovirus 3 (parainfluenza virus 3) and various herpesviruses, including human herpesvirus-1, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesviruses 6 and 7, and human parvovirus B19, were identified. These findings are pivotal for differentiating viruses not detected by routinely implemented diagnostic procedures. Metagenomics shows great promise in diagnosing and surveilling respiratory viruses, providing insights into their epidemiology, evolution, and public health impact.
