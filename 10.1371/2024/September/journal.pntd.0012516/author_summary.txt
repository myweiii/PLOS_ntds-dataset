Snakebite envenoming is a high-priority neglected tropical disease that largely affects poor, rural communities living in developing countries. Human-snake conflicts are a key trigger for snakebites, and they occur mainly due to urbanisation and the rise in pest populations leads to the migration of snakes into human-dominated environments. The removal of snakes and release of them into safe habitats is critical in mitigating the snakebite crisis and saving snakes. Snake rescuers play important roles in saving snakes and humans by safely removing snakes and often educating communities about the dangers of snakes and appropriate dos and donâ€™ts for snakebites. However, they face numerous challenges in rescuing snakes and most of their issues have not been brought to the attention of relevant authorities. In this study, we interviewed 152 snake rescuers in Tamil Nadu and highlighted their experiences, challenges and requirements in performing this task. The data demonstrate that most rescuers need certified training, recognition and identity cards from the government authorities, financial support for purchasing snake handling equipment and medical insurance for treatments if bitten by snakes and encouragement for them to be educators for snake conservation and snakebite mitigation. This study highlights the key challenges in rescuing snakes and appropriate recommendations to promote the safe rescue of snakes and the peaceful coexistence of snakes and humans.
