    "Abstract": "Environmental surveillance for Salmonella Typhi may provide information on the community-level dynamics of typhoid fever in resource poor regions experiencing high disease burden. Many knowledge gaps concerning the feasibility of ES remain, especially in areas lacking formal sewage systems. We implemented protocols for S. Typhi ES, including site selection and catchment population estimation, sample concentration and testing using qPCR for S. Typhi specific gene targets. Between May 2021 and May 2022, we collected grab samples and Moore swabs from 43 sites in Blantyre, Malawi. Catchment characteristics, water quality, and human faecal contamination (qPCR for Bacteroides HF183) were also recorded. Their association with S. Typhi detection was investigated using a logistic mixed-effects regression analysis. Prevalence of S. Typhi in ES samples was 2.1% (1.1\u20134.0%) and 3.9% (1.9\u20137.9%) for grab and Moore swab samples, respectively. HF183 was associated S. Typhi positivity, with a unit increase in log genome copies/microlitre increasing the odds of detection of S. Typhi by 1.56 (95% CI: 1.29\u20131.89) and 1.33 (1.10\u20131.61) in Moore swabs and grab samples, respectively. The location and timing of S. Typhi detection through ES was not associated with the incidence of typhoid fever reported in associated catchment populations. During this period of relatively low typhoid fever incidence, wastewater surveillance continued to detect S. Typhi in human sewage and wastewater suggesting that ES using natural river systems can be a sensitive indicator of transmission."
