Toscana virus (TOSV) is a reemerging sandfly-borne virus causing neuroinvasive infections in humans. This virus is endemic in the Mediterranean basin, with a potential risk of introduction in northern Europe and Asia. Despite decades of research, few studies have focused on the development cycle of TOSV in sand flies and the dynamics of transmission. Here, we provide a comprehensive study of the intra-vector dynamics of TOSV infection and its impact on both vector biology and consequently on transmission. Through experimental infections of the major vector Phlebotomus perniciosus, we not only brought additional experimental insights regarding vector competence but also provided the first insight into the TOSV developmental cycle in the vector by estimating the extrinsic incubation period at six days. Our study reveals an impact of TOSV infection on vector egg hatching time that could lead to a delayed emergence of infected sand flies, with a potential impact on transmission. Our findings encourage further exploration of transmission dynamics, raise new hypotheses on alternative transmission pathways, and emphasize the importance of follow-up studies.
