    "Abstract": "Toscana virus (TOSV) is a leading cause of summer viral meningitis in Southern Europe (Central Italy, south of France, Spain and Portugal) and can cause severe neurological cases. Within the Mediterranean basin, it is transmitted by hematophagous sand flies belonging to the Phlebotomus genus. Despite the identification of the primary TOSV vectors, the viral developmental cycle in vector species remains largely unknown. Limited research has been conducted on transmission dynamics and the vector competence and vectorial capacity of the principal TOSV vector, Phlebotomus perniciosus. In this context, we investigated the intra-vector TOSV infection dynamics in Ph. perniciosus, as well as its impact on the vector life history traits. Female sand flies were experimentally infected with TOSV through an artificial blood meal. Systemic dissemination of the virus was observed approximately three days post-infection, potentially resulting in a short extrinsic incubation period. Moreover, the study revealed a longer hatching time for eggs laid by infected females. This research brought additional experimental insights regarding the vector competence of Ph. perniciosus but also provided the first insight into TOSV developmental cycle and its impact on the vector. These findings prompt further exploration of TOSV transmission dynamics, raise new hypotheses on the virus transmission and highlight the importance of follow-up studies."
