Skin infections (tinea and scabies) are significant health concerns among the indigenous Negrito communities in Peninsular Malaysia. Given that there was only one documented study among Negrito communities previously, the present study enrolled 361 participants from eight Negrito categorised into resettled or inland villages in Peninsular Malaysia to update the epidemiological status and risk factors. We found a high overall skin infection prevalence of 35.6%. Scabies, tinea versicolor, and tinea imbricata accounted for 11.7%, 11.3%, and 7.5%, respectively with no co-infection. Higher prevalence was observed among resettled villages (55.2%) compared to inland villages (24.8%). Risk factor analysis among these Negrito communities identified different predictors associated with each type of infection, generally linked to the type of village category. We highlighted that scabies and tinea versicolor were more common in resettled communities. However, rare infection like tinea imbricata, which require high treatment compliance, was more localized in inland villages. Village-specific measures including regular medical interventions in inland villages and socio-economic aid to resettled communities to address urban/semi-urban poverty are essential, considering the existing predisposition of skin infections in different types of villages.
