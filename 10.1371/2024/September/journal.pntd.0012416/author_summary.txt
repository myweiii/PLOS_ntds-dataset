Soil surveillance to determine soil-transmitted helminth (STH) prevalence in communities with MDA programs could be cost-effective. Though microscopic methods for the detection of STH in soil exist, they are laborious. With recent increased availability of DNA extraction kits and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents, using molecular assays are promising and provide the ability to discriminate between closely related helminth species. In this study, we developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for the detection of STH in large quantities of soil and field-tested it in three countries.
