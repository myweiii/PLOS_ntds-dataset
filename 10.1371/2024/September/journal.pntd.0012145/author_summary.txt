Talaromyces marneffei invades host macrophages to establish infection. Major stressors inside the macrophage compartments are nutrient deprivation and oxidative substances. Here, we demonstrated that AcuK and AcuM transcription factors are necessary for T. marneffei to grow under iron and glucose limitation, and to survive oxidative stress and macrophage killing. AcuK and AcuM regulate non-glucose carbon utilization via the transcriptional control of gluconeogenic genes. For iron homeostasis, the two proteins regulate the expression of genes involved in iron-utilization pathways. Lastly, the AcuK and AcuM play a role in oxidative stress response likely by regulating the expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and alternative respiration enzymes. Thus, AcuK and AcuM control multiple cellular adaptations that allow T. marneffei to cope with major stressors occurring during macrophage infection. Since AcuK and AcuM are critical for cellular metabolism and macrophage engulfment, this new information could lead to a better understanding of host-pathogen interaction and could be ultimately developed into fungal-specific diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents.
