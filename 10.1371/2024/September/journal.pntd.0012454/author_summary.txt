Glycosylation, the process of adding and removing sugar molecules from proteins, lipids, and small RNAs, plays a crucial role in numerous biological processes. Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease affecting 6 to 8 million people globally, significantly alters the sialylation of host cell glycoproteins. In mammals, the enzyme ST8Sia2 is involved in forming polysialic acid (polySia), primarily studied in the nervous system, yet its role in infectious diseases remains poorly understood. In our study, we found that T. cruzi infection reduces the expression of ST8Sia2 in host cells, leading to decreased levels of polySia. This reduction also affects key proteins such as NCAM1 and SCN5A. Furthermore, experiments involving the removal of polySia, chemical inhibition of ST8Sia2, or genetic silencing of the enzyme resulted in increased intracellular parasites numbers. We propose that altering host polysialylation may induce oxidative stress, thereby favoring T. cruzi survival and infection. Our findings suggest that inhibiting ST8Sia2 enhances T. cruzi infection, providing new insights into Chagas disease mechanisms and highlighting the important role of host polysialylation.
