Dengue poses a serious global health threat, particularly in tropical regions like Bangladesh. Effective prevention and control depend on accurately mapping high-risk (hotspots) and low-risk (coldspots) areas. Using sequential spatial analysis, this study revealed a concerning rise in dengue cases, with a total of 513,344 reported of the study periods. The case fatality rate also increased, rising from 0.16% in 2019 to 0.5% in 2023. Initially, Dhaka city bore the highest burden, accounting for over half of the cases in 2019. However, a worrying shift emerged in 2023. Cases surged nationwide, with geographical coverage peaking in Julyâ€“three months earlier than the typical October peak observed in 2022. This surge achieved complete geographic coverage, unlike the previous year. Spatial analysis indicated a strong spatial dependence of the disease, with trends stabilizing in 2023 compared to previous years. The study identified persistent hotspots in Bagerhat, Barisal, and Faridpur districts, while Dinajpur, Gaibandha, Nilphamari, Rangpur, and Sylhet districts emerged as coldspots. The southeast and central regions consistently showed high dengue rates. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of dengue transmission in Bangladesh, emphasizing the need for adaptable public health strategies and targeted interventions.
