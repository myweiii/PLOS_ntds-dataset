This research assessed the usefulness of a computer-based education tool for Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis to train community health workers in Rwanda. The knowledge of health workers on the disease was assessed before the training, immediately after training, and four weeks later to determine baseline knowledge, knowledge uptake, and retention, respectively. The participantsâ€™ scores showed a significant improvement in knowledge immediately after the training. Four weeks later, the evaluation showed maintenance of the knowledge for at least the short term. Although digital literacy and lack of smartphones/computer to use the tool was noted as the main challenge, the participants highlighted the structure, completeness, and clarity of the information in the tool, recommending it be used in other areas.
