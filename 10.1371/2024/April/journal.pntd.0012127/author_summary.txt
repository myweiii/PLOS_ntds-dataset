Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected disease recognized for causing ulcers distributed throughout the body; such ulcers can be disfiguring and may intrinsically attract a social stigma. Furthermore, the currently available therapeutic arsenal is admittedly limited and associated with significant toxicity. Long therapeutic regimens and parenteral administration have been considered in recent years as a strategy to be replaced. In this scenario, the search for new treatment alternatives for CL is considered a priority by the World Health Organization, which has been expanding its treatment recommendations with alternatives for local use. In this study, we performed an extensive literature search to gather evidence on the efficacy of amphotericin B (AmB) in local administration for the treatment of CL in preclinical or clinical studies. In total, 21 studies, 16 preclinical studies and five clinical studies were identified. The global cure rate for clinical studies addressing intralesional infiltration and topical application was estimated at 56.9% (CI: 41.1â€“71.4%). High heterogeneity in the design, groups, and route of administration of AmB among studies was observed, requiring caution in interpreting and extrapolating of this pooled rate. In summary, the results show that local routes of administration of AmB are a promising strategy and need to be evaluated in studies with adequate design, enabling the expansion of therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of CL.
