Chagas disease, a severe parasitic illness prevalent in Latin America, poses significant challenges due to delayed detection and treatment. Machine learning algorithms, advanced computer programs, have emerged as valuable tools for disease prediction and diagnosis. In our study, we utilized these algorithms to forecast Chagas disease risk based on factors such as age, gender, and living conditions. Drawing on data from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS), we trained five algorithms, with one showing promising results, achieving an impressive score of 0.772 out of 1. By establishing a specific threshold, we could potentially reduce testing costs while maintaining high detection rates. This research highlights the potential of machine learning in improving Chagas disease diagnosis and prevention by incorporating socio-demographic and environmental factors. Integrating these elements into predictive models has the potential to enhance their effectiveness and sensitivity, thereby improving disease management outcomes and ultimately reducing the burden of Chagas disease in affected regions.
