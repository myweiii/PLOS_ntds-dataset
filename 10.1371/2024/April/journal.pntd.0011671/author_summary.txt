People around the world interact with a wide range of animals, but one of the closest is the domestic dog. Dogs can be reservoirs of several zoonotic infectious diseases, including leptospirosis. The frequent ecological interactions between people, dogs, and wildlife in indigenous communities living in the Amazon basin might increase the complexity of leptospirosis transmission, in comparison with what has been described for other settings. In the Amazon basin, wild animals and domestic animals may act as reservoirs of the pathogen, excreting the bacteria through their urine. In this work, we analyzed serum and urine samples from dogs living within Kichwa communities from the Yasun√≠ National Park in Ecuador. Serum samples were analyzed with MAT and urine samples with qPCR assays that detect the presence of pathogenic Leptospira. Our results suggest that a high percentage of dogs have been exposed to Leptospira. We identified the presence of ten serovars and three different Leptospira species. These findings provide important insights into the epidemiology of leptospirosis in this ecosystem, showing that dogs are a common reservoir and thus likely to play a critical role in the transmission of the disease.
