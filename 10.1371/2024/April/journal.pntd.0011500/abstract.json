    "Background": "The exposure to parasites may influence the immune response to vaccines in endemic African countries. In this study, we aimed to assess the association between helminth exposure to the most prevalent parasitic infections, schistosomiasis, soil transmitted helminths infection and filariasis, and the Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV GP) antibody concentration in response to vaccination with the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen in African and European participants using samples obtained from three international clinical trials.",
    "Methods/Principal findings": "We conducted a study in a subset of participants in the EBL2001, EBL2002 and EBL3001 clinical trials that evaluated the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen against EVD in children, adolescents and adults from the United Kingdom, France, Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Uganda and Sierra Leone. Immune markers of helminth exposure at baseline were evaluated by ELISA with three commercial kits which detect IgG antibodies against schistosome, filarial and Strongyloides antigens. Luminex technology was used to measure inflammatory and activation markers, and Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines at baseline. The association between binding IgG antibodies specific to EBOV GP (measured on day 21 post-dose 2 and on Day 365 after the first dose respectively), and helminth exposure at baseline was evaluated using a multivariable linear regression model adjusted for age and study group.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "No clear association was found between immune markers of helminth exposure as measured by ELISA and post-vaccination response to the Ebola Ad26.ZEBOV/ MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen.",
    "Trial registration": "NCT02416453, NCT02564523, NCT02509494. ClinicalTrials.gov."
