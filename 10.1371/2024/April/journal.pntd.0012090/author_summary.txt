Trachoma, a chronic ocular infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading infectious cause of blindness globally. The full SAFE strategy is implemented by affected countries to eliminate trachoma; Surgery (for trichiasis), Antibiotics (to reduce the community pool of infection, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement (to decrease transmission). However, there is no accepted measure of facial cleanliness that programs can use to chart progress in improving hygiene. This study compared two possible metrics for facial cleanliness, observing a clean face and observing dirt on a facial wipe.
A clean face was defined as observed absence of ocular and nasal discharge on the face or observing a low grade of dirtiness (scale 10 = white to 0 = black) on a standard facial wipe. The reliability of grading a childâ€™s face or grading a facial wipe was determined in children in Kongwa Tanzania. Both measurements were equally reliable. We tested both measures in a cohort of 202 children ages 1 to <7years prior to face cleaning, immediately afterwards, and 4 hours afterwards. There was no correlation between the two. Both measures detected facial cleaning immediately after cleaning, compared to control children who were not cleaned; control (uncleaned) had 53% clean faces and wipe score of 6.7 compared to cleaned children with 88% clean faces and wipe score of 8 (p = .0001, p = < .0001, respectively). Both measures also detected face washing 4 hours previously compared to controls.
The two metrics were equally reliable, and both measured the behavior of face washing. They measure different aspects of a clean face; one measures dirtiness and the other measures potentially infected ocular and nasal discharge. Both measurements appear to capture the behavior of facial cleaning, and the choice of metric would appear to rest on the measurement that captures the stated objective of the behavior, consideration of costs, training, logistics, and implementation.
