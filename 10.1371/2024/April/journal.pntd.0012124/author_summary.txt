Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected tropical disease affecting 21 Latin American countries. Transmission occurs through the bite of infected bugs, blood and organ transfusions, mother-to-child transmission, and contaminated food. The disease progresses through acute there most patients are asymptomatic, or a chronic phase where around 60–70% show no symptoms for 10–30 years or life, but some may progress to a serious cardiac or digestive form. In this study, we analyze the geographical and temporal distribution of hospitalizations for chronic CD.
We utilized the national database of hospitalizations for public and private hospitals. A total of 527 hospitalized patients were observed between 2010 and 2020, corresponding to 624 hospitalizations. Our findings revealed that hospitalizations are concentrated in the northern zone and have slightly decreased over the years. The most frequent diagnosis was chronic Chagas disease (CD) with digestive system involvement (55.8%) compared to cardiac diagnosis (44.2%). However, the risk of in-hospital mortality was higher for CD with cardiac involvement, increasing with age. Meanwhile, a chronic digestive diagnosis and male sex pose a higher risk of undergoing surgery.
