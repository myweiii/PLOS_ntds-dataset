We thank all doctors, nurses, and all other staff at the Department of Internal Medicine and the Department of Pediatrics at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, for their contribution to the study. We equally thank the technicians and all other staff of the Pathology Laboratory Department at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital who facilitated and contributed to the study. We are also grateful the support by Merriam Sundberg-Amargo and Harald Landa for their help in preparing the shipment of material from Norway to Zanzibar as well as by Inger Marie Brend Johansen, Mette Voldhaug and Tone Kofstad for the further analysis of the strains, all from the Department of Microbiology at Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Norway.
The Illumina sequencing service of the study strains was provided by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (www.sequencing.uio.no), a national technology platform hosted by Oslo University Hospital and the University of Oslo, supported by the "Research Council of Norway and the Southeastern Regional Health Authorities" and, for the three isolates of the pilot study, by Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway.
The Illumina short read sequencing of three strains of the pilot study as well as the MinION sequencing (six strains of the main study and three strains of the pilot study) was provided by Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway.
Jessin J. J. Peter, University of Tromsø, Norway, performed a first analysis of the WGS data.
Thank you to R. S. Hendriksen, Technical University of Denmark, regarding the advice for the analysis by long read sequencing (MinION).
