Since 2004, when only surgery was available, Buruli ulcer (BU) treatment has improved reaching to the efficient 8-weeks all oral antibiotic course of rifampicin and clarithromycin together with wound care and, sometimes, tissue grafting and surgery. This skin neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans mainly affects people living in rural areas in under-resourced countries with limited access to health services and medicines, thus compromising patientsâ€™ treatment adherence. The inclusion of amoxicillin/clavulanate in BU therapy was previously described in vitro with the potential to shorten BU treatment.
In this study, we confirmed the high bactericidal activity over time of rifampicin and amoxicillin/clavulanate-containing combinations against M. ulcerans, being even more effective in vitro than the antibiotic combination currently used to treat BU. A comparison of different methodologies that are applied in the laboratory and in the clinic showed good correlation between them, leading to a wide variety of biomarkers for BU research and giving the opportunity for clinical translation; the choice of the most suitable one being driven by the purpose and the context of the study. These in vitro data provide further support to the ongoing clinical trial in West Africa to evaluate if BU treatment can be shortened from 8 to 4 weeks (BLMs4BU trial: NCT05169554, PACTR202209521256638).
