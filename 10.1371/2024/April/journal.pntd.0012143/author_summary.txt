Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide and is largely confined to low- and middle-income countries. It is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a contagious intracellular bacterium. The World Health Organization recommends mass drug administration (MDA) with the antibiotic azithromycin for treatment of ocular Ct infections, alongside improving facial cleanliness and environmental conditions to reduce transmission. In most regions MDA is successfully reducing trachoma prevalence to the point where it is no longer a public health issue, however in some areas trachoma persists despite multiple years of interventions. To investigate why trachoma persists, especially in the context of MDA and transmission dynamics, the identification of Ct sequence types may aid in understanding and gauge progress of trachoma control. Our study applies a Ct typing system new to trachoma, which augments the standard method by adding three loci with high mutation rates. Results show that the typing system was able to discriminate between variants with greater resolution than the standard method, and was both cost-effective and more efficient relative to the gold-standard of whole genome sequencing. The findings suggest that this novel method is a reliable tool for typing ocular Ct, which can aid in the development of targeted interventions for trachoma control through improved understanding of Ct transmission.
