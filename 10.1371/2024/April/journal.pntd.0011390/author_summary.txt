The majority of zoonoses originate in wildlife and tend to emerge from biodiverse regions in low to middle income countries, frequently among deprived populations of at-risk people with a lack of access to diagnostic capacity or surveillance. Diseases such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease and Lassa fever are viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) and rank among the most neglected and serious threats to global public health. This threat is partly due to the severity of disease caused by these pathogens, but also because their geographical distribution is close to human populations with often limited access to medical or diagnostic laboratory services. In our study we describe techniques for PCR based detection of five VHF viruses using a synthetic, multi-target non-infectious positive control. Our work has applications in assay design and optimization, particularly where access to source material is problematic or requires high level biosafety containment, as is the case with VHF viruses. This approach can help learners train in techniques used in nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and sequencing of VHF viruses and can be used for any targets, with potential for multiplexing from a single positive control.
