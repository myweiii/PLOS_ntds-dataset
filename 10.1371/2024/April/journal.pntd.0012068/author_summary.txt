Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging epidemic infectious disease with high mortality rate. However, the prevalence of liver injury and its association with the prognosis of SFTS patients has not been well characterized. In this multi-center cohort study, we found that the incidence of liver injury in non-survivors was significantly higher than that in survivors both at admission and during hospitalization. Patients with liver injury at admission had higher cumulative mortality risk than those without liver injury. Our study demonstrated that the presence of liver injury is strongly associated with poor prognosis in SFTS patients. Liver function should be closely monitored in SFTS patients, which may contribute to better management of SFTS.
