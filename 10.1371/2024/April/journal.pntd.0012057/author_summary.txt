Snakebite envenoming is a pervasive global health concern, posing substantial risks, particularly in less developed regions. The intricate variations in venom composition within a single species have been well-documented, contributing significantly to the varied clinical effects experienced by envenomed patients. It is imperative to unravel these variations, as they are pivotal in the formulation of effective snakebite management strategies and the development of targeted antivenom therapies.
In this study, our focus rested on the venom of the Naja mossambica species, dwelling in diverse African regions. Our objective was to delve into the toxin composition of these venoms and understand how these toxins interact with commercially available antivenoms. This exploration was aimed to uncover which toxins, despite antivenom application, evade neutralization. This information becomes a cornerstone in the design of more potent and efficacious antivenoms, contributing to a nuanced approach in combating the complex landscape of snakebite envenoming.
