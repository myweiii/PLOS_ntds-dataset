Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of diseases that usually affect the most vulnerable population in tropical countries. Mozambique has been tackling lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths for two decades with the aim of eliminating them through large-scale distribution of drugs to interrupt transmission. In recent years, internal conflict has emerged and led to an escalating humanitarian crisis in the endemic province of Cabo Delgado which has hampered elimination efforts. This study aimed to shed light on the situation and to determine the potential impact on the Mozambique NTDs’ programme.
We used a range of open-source data on NTDs, conflict, internally displaced persons and geographical access to summarise, describe, and map the situation at the district level in the most affected province. We used this data to also examine their geographical overlap and to develop a risk assessment tool to highlight the high risk and most vulnerable areas. We found that between 2020–2022 more than 1,300 conflict incidents occurred, and almost 1 million people were displaced in Cabo Delgado province with many districts having limited geographical access which impacted the NTDs programme’s ability to work.
The study highlights the important challenges of conflict and displacement of vulnerable populations, and the need for support and set of guidelines for NTDs endemic programmes to use to help to overcome key barriers and meet the targets of elimination set by the World Health Organization for 2030.
