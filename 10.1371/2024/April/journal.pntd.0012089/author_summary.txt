Rabies is a fatal zoonotic viral disease. Dog vaccination is recognized as the most cost-effective and sustainable solution to rabies prevention. Cambodia is endemic with canine mediated rabies, that would cause to around 800 human death each year. This country also has a large owned but mostly free-roaming dog population that makes efficient massive vaccination hard to achieve. In this study, we vaccinated 351 dogs with or without booster one year later. We then used serological assessed the short and long-term vaccination-induced immunity in these dogs, and Bayesian modeling to identify a vaccination strategy adapted to the Cambodian dog population characteristics. Yearly primary vaccinations for young dogs, supplemented with a single booster injection of these dogs promises to achieve 70% dog vaccination coverage effectively and efficiently, and control rabies circulation in dog populations. Applying this new strategy running for five more years after the vaccination coverage of at least 70% is achieved, this implies per 1,000 dogs between 2000 and 5 000 saved vaccine doses depending on dog population characteristics. Our results could help controlling rabies in Cambodia and potentially be adopted by other countries facing similar challenges.
