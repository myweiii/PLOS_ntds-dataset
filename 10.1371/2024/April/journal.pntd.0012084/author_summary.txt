This study aims to discern whether there are variations in the clinical manifestations and outcomes of severe Leptospirosis between tropical and non-tropical regions with comparable healthcare infrastructures. Conducted in France, the research scrutinizes the distinctions in patient characteristics, clinical presentations, and prognoses between a tropical area and a temperate one. The analysis reveals minimal discrepancies in patient profiles and clinical patterns across these regions. Additionally, no statistically significant differences were observed regarding the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital stays, as well as ICU or hospital mortality rates, between the tropical and non-tropical locales. The findings suggest that the clinical features and outcomes of individuals afflicted with severe leptospirosis exhibit substantial uniformity across tropical and temperate regions endowed with similar healthcare resources. This study contributes valuable insights into the understanding of leptospirosis, highlighting the consistency in disease presentation and prognosis irrespective of climatic distinctions, given comparable healthcare capabilities.
