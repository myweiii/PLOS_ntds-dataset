Our study investigates how the global shipping network inadvertently serves as a highway for the spread of two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, both of which are vectors for pathogens causing diseases like dengue and Zika. We analyzed maritime movement data in the United States Gulf Coast and found that the more cargo ships that dock at a port, the higher the chance these mosquitoes will be introduced; nearly all cargo ships arriving at these ports had last visited regions where these mosquitoes thrive, significantly raising the risk of spread of these mosquitoes. Our research also suggested that proactive detection and elimination of mosquitoes from shipping containers can dramatically lower the risk of these pests establishing new colonies, even as global shipping traffic grows. Our work suggests that by enhancing surveillance and control measures at strategic points in the shipping process, we can safeguard our communities from additional mosquito introductions.
