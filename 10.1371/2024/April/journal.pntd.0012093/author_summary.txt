Stigma related to Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) constitutes a burden on the social and economic life of affected people, their caregivers and communities. Current evidence on stigma has been limited to a small number of NTDs. The WHO recommends integration approaches to NTDs are therefore understanding stigma and its differential impact is important. We explored stigma experiences, effects and coping strategies simultaneously in BU and yaws in two districts in central Ghana. Findings showed nuances for macro-level stigma associated with BU; individuals were stigmatized by community members; interestingly, this was not noted for yaws. Negative effects of stigma found included psychosocial burden, effects on academic work and straining of social relationships. Some affected individuals dealt with the source of stigma actively avoiding disclosure, selective disclosure, concealment with clothing and confrontation. Emotion-focused strategies such as religious coping and self-isolation were reported; these were noted to aggravate psychosocial problems being experienced by affected people. We propose that, the differences in stigma among people affected by BU and yaws, and the role of age in determining types of stigma identified in this study should be considered in integrated interventions for skin NTDs. School health programs are encouraged to educate teachers about skin NTDs and the negative effects of stigma on students.
