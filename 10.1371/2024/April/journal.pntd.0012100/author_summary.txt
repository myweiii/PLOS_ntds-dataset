From 2015 onward, Zika virus (ZKV) caused major epidemics in Brazil and other South American countries, where many children were born with congenital problems, such as microcephaly, as a result of infections in pregnant women. Additionally, many cases of Guillain Barr√© Syndrome in adults were also caused by infections with the virus. Detection of ZKV infection is, therefore, very important; nonetheless, most patients infected by ZKV develop either no symptoms or symptoms that are not distinguishable from diseases caused by other co-circulating arboviruses, including dengue. To complicate matters, Zika, and dengue viruses show intense genetic resemblance, and serological diagnosis presents high levels of uncertainty due to extensive cross-reactivity. In this work, we developed proteins to serologically differentiate Zika from dengue infections with no or minimum cross-reactivity. We produced three multiepitope, recombinant proteins which were able to differentiate zika-positive samples from dengue-positive sera. The tests employing the recombinant proteins had high sensitivity and specificity, especially in the case of ZIKV-1 and ZIKV-2 proteins, whilst the ZIKV-3 protein was less efficient. The recombinant proteins showed clear potential to be used as diagnostic tools for detecting antibodies against ZIKV infections with no cross-reactivity to other prevalent arbovirus.
