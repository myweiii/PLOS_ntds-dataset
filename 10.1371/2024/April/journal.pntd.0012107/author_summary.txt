Clonorchis sinensis is one of the most important foodborne zoonotic parasites, affecting over 15 million people worldwide. However, the low-intensity infection and the lack of instant detection methods remain the main inhibitory factors for controlling this disease. In this study, the specific CSTR1 antigen was combined with EuNPs to construct a fluorescent probe to capture clonorchiasis-specific antibodies. Then, the complex binds to anti-human IgG immobilized on the test line, producing a fluorescent signal under UV light. The established EuNPs-FIA method enabled both qualitative determination with the naked eye and quantitative detection by scanning fluorescence probes intensity. The FIA has no cross-reaction with other 9 heterologous samples, and the sensitivity tests showed that the serum sample corresponding to 24 eggs per gram (EPG) in KK method can be still detected. Our work indicated that the established EuNPs-FIA method has broad application prospects in clinical and epidemiological studies and can aid in the surveillance and control of clonorchiasis.
