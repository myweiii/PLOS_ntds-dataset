Leishmaniasis is a zoonosis caused by the intracellular parasite of the genus Leishmania. In the Mediterranean region, the human disease can be present mainly in two forms: cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which can be fatal if untreated. The clinical presentation of the disease depends on the parasite species and host characteristics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the visceral form of leishmaniasis are not yet fully understood. In this study, we have determined the gene expression profile in cells infected by three Leishmania species (L. infantum, L. major, L. tropica) responsible for different forms of the disease. The results have allowed us to identify an expression profile (and the related pathways) shared by cells infected by all Leishmania species. Aside this common response, we also identified a transcriptional response distinguishing cells infected by L. infantum, L. major or L. tropica, as well as the relevant pathways in which these genes participate. Therefore, our results contribute to the knowledge of the host cell mechanisms that are activated along infection with different Leishmania species causing different forms of the disease and, therefore, may help develop new host-directed therapy for Leishmaniasis.
