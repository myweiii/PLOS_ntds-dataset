Dengue transmission is hyperendemic in coastal Ecuador. However, there is limited understanding of how exposure to Aedes aegypti vectors varies at the neighbourhood-level and in response to local micro-climatic conditions. Here, we investigated how the abundance and resting behaviour (use of indoor versus peri-domestic sites) of Ae. aegypti varied within and between 2 coastal urban settings, Portoviejo and Quinindé cantons. Additionally we tested for associations between Aedes abundance and dengue case incidence. We found that the abundance of Ae. aegypti and their preference for indoor resting sites varied between the two study sites. Vectors were more abundant in urban than in peri-urban neighbourhoods at both sites. Associations between Ae. aegypti abundance and “city-wide” dengue incidence were highly variable depending on the trapping method used; with collections made in peri-domestic settings (BG sentinel traps and Prokopack aspiration) showing a positive association with incidence in contrast to indoor Prokopack aspirations. These results emphasize the need for fine-scale vector surveillance at the neighbourhood-level to identify hotspots of Aedes abundance and optimize vector control strategies.
