Schistosomiasis is a snail-borne disease of great public health importance. Since drug treatment does not suffice to control the disease, the World Health Organisation now recommends including snail control and community involvement. Here we demonstrate how local inhabitants of an endemic region, after training, can detect snail populations with acceptable accuracy, at significantly lower cost. This citizen science approach could therefore generate unprecedented datasets in terms of spatiotemporal resolution and coverage. Moreover, it empowers communities and increases knowledge on snail-borne diseases and their control and prevention. We therefore argue that this community-based approach presents a valuable and sustainable compliment to classical surveillance programs, especially in remote areas, thereby generating the much-anticipated data and community support for targeted snail control.
