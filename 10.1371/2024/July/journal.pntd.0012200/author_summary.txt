Snake bites are a particular public health concern worldwide. Compared to other parts of the world, the available data on snake bites in the Eastern Mediterranean Region–a region spanning large parts of North Africa and the Middle East all the way to Pakistan and Afghanistan–is relatively weak. Without reliable data it is difficult to make the case for greater visibility and investments to address snakebite burden in the Region. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted the first scoping review to summarize evidence on snake bites from all 22 countries of the Eastern Mediterranean. Despite identifying 196 publications, we found that evidence was concentrated in a few countries and remained limited or absent for most of the Region. Moreover, a significant proportion of publications lacked information on long-term health consequences, snake species involved, and types and sources of antivenoms used. Our review highlights the need to improve data collection on snakebite burden as part of routine health information systems and community-based surveillance, and to address disability in future research. Additionally, findings suggest that some countries need to review their procurement practices of antivenoms to ensure availability and use of appropriate quality products in the future.
