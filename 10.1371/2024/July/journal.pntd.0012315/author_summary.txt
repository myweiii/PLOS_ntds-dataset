The Chinese liver fluke C. sinensis is a fish-borne trematode that causes serious biliary diseases and complications, such as cholangiocarcinoma. Living in an anaerobic environment, C. sinensis adults consume large amounts of exogenous glucose and produce energy and intermediate products via glycolytic pathways. We identified four glucose transporters (CsGTP1â€“4) and one sodium glucose co-transporter (CsSGLT) in C. sinensis and their glucose transport mechanism was investigated. This is the first study to report SGLT in a helminthic parasite, particularly trematodes. Elucidating the structure and function of CsGTPs, CsSGLT, and their inhibitors may lead to strategies to exhaust glucose and ultimately starve C. sinensis. This study provides fundamental information on the glucose transporters of helminths and may shed light on directions for studying energy metabolism in other mammalian-infecting trematodes.
