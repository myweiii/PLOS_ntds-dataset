Modification of the landscape and ecosystems is tightly linked with the transmission of zoonotic and vector-biorne diseases, with crucial consequences on public health. We reviewed the published literature (2015â€“2024) on the most frequent vectors, reservoirs and hosts, the prevalent infections, as well as the factors associated with transmission risk and the anthropogenic landscape modification in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. The most relevant pathogens of zoonotic risk included Trypanosoma cruzi, arboviruses, Leishmania, Rickettsia, Leptospira, and Toxoplasma gondii. Our summary suggests that prevalence is higher in deforested areas and agricultural aggregates, and in sites with precarious health and infrastructure services. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of zoonotic agents in the peninsula highlights the need to better understand the impact of land use changes on zoonoses.
