In our study, we aimed to improve the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis, a parasitic infection that is often difficult to detect with current methods. Traditional parasitological and molecular techniques have limitations in sensitivity, making it challenging to accurately diagnose this condition. To address this, we designed a new diagnostic tool using a chimeric recombinant antigen, combining two specific antigens from the parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. We used advanced bioinformatics to select the most immunogenic regions of these antigens, ensuring they did not overlap with other parasite proteins. This chimeric antigen was then produced and tested for its diagnostic performance in an ELISA system. Our results showed that the new chimeric antigen is both soluble and highly antigenic; meaning it effectively triggers an immune response. When tested with sera samples from patients with strongyloidiasis, the ELISA system using our chimeric antigen demonstrated high sensitivity (93.94%) and specificity (97.22%), indicating it could accurately identify infected individuals.
These findings are promising, suggesting that our chimeric antigen could be a valuable tool for diagnosing strongyloidiasis. However, further research with a larger sample size is needed to confirm its effectiveness. If validated, this new diagnostic approach could significantly improve the detection and management of this neglected parasitic infection, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.
