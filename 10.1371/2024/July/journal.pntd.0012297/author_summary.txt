Understanding the viruses capable of human infection is important for outbreak prevention and early intervention in viral epidemics. Le Dantec virus (LDV) is a member of the viral genus Ledantevirus (Rhabodoviridae) and has previously been isolated only once previously in a child with febrile illness in Senegal in 1965. We detected the genome of LDV in blood sampled from a patient presenting with febrile illness in Western Uganda in 2012. To estimate the extent to which LDV may be causing human infection in the region, we tested stored blood samples collected in 2016 for evidence of antibodies to LDV, revealing that up to 76% of Ugandans in some areas had previously been exposed to either to LDV or a closely related virus. Seroprevalence was highest in Western Uganda, an area of high biodiversity where several other ledanteviruses have been isolated in association with ectoparasites of bats. To investigate potential ecological reservoirs of zoonotic viruses we tested blood from wild rodents inhabiting areas close to human settlements. We detected a new ledantevirus, closely related to LDV, in blood from a wild rodent Mastomys erythroleucus. Our work shows that ledanteviruses are a common cause of human infection in Uganda.
