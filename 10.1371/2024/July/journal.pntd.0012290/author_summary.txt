Horses and donkeys seem to be infected by Leishmania infantum, causative agent of canine leishmaniasis (CanL), which is one of the most important zoonotic vector-borne disease. Moreover, Leishmania martiniquensis, causing visceral and mucocutaneus leishmaniasis in humans, was reported in horses from central Europe. Therefore, we designed this study to investigate the circulation of both Leishmania zoonotic species among equids living in CanL endemic areas and to access the presence of dipteran vectors from the same habitats. Horses and donkeys (n = 98) were sampled and analyzed for Leishmania spp., as well as sand flies and biting midges. Nineteen equids (19.4%) scored seropositive by immunofluorescence antibody test for L. infantum and one donkey and one horse, presenting skin lesions, scored molecularly positive for Leishmania spp. Twelve sand flies and one biting midge were positive for Leishmania spp. DNA. Overall, data herein presented suggest that equids living in CanL endemic areas are exposed to Leishmania spp., potentially contributing to the circulation of the parasite.
