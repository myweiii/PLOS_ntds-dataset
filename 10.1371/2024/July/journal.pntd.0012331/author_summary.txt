Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are prevalent in tropical rainforest regions of southern Thailand, where frequent rainfall can enhance the environmental life cycle of STHs, leading to reinfection. To mitigate this, we implemented control measures during the dry season from 2012 to 2016, aiming to reduce reinfection rates. For STH detection, we used agar plate culture and the Kato-Katz methods to analyze stool samples collected from 299 participants. Only those who tested positive for STHs received a single dose of albendazole, without accompanying health education, sanitation, or hygiene interventions. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated three weeks later. Follow-up assessments were conducted in 2013 and 2016 without further administration of albendazole. In 2013, a year after the albendazole treatment, there was a decrease in the prevalence of all STHs, except for trichuriasis. Unexpectedly, the El Niño event from 2014–2016 triggered prolonged droughts from 2014 to 2015, which likely led to a reduction in the prevalence and intensity of all STHs, excluding S. stercoralis. This exception was due to its low natural cure rate (NCR), as it can reproduce within the host. Additionally, the drought likely led to a reduction in the reinfection rate and an increase in the NCR. Notably, the NCR of trichuriasis induced by drought was more significant than that achieved through albendazole treatment. Furthermore, participants infected with hookworm or T. trichiura who were not cured by albendazole experienced natural remission. Improvements in sanitation and hygiene also likely contributed to the decreased prevalence of STHs. Based on these findings, we recommend that the control of STHs, especially in tropical rainforests characterized by long rainy seasons and persistently wet soil, should be strategically timed during the dry season to optimize effectiveness.
