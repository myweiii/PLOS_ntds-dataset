Enteric fever is a major health problem in Indonesia. Blood culture, the gold standard for enteric fever diagnosis, is expensive and requires several days to produce a result, leading to diagnoses being made through rapid tests such as TUBEX TF in Indonesia and other LMICs. In a real-world setting, we found that TUBEX TF over-diagnosed enteric fever by more than 50% in comparison to blood culture and PCR. Over-diagnosis may result in over-treatment and the subsequent increase of antimicrobial resistance. Given the suboptimal performance of TUBEX TF, the use of readily available clinical and laboratory data to facilitate identification of enteric fever cases has been considered. In our study, the majority of enteric fever patients were school-aged children. Although non-specific, gradually increasing fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cough were often present; hematologic parameters did not distinguish enteric fever from other etiologies. Interestingly, diagnostic accuracy was better by S. Typhi IgM and best by S. Typhi IgG in acute specimens. These findings may reflect the inaccuracy or subjectivity of TUBEX TF. The surprisingly excellent performance of S. Typhi IgG ELISA merits further evaluation.
