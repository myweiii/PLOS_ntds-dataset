Bone and joint infections (BJI) are a recognised and life-threatening manifestation of melioidosis but frequently only one component of multi-organ involvement. Almost all patients with BJI due to Burkholderia pseudomallei have risk factors that predispose them to developing melioidosis, but diabetes appears to be the most closely associated with BJI. The vasculopathy, neuropathy, structural deformity and decreased immunity that is seen in many individuals with diabetes increases their risk of lower limb infection and these factors–combined with greater exposure to B. pseudomallei in the soil and surface water–might explain the lower limb predominance that is seen in many series of melioidosis-related BJI. Patients require early multimodal imaging, appropriate microbiological sampling, early surgical review, prompt source control and an adequate duration of antibiotic therapy–and, in many cases, critical care support–to ensure optimal outcomes. Collaborative, multidisciplinary care reduces the case-fatality rate of melioidosis BJI, but recrudescence, relapse and orthopaedic complications are common in survivors and therefore extended patient follow up is essential.
