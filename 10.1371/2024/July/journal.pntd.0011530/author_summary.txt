Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic worms and it is contracted through contact with contaminated water. FGS is a long-term consequence of urogenital schistosomiasis, a form of the disease that affects the female reproductive organs and can lead to infertility, but also stigma and discrimination. This study used a quantitative research approach to explore community women and healthcare workersâ€™ knowledge, attitudes and practices on and health-seeking behaviour of the women regarding FGS in Kongo Central, DRC. While both groups had high knowledge of schistosomiasis, they had a limited understanding of FGS specifically. Misconceptions about its cause and prevention were common, particularly among medical doctors. Many community members engaged in risky water contact and hygiene practices. Healthcare workers reported limited diagnostic tools and expressed interest in specialised training on FGS diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Consequent to limited knowledge and ill-equipped laboratories, health workers are most likely underreporting the disease in the region. The study highlights the need to integrate FGS into public health education programs for both community members and healthcare workers in Kongo Central and underscores the importance of addressing misconceptions about the disease and the prevention measures.
