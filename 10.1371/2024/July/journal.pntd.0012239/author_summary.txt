Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. Several DENV-induced psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression have been identified. Most of the previous studies conducted in the acute stage. Whether deengue infection has lonng-term effects on mental stress remains obscure. Our study suggested that a significant increase in depressive disorder risk across all timeframes post-infection: <3 months, 3–12 months, and >12 months. Sleep disorder risk was higher only during 3–12 months. However, no elevated anxiety disorder risk was found.
