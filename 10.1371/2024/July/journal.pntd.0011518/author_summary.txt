Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a public health disease that affects more than 300 million people in tropical areas in the world and its causative agent is a parasite of the genus Leishmania. In recent decades, the cases in Latin America have increased, corresponding to 6% of cases in the tropical regions of the planet. An insect potential vector associated with the transmission of CL in these tropical and endemic areas is Pintomyia longiflocosa. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the environmental parameters that can influence its life cycle and its vector competence and vector capacity, aspects that are not fully known.
In Colombia, an endemic focus is located in the Huila state, in a rural area of the municipality of Campoalegre, where this study was carried out. The authors found the relationship between some environmental parameters with the life cycle of Pi. longiflocosa under semi-controlled conditions in forested habitats, aspects that were not known until now. The impact of temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation on the gonotrophic cycle, fecundity, fertility, time of development and survival, was evidenced. This research provides information on the environmental conditions that directly affect the possible transmission of the agents that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis.
