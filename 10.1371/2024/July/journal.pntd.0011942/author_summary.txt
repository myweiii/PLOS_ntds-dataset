Preventive chemotherapy with antifilarial drugs is currently the mainstay public health intervention recommended for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (commonly known as elephantiasis) in endemic countries. Two-drug regimen mass drug administration of albendazole plus either diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin has been used widely in most countries since the launch of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis by the World Health Organization in 2000. Safety and efficacy clinical studies conducted in Papua New Guinea have shown that co-administration of three antifilarial drugs namely, ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole is superior to the two-drug regimen diethylcarbamazine and albendazole in clearance of microfilariae from the bloodstream. Consequently, the triple-drug regimen was endorsed for accelerating efforts to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in areas where onchocerciasis is not co-endemic. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of delivering mass treatment with the triple-drug regimen under programmatic conditions. An operational research study was conducted to determine the optimal sampling strategies, indicator (or set of indicators), and study populations for monitoring and evaluation of lymphatic filariasis elimination programs using the triple-drug regimen mass treatment. Two rounds of mass treatment with the triple-drug regimen were given to the residents of Lamu County (comprising of Lamu East and Lamu West sub-counties) and Jomvu sub-County (in Mombasa) in November 2018 and November 2019. The programme epidemiological treatment coverage was at least 80% in each implementation unit during the two treatment rounds. The preventive treatment resulted in significant reductions in the prevalence of the disease with the number of positive cases being fewer than the threshold recommended for areas where transmission is likely to be no longer sustainable.
