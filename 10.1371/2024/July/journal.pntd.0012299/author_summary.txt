In the Great Mekong Subregion (GMS), particularly in Myanmar, vivax malaria remains a significant challenge to malaria elimination. To effectively evaluate the impact of ongoing malaria control measures, it is essential to understand the genetic diversity, relatedness, and population dynamics of the malaria parasite. A comprehensive analysis of P. vivax populations in the western GMS using a global 42-SNP barcode revealed notable changes over time. Compared to the more homogeneous parasite populations a decade ago, there has been a decrease in genetic diversity and an increase in differentiation among parasite populations in recent years, particularly along the China-Myanmar border. In comparison, the 2018 parasites from western Myanmar showed a relatively stable genetic structure, underscoring the persistent challenge of vivax malaria in this region. While the 42-SNP barcode has been valuable in understanding the genetic landscape of global P. vivax populations, it has limitations in accurately differentiating parasite populations across the GMS, necessitating a barcode tailored to the local parasite populations.
