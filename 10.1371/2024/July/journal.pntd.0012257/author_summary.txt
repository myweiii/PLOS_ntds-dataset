We graded face and eye photographs from children in Ethiopia to characterize the relationship between seven measures of an unclean face and several trachoma outcomes. Dry ocular discharge had the strongest associations with trachoma outcomes, and there was a dose-dependent relationship between the seven facial uncleanliness measures and trachoma. Moreover, using a composite measure of facial uncleanliness, such as the presence of nasal discharge, ocular discharge, or flies, had even stronger associations with trachoma. However, it is difficult to determine the importance of these measures of facial uncleanliness as risk factors for trachoma since ocular chlamydia infection can cause ocular discharge and potentially nasal discharge, each of which may in turn attract flies.
