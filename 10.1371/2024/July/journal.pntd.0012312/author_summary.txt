Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is a vector-borne parasitic disease, which can cause stigmatising and disabling skin and eye disease. Throughout Africa, mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and vector control have effectively reduced and prevented the spread of infection. The Onchocerciasis Control Programme (1974–2002) has implemented long-term and large-scale interventions in West-Africa to control onchocerciasis. However, there are still reports of onchocerciasis transmission in many areas. In the Republic of Togo, the northern and central parts were initially most endemic, particularly high infection prevalence around the Ôti, Kéran and Mô river basins. To support policy making towards elimination, we reviewed transmission conditions, the history of control, and trends in various infection indicators over time in Togo from the start of interventions to 2018. We assessed that vector control and ivermectin MDA impacted levels of infection prevalence throughout the country, with over 88% of surveyed villages since 2012 having overall onchocerciasis prevalence below 5%. Some areas would likely need additional or intensified interventions to bring down transmission, in particular communities along the river basins of Amou (Mono), Kara, Kéran, Ôti (Penjari), and Mô.
