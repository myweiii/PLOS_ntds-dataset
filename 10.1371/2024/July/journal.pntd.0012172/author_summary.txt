Usutu virus (USUV) is a virus primarily circulating between birds and mosquitoes. Other blood-feeding arthropods, such as ticks, feed on birds. However, it is unknown whether ticks can be infected with USUV and transmit the virus to birds or other animals. Therefore, we infected a tick cell line and ticks collected from the field with USUV. We showed that the virus replicates in tick cells, as well as in field-collected ticks. Moreover, we showed that USUV disseminated through the tick body and was excreted with the saliva of ticks during artificial feeding. We further investigated if ticks are infected with USUV while feeding on wild birds and when searching for a host in the vegetation. We found that 7.7% of tick-infested birds carried USUV positive ticks, while USUV was not detected in questing ticks. Our findings provide evidence that ticks can be infected with USUV and might transmit the virus to another host, but the role of ticks in the transmission of USUV is expected to be minor.
