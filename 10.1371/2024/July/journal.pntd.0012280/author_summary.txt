Trachoma is a blinding eye disease caused by infection of the eye by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct). Trachoma is responsible for vision impairment or blindness in 1.8 million people and is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. The presence of flies around the eyes of young children is a common feature of life in trachoma endemic communities worldwide. This fly is most often Musca sorbens, an understudied species thought to transmit Ct.
In order to understand more about Musca sorbens flies and their relationship with Ct, the researchers studied 247 households in the Oromia region of Ethiopia, where there is known to be a lot of trachoma. The authors found evidence of Ct on flies and that flies in households containing children with Ct infection were much more likely themselves to be carrying Ct, adding to evidence that M. sorbens flies contribute to transmission of the bacterium. They also found that children who weigh less and currently have trachoma were more likely to have flies land on their face. Should further studies clearly elucidate a role for M. sorbens as vectors of trachoma, controlling fly populations or preventing fly-eye contact may become an important aspect of trachoma disease control.
