Acute melioidosis, caused by B. pseudomallei infection, is considered one of the lethal infectious diseases reported in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Infection with this bacterium can lead to a severe systemic inflammatory response or sepsis, which is a major cause of death. The mortality rate of acute melioidosis may reach up to 50%. In contrast, very rare cases were reported from patients infected with B. thailandensis, a non-virulence strain. Although it is well-documented that these two bacteria share genetic similarities and can exhibit similarities in survival and replication inside most murine and human cells, there is very limited information on how only B. pseudomallei can cause sepsis in melioidosis patients, while B. thailandensis dose not. We established an infection model using primary human monocytes to demonstrate that only B. pseudomallei can induce pyroptosis, causing the release of key cytokines that are involved in sepsis. This information may contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis in acute melioidosis and may guide future treatments.
