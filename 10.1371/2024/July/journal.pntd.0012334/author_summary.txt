Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted virus that is a leading cause of hospitalisation and death in Asian and Latin American countries. Protection against dengue infection mainly relies on mosquito control, but the current development of drugs against the virus opens new perspectives for prevention. To develop efficient prevention strategies, it is important to understand how prevalent and transmissible the virus is in a given population. In this study, we conducted a large serological survey in Nha Trang City, Vietnam, and developed a mathematical model to simulate the effect of preventive antiviral treatment on dengue outbreaks in that population. We compared the strength of these effects to that of other prevention startegies, such as mosquito control. We found that a large proportion of the population had been previously infected by dengue virus. In this context, our simulations showed that drugs are more effective in preventing dengue cases than mosquito control, and that these strategies are most effective when the radius of intervention increases and the delay of intervention decreases. These findings show that preventive administration of antivirals during outbreaks can substantially reduce the spread of dengue virus in part of the world where it is highly prevalent.
