Sporotrichosis is the leading subcutaneous mycosis worldwide. In the last decades, Brazil has faced an epidemic of zoonotic cases. The Brazilian Amazon region had no human cases reported in 2020, nevertheless, a striking rise in both human and animal cases was observed from 2020 to 2023, totalizing 950 human and 2,823 animal sporotrichosis. The majority of cases were reported in Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon, but cases were also documented in other populous municipalities. The study emphasizes the correlation between animal and human cases, as well as the spatial and temporal progression of the disease, moving from downtown areas to the periphery. Cats were identified as the primary reservoirs, with contact with infected animals being a significant risk factor for transmission. Urban areas, particularly domestic environments, were identified as common sites of infection. The predominant species identified was Sporothrix brasiliensis, which exhibits distinct characteristics favoring zoonotic transmission. This study emphasizes the urgent need for collaborative efforts among healthcare professionals, veterinarians, and public health authorities to implement effective control measures and mitigate the impact of the epidemic sporotrichosis in Brazil.
