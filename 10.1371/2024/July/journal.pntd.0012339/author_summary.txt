Malaria tests are commonly the default assessment when febrile patients arrive at clinics in low- and middle-income countries. This is due to the high prevalence of the disease coupled with the increased reliability and affordability of rapid diagnostic tests. While malaria and other prevalent diseases have received great attention in terms of international investments and local efforts over the years, other endemic diseases do not receive the same consideration in terms of testing capacity and, consequently, correct treatment. This study aims to provide a model to inform policymakers on the costs and benefits of carrying out an opportunistic screening for one (or potentially more) of these neglected tropical diseases (NTD), performed at the same time as a malaria diagnosis for febrile patients presenting at clinics. To achieve this, we developed a model to evaluate different healthcare protocols detecting malaria and schistosomiasis simultaneously, with input values referring to Uganda, as a case study. Schistosomiasis is an NTD and the main treatment strategy in endemic populations is mass drug administration (MDA). This study shows the added value of sentinel screening during a malaria diagnosis varying the level of prevalence of both malaria and schistosomiasis.
