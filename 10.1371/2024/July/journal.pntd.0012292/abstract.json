    "Background": "Blastocystis is a unicellular eukaryote commonly found in the intestinal tract of humans and other animals. The prevalence of Blastocystis has been investigated in both developed and developing countries, yet its occurrence and distribution in rural locations has been less studied. Herein, we aimed to examine the distribution of Blastocystis colonization in Thai adults representing background populations along a rural/peri-urban gradient, as well as associations between colonization and personal characteristics.",
    "Methodology": "A total of 238 participants were recruited from rural and peri-urban areas situated in three provinces. The presence of Blastocystis in feces was evaluated using PCR and qPCR. Information on gender, age, region (province), rural/peri-urban location, and body mass index (BMI) was collected.",
    "Principal findings": "The overall rate of Blastocystis carriage was 67.2%. Univariate analysis revealed significant associations between Blastocystis carriage and region (p<0.05), location (p<0.001) and age group (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that rural/peri-urban location and BMI were significantly associated with Blastocystis carriage. Nine subtypes (ST1-ST7, ST10 and ST23) were identified with ST3, ST7 and ST1 as the most abundant ones, in this order. The greatest diversity of subtypes, in terms of numbers, was found in the middle aged group (nine subtypes), while the least diversity was found in the young adult and obese (three subtypes each) groups.",
    "Conclusions": "This study increases the understanding of the epidemiology of Blastocystis colonization and its association with population parameters and characteristics in middle-income countries."
