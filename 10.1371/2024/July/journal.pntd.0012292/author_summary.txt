Blastocystis is an enteric microbial eukaryote of ubiquitous, worldwide occurrence in both humans and animals. Based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene, Blastocystis has been divided into genetically distinct subgroups, called subtypes. It has been hypothesized that some of these subtypes might be pathogenic. Despite a century of research efforts, gaps remain on our knowledge of Blastocystis epidemiology. In this study, the authors investigated occurrence of Blastocystis among Thai, gut-healthy adults from three provinces in a rural/peri-urban gradient and examined associations with age, area of residence and body mass index (BMI). In this study, 67% of the participants were Blastocystis positive. Region, location and age group were individually associated with Blastocystis infection. Statistical model testing indicated that location and BMI were also associated with Blastocystis carriage. Nine subtypes were identified with the middle aged group having the greatest diversity (all nine subtypes). The obese and young adult groups had the least subtype diversity (three subtypes). This study sheds lights on the molecular epidemiology of Blastocystis in middle-income countries.
