Wolbachia pipientis is a naturally occurring, maternally inherited insect endosymbiont that was artificially introduced into the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, the dominant vector of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and Yellow Fever viruses globally. This bacterium is being released into mosquito populations in the field for disease control because Wolbachia reduces the ability of these co-infecting viruses to replicate as well as spread easily through populations due to a form of reproductive manipulation. Previous research has shown that mosquito eggs experiencing long periods of storage make Wolbachia-infected adults more likely to be infertile and exhibit increased biting frequency. Using a combination of behavioral, vector competence, and fitness assays as well as modeling, we show that the increase in biting behavior leads to higher virus prevalence and load in the mosquito. Together, the decreased fertility and the increased virus transmission potential may decrease the efficacy of Wolbachia, particularly in dry climates where mosquitoes likely spend longer in the egg stage before hatching. We highlight a range of future experiments needed to fully ascertain the effect of egg quiescence on virus transmission.
