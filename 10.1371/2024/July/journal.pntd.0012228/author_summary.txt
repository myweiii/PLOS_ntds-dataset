Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract can be caused by a variety of pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Viruses play a particularly important role, especially in low-income countries, where viral gastroenteritis leads to high morbidity and mortality, particularly among children and the elderly. As part of the African Network for Improved Diagnostics, Epidemiology and Management of Common Infectious Agents (ANDEMIA), patients of all ages from four African countries with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis were tested for the most common viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens. Samples from Burkina Faso that tested positive for noroviruses, rotaviruses, sapoviruses or astroviruses were further genotyped and characterized in the present study. In this study we described for the first time the detection of rare rotavirus and astrovirus strains circulating in Burkinabe patients. The knowledge about the circulating virus variants is essential to develop suitable vaccines and adequate pharmaceuticals.
