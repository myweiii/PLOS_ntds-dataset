Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that causes fever, weight loss, anemia and swelling of liver and spleen. About 2500 cases are reported annually in the Americas, with a high mortality rate. Understanding how the immune system of people with visceral leishmaniasis responds to this parasite is essential for the development of preventive and curative methods. In order to understand how gene expression is modulated during visceral leishmaniasis, we infected in vitro cultured human neutrophils, the first immune cells to be recruited in this infection, with Leishmania infantum, the protozoan that causes visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas. Next, we measured the expression of coding RNAs, responsible for the production of proteins required for an effective immune response, and of non-coding RNAs, able to control these coding RNAs, thus helping or hindering host response to infection. Analysis of coding and non-coding RNAs points to an attempt by the parasite to modulate the transcriptome of host cells, influencing the hostâ€™s response to infection. Our work identifies several targets for future functional studies, aiming at the development of preventive or curative treatments for this prevalent zoonosis.
