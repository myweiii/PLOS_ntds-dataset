Most studies with the objective to understand the biology of Zika virus (ZIKV) were carried out using the epidemic Asian genotype of this pathogen. It is currently being discussed whether ZIKV of African genotype may have epidemic potential associated a high risk of fetal pathogenicity. It is thus urgent to improve our knowledge on recently isolated ZIKV strains from West Africa. In this study, we used the sequence of a viral strain from an individual infected by ZIKV in Guinea in 2018 to generate an infectious molecular clone. Analysis of this viral clone highlighted the preponderant role of NS1 to NS4B proteins in virus replication and cell interactions with a particular focus on ZIKV-specific stress granule formation blocking activity. We believe that our data will improve our understanding of the biology of contemporary West Africa ZIKV, opening perspectives towards a better understanding of the pathogenicity of African viral strains.
