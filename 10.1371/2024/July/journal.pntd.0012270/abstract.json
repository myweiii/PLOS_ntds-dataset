    "Background": "Globally, there are an estimated 20.9 million cases of onchocerciasis, with Africa bearing the greatest burden. The World Health Organization (WHO) has targeted the disease for elimination by 2030. As of August 2023, there were 15 foci in 37/48 (76%) districts and one city in Uganda that had reached the elimination phase. However, there is a paucity of data on community involvement in post-elimination surveillance (PES) activities. The communities in the post-elimination phase are expected to maintain surveillance, provide health education, refer cases for treatment, and participate in surveillance. However, it is not clear whether this is being done. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of community involvement in post-elimination surveillance activities in Bududa District, Eastern Uganda, to draw key generalisable lessons for similar settings.",
    "Methods": "This was a cross-sectional study employing rigorous mixed methods of data collection. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect quantitative data on randomly sampled study participants in two sub-countries in the district. Community involvement in post-elimination surveillance (PES) was our dependent variable, measured using Yes or No questions, and our independent variables were measured on different scales. Computations of proportions and associations were done using Stata 15 software. Conversely, qualitative data were collected via focus group discussions (FGDs) for community participants and key informant interviews (KIIs) for local leaders. For the qualitative component, we had 2 FGDs, each consisting of 8 gender-balanced participants per group and 8 KIIs. Qualitative data analyses were done using a robust thematic framework approach, ensuring the reliability and validity of our findings.",
    "Results": "A total of 422 participants with a mean age of 51.4 years (SD = 15.8) participated in the study. Community involvement in post-elimination surveillance was low (14%). Factors associated with involvements were district support [Adjusted odd ratio AOR 14, 95 CI = (2.5, 81.7)], seeing black flies in the environment in a week preceding the survey [AOR 8, 95% CI = (1.5, 42.5)], in one month [AOR 3.8, 95% CI = (1.1, 13.2)], and being a community volunteer in the Ivermectin treatment program [AOR 4.3, 95% CI = (1.03, 17.9)]. Lack of funding, poor motivation, poor program sustainability planning, and a lack of drugs at health facilities were key challenges affecting community involvement in post-elimination surveillance.",
    "Conclusion": "Community involvement in onchocerciasis post-elimination surveillance activities in Bududa District in Eastern Uganda was low but could be improved by increased district support, funding, community motivation and sensitisation."
