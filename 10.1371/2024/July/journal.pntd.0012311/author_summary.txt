This study is the first to comprehensively elucidate the entire transcriptome of Clonorchis sinensis by exploring the expression and regulatory dynamics of noncoding RNAs and mRNAs at different developmental stages in its life cycle. By using next-generation sequencing technology, this research demonstrated new mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs, and established valuable resources for future parasitic research. Compared with mRNAs, lncRNAs have shorter gene lengths, lower expression levels, fewer exons and fewer isoforms. Differential expression analysis demonstrated stage-specific patterns of noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in C. sinensis during its life cycle, thus providing crucial insights into the role of noncoding RNAs in parasite growth and development. Furthermore, the construction of ceRNA regulatory networks revealed that microtubule-related lncRNAs and circRNAs in C. sinensis may play an important role in its growth and development. This study advances our understanding of the entire transcriptome of C. sinensis and introduces novel perspectives for future parasitic infection treatment strategies. In summary, this study establishes a foundation for in-depth investigations into the interplay between noncoding RNAs and parasites, as well as the associated biological processes, thus demonstrating broad research and therapeutic potential.
