Elucidating arbovirus-vector-host contact networks is critical to understand and control mosquito-borne virus transmission, including pathogens such as ZIKV, DENV 1â€“4, CHIKV, and WNV. Here, we report the results of metabarcoding of blood meals of two primary pathogen mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. We found limited human blood feeding by Ae. aegypti and high preference for feeding on mammals by Cx. quinquefasciatus. Interestingly, blood meal analysis revealed dogs as the most utilized host for both vector species suggesting the potential for zooprophylaxis for human-amplified urban arboviruses. Pools of these vector species were tested for seven arboviruses and all were negative. We calculated vectorial capacity to discuss the potential risk and transmission dynamics of pathogens transmitted by these two important vectors in an urban location in Northern Mexico.
