The uptake and metabolism of amino acids, particularly the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine, is greatly important to the survival of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Substantial differences in amino acid metabolism between parasite and human host cells provide a potential route to selective chemotherapeutic agents, which has previously been exploited in the case of the frontline HAT drug eflornithine. We have investigated analogues of the amino acid tryptophan and found that several analogues displayed selective trypanocidal potency, which strongly correlated to a structural modification of halogenation at the 7-position of the indole ring. The trypanocidal activity of these potent compounds could be reversed by supplementing growth media with excess levels of natural tryptophan, suggesting competition and direct involvement of the compounds in tryptophan metabolism. Investigation of parasite metabolism when treated with potent analogues revealed large disturbances of the parasitesâ€™ metabolic function. Importantly, significant disruptions to the metabolism of aromatic amino acids were observed, giving evidence for the direct disruption of this pathway by these compounds. In the future, these analogues could serve as vital tools to gain a deeper understanding of the functional significance of these transamination processes within T. brucei parasites.
