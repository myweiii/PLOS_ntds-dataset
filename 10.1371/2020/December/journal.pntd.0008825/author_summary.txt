Scabies is a skin disease causing discomfort from severe itchiness. It can lead to secondary bacterial infection of the skin (impetigo) that can in turn lead to systemic complications, including septicaemia, kidney disease and rheumatic heart disease. It can also cause sleep disorders and a reduced quality of life. Recently added to the World Health Organization list of neglected tropical diseases, scabies is estimated to affect 150 million people globally each year and is endemic in many Pacific Island countries, including Fiji. We aimed to increase understanding of community beliefs and practices that affect the occurrence of scabies and impetigo, and assess community attitudes towards the use of mass drug administration for scabies and impetigo control in Fiji. The impact of scabies and impetigo on participantsâ€™ quality of life included poor sleep quality, school absenteeism and social isolation, especially among children. Participants had awareness of scabies and impetigo, however, misconceptions around the cause and the ways in which these diseases were transmitted between individuals were common. Participants often reported choosing traditional medical remedies to treat scabies; treatment at health centres was mainly sought for secondary skin infections. Attitudes towards mass drug administration were positive, although some concerns regarding adverse effects were noted. Improved strategies, including a community-centred response, are needed for the success of control efforts in Fiji.
