This study investigated vaccine demand and hesitancy by assessing the intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 and willingness-to-pay. We found that a considerable proportion of the public in China has a definite intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine; a higher proportion expressed a probable intention. Perceived benefits and barriers to vaccination (namely vaccine efficacy and adverse event concerns) of the health belief model constructs were significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intent. A substantial proportion was concerned about fake or faulty COVID-19 vaccines; however, this was not a significant predictor of vaccination intention. The willingness-to-pay for the COVID-19 was determined and was found to be positively associated with income. Higher confidence in domestically-made COVID-19 vaccines was also found in this study. The preference for domestically-made over foreign-made COVID-19 vaccines indicates that a future COVID-19 vaccine developed by domestic companies will receive a favourable response from the public in China.The findings of this study provide useful guidance for tailored interventions to enhance the acceptance of a new COVID-19 vaccine once it is available. Promotional messages framing the benefit of vaccination and concerns about new vaccine safety to enhance vaccine uptake is warranted.
