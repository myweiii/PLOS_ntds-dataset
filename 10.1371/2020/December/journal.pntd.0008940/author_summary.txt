Rabies, a fatal viral disease transmitted via the bite of an infected animal, causes over 59,000 human deaths each year. While domestic dogs are responsible for most human cases, wild animals, particularly carnivores and bats, play an essential role in rabies persistence. Several carnivore and bat species have been identified in the field and laboratory as important rabies reservoirs that can maintain different rabies variants. However, the role of many other carnivore and bat species remains unknown and additional insights are hampered by logistical and funding limitations of field and laboratory research. Using machine learning, we used information on known rabies reservoirs to forecast previously unidentified rabies reservoirs. Our models predicted 44 carnivore and 34 bat species that could already be serving as unrecognized rabies reservoirs or that have trait profiles suggesting their capacity to become reservoirs via future host shifting. In many cases, the distribution of these predicted reservoirs overlaps geographically with known reservoir ranges. Our findings can help understand rabies circulation in wildlife and is a first step to guide future epidemiological surveillance in neglected species.
