Head louse infestation is still a common health problem worldwide. Permethrin is the first line treatment of choice for pediculosis. However, the increase of recurrent cases and treatment failure of pediculosis raises public health concerns about the growing resistance of permethrin among head lice populations. Early determination of the permethrin resistance status is crucial in order to choose the pediculicide of choice appropriately. Our study demonstrated that the PCR-RFLP is a beneficial technique for knockdown resistance detection of T917I point mutation in head lice because it was inexpensive, accurate, and reproducible. Ultimately, our study emphasized that prompt investigation for permethrin resistance should be taken into account in the context of recurrent or treatment failure cases of pediculosis and the alternative chemical pediculicides based on different mechanism of action should be considered under those particular circumstances.
