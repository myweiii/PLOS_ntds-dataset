Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a parasitic infection transmitted by mosquito bites. Globally, tens of millions are infected, with many disfigured and disabled by severe damage to their lymphatic systems, such as severe swelling of the legs (elephantiasis) or scrotum (hydrocele). The Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF) aims to interrupt disease transmission through mass drug administration (MDA), and to control illness and suffering in affected persons. The World Health Organization recommends conducting Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) in school children aged 6 to 7 years to determine if infection rates have dropped to levels where disease transmission is no longer sustainable. From 2000–2006, American Samoa conducted MDA and made significant progress towards eliminating LF. However, despite passing TAS in 2011/2012 and 2015, surveys in 2016 showed evidence of resurgence. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anti-filarial antibodies in American Samoa in 2016; identify risk factors for testing positive for antigen, microfilaria and antibodies; and compare the efficiency of different sampling strategies for identifying persons who test positive. The sampling strategies that we compared included testing of 6–7 year-old children, population representative surveys of older age groups, and targeted surveys of high-risk groups such as older people, household members of infected children identified through TAS, and known hotspots. Based on our findings, we recommended that in addition to TAS, strategies that target high-risk populations and hotspots would strengthen surveillance and help countries achieve their goals of LF elimination.
