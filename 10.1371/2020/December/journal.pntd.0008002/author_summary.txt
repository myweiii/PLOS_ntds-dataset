Helminth infections are common among school-aged children in Ethiopia. Several cross-sectional studies have investigated the risk factors of these helminths infection. However, most were conducted in an urban setting in Northern Ethiopia. Many of these studies did not report the intensity of helminth infections; and they restricted helminths infection data to binary outcomes. There has been limited report related to zero-inflated model for helminths count data with excess zeros and over-dispersion. Multilevel analysis for nested structure of school data has also been rarely applied. Therefore, we aimed to assess the prevalence and intensity of helminths infection and the related individual-, household-, and school-level risk factors among rural schoolchildren in Southern Ethiopia. Using count model, we modelled the risk factors of helminths egg. Using a multivariate, multilevel, mixed-effect, logistic regression model, we found minimal variation across class- and school-level factors for helminths infection prevalence. We found associations between helminths infection and most individual-, and some household-level factors. Therefore, interventions focusing on the individual, household, and school should be implemented to reduce the prevalence of infection and worm load among schoolchildren.
