Eosinophilic meningitis (EM) is a rare meningitis accompanied by eosinophils in the CSF and caused by multiple etiologies. Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which is a rat lungworm parasite, is the most common cause in tropical Asia. Previous papers have defined EM as CSF eosinophils ≥10% or CSF eosinophils ≥10/mm3. However, the relationship of EM to parasitic meningitis (PM) remains unclear. This prospective study enrolled 679 patients with suspected CNS infection who were admitted to a tertiary referral hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam from June 2012 to May 2014. The characteristics of patients with ≥10% CSF eosinophilia resembled those of patients with >16% blood eosinophilia without CSF eosinophils, whereas those of patients with ≥10/mm3 CSF eosinophilia were comparable with those of patients with typical bacterial meningitis. Serology or real-time PCR for A. cantonensis was positive in 3 out of 7 patients with ≥10% CSF eosinophilia and 6 out of 7 patients with > 16% blood eosinophilia without CSF eosinophils but none of patients with ≥10/mm3 CSF eosinophilia. The percentage, in contrast to the absolute eosinophil count in CSF, is reliable for predicting parasitic EM. Patients with PM may present with eosinophilia in the peripheral blood but not in the CSF.
