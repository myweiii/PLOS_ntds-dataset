Elephantiasis infection which is common in tropical areas is targeted for elimination globally through delivery of drugs to all populations living in areas where infections occur. Community Drug Distributors (CDDs) are persons who live in the affected communities and who volunteer themselves to distribute drugs after receiving training from the health care workers. Understanding the challenges and opportunities for improved community drug uptake from the perspectives and experiences of the CDDs is important for a successful elimination campaign.
As part of a larger study to address barriers of drug uptake in Kenya, we collected qualitative data to explore the challenges and opportunities for improved drug uptake in two wards of Kilifi County. The data was collected through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews and analyzed.
For drug uptake to be improved, the CDDsâ€™ mentioned challenges related to how their selection is done, number of CDDs engaged, quality of their training, quantities of drugs issued to them, supervision and motivation that need to be addressed. The communities targeted for treatment need well scheduled health education activities on elephantiasis, awareness creation on drug distribution and drug reaction for them to understand the importance of receiving the treatment. These findings suggest the need for strong collaborations between NTD program, county health personnel and the community that are useful in the planning the implementation of successful national programs.
