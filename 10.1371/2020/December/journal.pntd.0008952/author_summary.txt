Clonorchiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. C. sinensis is a biological carcinogen causing cholangiocarcinoma in humans. Juvenile worms inhabit and grow to adults in the bile ducts. Bile acids in the bile are double-edged molecules; they promote metabolism, but differences in their concentration across the cell membrane could lead to bile intoxication. The sodium-bile acid co-transporter of C. sinensis (CsSBAT) is indispensable for maintaining its normal physiology and bile detoxification in the bile duct. However, information related to the molecular and biological characteristics of the SBAT of liver flukes is not available. Here, we cloned CsSBAT for the first time in trematodes and characterized its tertiary structure and physiological functions. The sequential and structural properties of CsSBAT were similar to the apical sodium-bile acid co-transporter found in mammalian intestines. CsSBAT shared a mesenchymal tissue distribution with Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide in the hepatocytes adjacent to the bile ducts. Bile acids accumulated in C. sinensis adults when CsSBAT was inhibited, causing their death. This information might promote further studies on the physiological functions of SBAT and other trematode bile transporters and open new avenues toward developing novel anthelminthic drugs.
