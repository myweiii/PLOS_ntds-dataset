Among the major NTDs, STH are one of the most common disabling chronic infections. Currently available drug treatments, whilst considered safe and generally well tolerated, do not confer protection against new infections. In Indonesia, prevalences of STH of up to 90% have been reported but these estimates are based on data from the 1980s and 90s. More up-to-date STH prevalence estimates are urgently needed to help guide future control efforts.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in rural villages in Semarang, Central Java to determine human STH prevalence and associated risk factors. One-third of all cohort participants were positive for STH with prevalences of 26%, 7.9% and 1.8% identified for Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Trichuris trichiura at 7.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Risk of A. lumbricoides infection was higher for females, whilst farmers and adults over 50 had an increased risk of hookworm infection. Poverty, overcrowding in the home and goat ownership were also associated with an increased risk at the household level.
Soil-transmitted helminthiases remains a significant health problem in Central Java, Indonesia, exacerbated by limited knowledge about STH, poor sanitation and hygiene and poverty prevalent in the region. Control efforts would benefit from an integrated approach emphasising WASH, health education and chemotherapy. Further studies investigating environmental contamination with STH in and around homes in endemic areas could provide further insight into links between household factors and STH identified in our study.
