Dengue is considered the most important mosquito-borne viral disease and a global public health threat. In recent decades, large scale epidemics of dengue have occurred across sub-Saharan Africa including mainland Tanzania. Aedes aegypti is identified as the principal vector for dengue transmission in most affected countries. In the absence of antiviral treatment and as a dengue vaccine is not readily available; dengue prevention depends largely on vector control. As mosquitoes develop resistance towards commonly applied chemical insecticides, environmental management targeting the destruction of larval habitats is recommended. In Zanzibar, little is known about Ae. aegypti in terms of type, magnitude, or distribution of its larval habitats. In this study, we identified the main larval habitats of Ae. aegypti, their seasonal variations and factors contributing to Ae. aegypti abundance across urban and rural settings of Unguja Island in Zanzibar. We found widespread presence and abundance of the vector with plastic and metal containers as well as car tires identified as the most important larval habitats. Season, location of water container, water storage, sun exposure, presence of vegetation and organic matter were among the factors associated with high Ae. aegypti abundance. This study is the first to document widespread occurrence and distribution of Ae. aegypti in Zanzibar and highlights the need for the establishment of a nation-wide Aedes surveillance program to guide the development and monitoring of targeted, context specific vector control interventions for prevention of dengue and other arboviral epidemics. Aedes surveillance involves periodic inspection of households and surrounding environments for presence of larvae/pupae in water-holding containers which are then targeted for larval source reduction, as well as monitoring of adult mosquito populations.
