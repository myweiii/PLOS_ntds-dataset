Chagas disease is a neglected illness caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which affects 6 to 7 million people worldwide. The current treatment for acutely-infected patients is mostly limited to the benznidazole (Bz) drug, reaching up to 80% of cure. It has been proposed that Bz therapy efficacy involves both trypanocidal and immunonodulatory effects. In this sense, we previously suggested that CD8+ T cells, highly expanded after Bz treatment of acute T. cruzi-infected mice, might play a particular role in parasite control. Here, by further investigating those expanded CD8+ T cells, we observed that they bear a clear-cut effector phenotype and that a significant part of them stand out as a subpopulation bearing low levels of CD8 on their surface. Interestingly, besides the evident parasite control, Bz-treated mice sustain a group of effector CD8low cells with spontaneous IFN-γ production. Moreover, in vitro-stimulated CD8+ T cells, sorted from infected and Bz-treated mice, present a relevant group of IFN-γ+ cells with a CD8low phenotype. Altogether, our data indicate the particular subset of CD8low cells as potentially contributing for a sustained protective immunity in T. cruzi-infected animals under Bz therapy.
