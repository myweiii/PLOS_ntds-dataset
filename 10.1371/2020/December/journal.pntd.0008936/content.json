    "Introduction": "Snake envenoming is a significant and neglected global public health issue causing multiple potentially life-threatening toxin-mediated clinical syndromes. Global estimates from the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimate 2.7 million snakebites and 81,000 to 138,000 deaths per annum globally attributable to snakebite [1]. Early access to medical care is imperative, and antivenom is the standard of care for envenomed patients. Snakebite is classified as a category A neglected tropical disease by the WHO [1]. Neglected tropical diseases are predominantly communicable diseases prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. They affect over one billion people in resource-limited settings, carrying significant economic cost for low-middle income countries. In the context of snake envenoming, this may mean limited access to antivenom, blood products, specialised hospital and intensive care, and ventilators. The WHO recently set a global target for a 50% reduction in snakebite associated mortality and morbidity by 2030 [1].\nHemotoxic clinical toxin syndromes carry a significant risk of haemorrhage and death. Snake venoms have toxins which can act as anti-coagulant toxins which inhibit the clotting cascade, or as pro-coagulant toxins which activate the clotting cascade and consume clotting factors [2]. The consumption coagulopathy is commonly referred to as a venom induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC). VICC is marked by prolonged clotting times, and clotting factor deficiencies (i.e. hypofibrinogenaemia, low factor V, low factor VIII) and an elevated D-dimer [2\u20135]. VICC has a rapid onset and resolves with neutralisation or inactivation of the toxins and synthesis of new clotting factors [3,6,7].\nA subset of snake envenomings with VICC develop thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA); a different, poorly understood haemotoxic syndrome [6,8\u201317]. The pathological hallmarks of TMA include small vessel micro-thrombosis and endothelial damage [18\u201320]. A mechanical red cell fragmentation known as microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) ensues, seen as circulating red cell fragments (schistocytes) in the blood [18,21]. Diagnosis of TMA is established by either thrombocytopenia with MAHA; or less commonly tissue biopsy [18,20]. The main risk in TMA is vaso-occlusive organ damage [18]. In TMA following snakebite the major end organ injury appears to be renal [6,11]. Dialysis is the mainstay of therapy for acute kidney injury (AKI) in snakebite. Further understanding of TMA following snakebite has been limited by available evidence, predominantly small and observational studies, many using varied and ill-defined nomenclature regarding TMA and VICC [11].\nTMA following snakebite has been compared to other TMA conditions, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) [11,22]. TTP results from acquired or inherited deficiency in a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS-13). TTP has a high fatality rate, with patient outcomes including survival dramatically improved by TPE with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) volume replacement [18,19,21]. Some studies have proposed therapeutic plasmapheresis (TPE) as an effective treatment for the acute kidney injury (AKI) of TMA following snakebite [23\u201325]. Associations between TMA following snakebite and HUS have arisen primarily given the apparent renal predominant end organ injury of both disorders [25\u201327]. Whilst TPE is commonly used during the initial presentation of HUS, it is usually unsuccessful. HUS is usually toxin mediated secondary to enterohaemorrhagic E. Coli diarrhoea, or complement mediated and associated with underlying genetic mutations of complement genes [18,20]. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody which targets complement C5, is now considered first line therapy for complement mediated HUS [18\u201320]. Any association between TMA following snakebite and either TTP or HUS with respect to pathophysiology, long term outcomes or best treatment, has not been established.\nWe performed a systematic review of TMA following snakebite, using a prespecified case definition. A descriptive synthesis of baseline characteristics; clinical presentation; outcomes of AKI, dialysis free survival (DFS), other end organ damage and overall survival; and evidence for or against intervention with TPE is presented.",
    "Methods": "Search strategy and selection criteria\nThe protocol for this systematic review has been previously published [28] and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019121436). We performed the systematic review according to the Preferred Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist (S1 Table) [29,30].\nDatabase searches included Pubmed, Medline via EBSCO, the Cochrane library, and grey literature searches of Grey Matters checklist, Google Scholar, opengrey.eu, grelit.org, GreyNet, Grey Literature Report, and BIOSIS Previews. Our last search date was the 16th March 2020. Searches were limited to human studies. Search terms included snakes, snakebites, venoms, thrombotic microangiopathies, thrombosis, erythrocytes, schistocytes, red cell fragments, haemolysis, kidney disease and multiple organ failure. MeSH terms were used when possible, or alternatively free text words via Boolean search (S2 Table).\nInclusion criteria for TMA following snakebite cases were human studies on suspected or confirmed snakebite together with definite features of TMA. Definite features of TMA were defined a priori, as either explicitly reported blood film red cell fragmentation (schistocytes); or histological findings of TMA evidenced by vascular small vessel micro-thrombosis or wall injury (S1 Text) [18\u201320].\nAll studies reporting original data were eligible for inclusion, including published and unpublished studies, reports, conference abstracts, dissertations and conference papers. There were no exclusions with respect to patient age, age of study or minimum follow up period. Exclusion criteria included review studies not reporting original data, animal or in-vitro studies.\nThe first author independently screened retrieved abstracts for relevance. Two independent reviewers then screened relevant full text articles for eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. The bibliographies of full reviewed journal articles were manually searched for potentially relevant publications.\n\n\nData analysis\nData extraction was conducted by two independent reviewers. We contacted 32 corresponding authors for further information when email was available. Seven responded and provided numerical data not published in the original paper. Where publications with the same author contained partly or completely duplicated cases, data were merged.\nFor study design classification, case series and cohort studies were differentiated as described by Mathes et al [31], with cohort studies clearly using exposure based sampling, longitudinal follow up over time for the occurrence of outcomes, reporting data which enabled effect measures for a risk of an outcome, with the temporality between exposure and outcome well defined.\nWhere possible data were converted to SI units and unified. Bleeding was classified as minor or major as per the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis guideline for non-surgical patients [32]. AKI was classified according to dialysis requirement, and renal recovery outcomes by DFS and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage where reported data allowed. End stage kidney disease (ESKD) was defined as dialysis dependant stage 5 CKD. VICC was categorised where possible by partial or complete VICC as previously described [28]. If no coagulation studies were performed within the first 48 hours post bite, VICC was recorded as unable to be determined (S3 Table).\nTwo reviewers independently assessed risk of bias for included studies using the framework of Murad et al (S4 Table) [33]. The accumulated level of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework [34]. Agreement between the two independent reviewers for study eligibility and data extraction was assessed by Cohen\u2019s Kappa coefficient.\nA descriptive synthesis of findings was performed. It was not appropriate to quantitatively pool synthesised outcome results in a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in cases, statistical reporting, study design and settings, definition of clinical outcomes and potential confounding between low-middle, and high-income countries. Findings were synthesised by stratification according to risk of selection bias for included studies. Studies with a low risk of selection bias were grouped and findings presented in a detailed descriptive synthesis. Studies with an unclear or high risk of selection bias were presented in a summary table of baseline characteristics, interventions and outcomes. Within studies, continuous data were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR) except where otherwise specified. Nominal data were aggregated as frequencies or proportions for each study. Odds ratios were calculated for studies with a low risk of selection bias, for intervention with antivenom and the binary outcomes of AKI, dialysis dependant AKI, ESKD, DFS and overall survival; and for intervention with TPE, DFS.\nStudy screening and review was managed by Covidence systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia www.covidence.org. Data were analysed by GraphPad Prism 8.2.0 for Windows, Graphpad Prism Software, La Jolla California USA www.graphpad.com.",
    "Results": "Seven-thousand-and-forty-two articles underwent abstract screening, with 223 full text reviews, and 72 studies selected (Fig 1). These included 31 single case reports [13,15,16,22\u201324,35\u201359], 31 case series [8,9,14,17,25\u201327,60\u201383], nine cohort studies [11,84\u201391], and one nested case control study (Table 1) [92]. Eighteen studies contained completely or partially duplicated cases which were merged (S5 Table) [9,11,14,23,26,41,60,66\u201368,75,76,81,84\u201386,88,92]. After merging, 351 unique cases fitting the inclusion criteria for TMA were included in our systematic review. Most cases resulted from snakebites in India (n = 164, 46.7%), Sri Lanka (n = 102, 29.1%) and Australia (n = 42, 12.0%). The envenoming snake was identified in 215 cases, of which 174 (80.1%) were vipers, 40 (18.6%) elapids and one (0.5%) colubrid. The commonest species were hump-nosed vipers (Hypnale spp.), Russell\u2019s viper (Daboia russelii), Australian brown snakes (Pseudechis spp.), American pit-vipers Bothrops spp. and Echis spp. (Carpet and saw-scaled viper) (Table 1).\nRisk of bias was high or unclear in 72% of studies for selection methods; high or unclear in 71% of studies for causality; and high or unclear in 56% of studies for reporting (Fig 2 and S6 Table). Risk mostly pertained to whether selection methods allowed a true representation of the whole experience of the investigators; alternative causes for outcomes were appropriately ruled out; and cases were reported with sufficient detail for other practitioners to make inferences about their own practice. Risk of bias for ascertainment of outcomes was low in 92% of studies for exposure to snakebite envenoming; 92% of studies for AKI; 71% of studies for DFS; and 86% of studies for overall survival. Risk of bias for ascertainment of other end organ damage was unclear or high in 54% of studies, usually due to unclear or no reporting (Fig 2).\nReviewer judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies using the Murad et al risk of bias tool [33]. AKI: acute kidney injury; DFS: dialysis free survival.\nTwenty studies clearly represented the whole experience of study investigators, with defined recruitment and inclusion criteria (Tables 2 and S6). Studies of the Australian Snakebite Project reported TMA in 3.6% (31/856) of all Australian snakebites [81], 15% (6/40) of Australian taipan (Oxyuranus spp.) bites, and 10% (15/149) and 13% (4/32) of brown snake (Pseudonaja spp.) envenomings [11,85,86]. A Sri Lankan study found TMA in at least 5.4% (25/465) of suspected and proved Hypnale bites, using a TMA case definition of MAHA, thrombocytopenia and AKI [84]. Multiple studies reported histological findings of more highly selected cases of snakebite and AKI proceeding to renal biopsy and autopsy. Histological TMA changes in renal specimens were common (S7 Table) [61,62,69,74\u201376,79,87]. Most TMA cases occurred in adults, and males were moderately over-represented compared to females (Table 2).\nThirteen studies with low risk of selection bias reported rates of coagulopathy (Table 2). Nine studies found coagulopathy in 100% of TMA cases [9,11,26,75,79,85\u201387,90]. The remaining studies reported coagulopathy in only a proportion of cases. However time to hospital presentation in these was typically prolonged, meaning VICC may have been missed [84,88,89,91]. Coagulation findings were heterogeneously reported. Some studies reported data allowing classification as VICC; others reported non- laboratory based tests including whole blood clotting times (WBCT). Bleeding was common, typically minor and mucocutaneous (Table 2). Major haemorrhage occurred in 2/15 (13%) of Australian brown snakebites with TMA, of which one was a fatal intracranial haemorrhage [85]; and 2/12 (17%) of Russell\u2019s viper snakebites with TMA, both gastrointestinal, one of which was fatal [26,67]. Moderate thrombocytopenia and anaemia with elevated haemolysis markers were almost universally present (Table 2 and S1, S2 and S3 Figs). VICC typically occurred soon after the onset of envenoming, and changes of MAHA including haemoglobin and platelet nadir, and maximum LDH in subsequent days (S4, S5, S6 and S7 Figs).\nAKI was present in 94% (n = 293) of a total 312 included cases, after removal of case reports, where AKI was reported (Tables 2 and S5). Among individual studies with a low risk of selection bias, a single centre retrospective cohort study from India found AKI in 36/47 (77%) of snakebite with TMA [88]. Australian Snakebite Project studies found AKI in 26/30 (87%) of snakebite with TMA cases [81]. Remaining studies with low risk of selection bias were not representative of AKI prevalence in snakebite associated TMA, owing to: not reporting AKI frequency; using AKI as an inclusion criterion for TMA cases; or recruiting highly selected cases from renal units or renal biopsy pathology services.\nMany TMA cases with AKI required dialysis support (Fig 3A). The largest study with a low risk of selection bias found dialysis dependence in all 47 Sri Lankan cases of TMA with AKI following viper bites [91]. However, this study was based in a specialist tertiary renal centre. Three Indian studies reported dialysis dependence in 25/36 (69%), 19/22 (86%) D. russelii, and 18/19 (95%) of snakebite associated TMA cases with AKI [26,88,89]. An Australian Snakebite Project study found dialysis dependence in 13/24 (54%) of snakebite associated TMA cases with AKI [11,81]. Other studies reported much smaller numbers of TMA cases with AKI, from highly selected intensive care units or renal pathology departments, most of which were dialysis dependant [9,62].\nStudy data for (A) dialysis dependant AKI (D-AKI) versus non-dialysis dependant AKI (non-D AKI); (B) dialysis free survival (DFS) for cases with dialysis dependant AKI; and (C) overall survival for all TMA cases for studies with low risk of selection bias. ESKD: End stage kidney disease.\nMost TMA cases with dialysis dependant AKI achieved DFS (Fig 3B). The three largest studies were from Indian and Sri Lankan tertiary hospital specialised renal centres. DFS for dialysis dependant AKI cases was 26/28 (93%) [91]; 18/19 (95%) D. russelii [26]; and 12/15 (80%) [89]; with cases lost to follow up 19/47 (40%) [91]; 0/19 [26]; and 3/18 (17%) [89] respectively. The Australian Snakebite Project found DFS in all 13 dialysis dependant AKI cases [11,81]. Two small studies of Bothrops envenomings in Brazil reported highly selected cases proceeding to renal biopsy [62,87]. Outcomes were poorer with DFS 3/5 (60%) and 0/2, respectively. Two recently published large cohort studies with low risk of selection bias did not explicitly report DFS outcomes for their patient cohorts [84,88]. Timing of dialysis dependence was reported in four studies with low risk of selection bias. In cases achieving DFS, dialysis dependence persisted for: 12 (7\u201324) days (median, IQR, n = 45) [91]; 18.0 +/- 8.1 sessions (mean, SD, n = 15) [89]; 13.0 (10.0\u201324.0) days (median, IQR, n = 9) [11,81]; and 2.0 (2.0\u20134.7) sessions (median, IQR, n = 8) [26,68].\nSeven studies with a low risk of selection bias reported renal outcomes versus intervention with antivenom (Table 3). The largest study reporting data on antivenom intervention was by Mohan et al, reporting 36 snakebite associated TMA cases of which 28 received antivenom and 8 did not. AKI was present in all 36 cases. DFS was not specifically reported for cases, however survival was 100% in patients treated with and without antivenom [88]. A study by Namal et al reported 29 cases of snakebite associated TMA in Hypnale envenomings, for which no specific antivenom is available. All 29 cases had AKI, but specific outcomes of dialysis dependence and DFS were not reported [84]. The Australian Snakebite Project studies included 29 cases treated with antivenom, and one not treated with antivenom. In the antivenom group, AKI occurred in all cases, dialysis dependant AKI in 25/29 (86%), and DFS in the dialysis dependant AKI group was in 12/12 (100%). The one case not treated with antivenom developed a dialysis dependant AKI and achieved DFS. For all studies reporting antvenom intervention and renal outcomes, calculated odds ratios for the outcomes of AKI, dialysis dependant AKI, DFS and overall survival were non-significant (Table 3).\nThree studies with a low risk of selection bias reported outcomes for DFS in cases with dialysis dependant AKI, versus intervention with TPE (Fig 4A). The largest was a Sri Lankan single centre prospective cohort study, reporting outcomes for intervention with TPE, FFP alone, and no TPE or FFP [91]. Dialysis dependence at time of discharge from hospital was higher in the TPE group (6/9, 67%), versus 7/17 (41%) for FFP alone; and 4/17 (24%) for no TPE or FFP. DFS at three months was 12/13 (92%) for no TPE or FFP; 9/10 (90%) for FFP alone; and 5/5 (100%) in the TPE treatment group. Patients who did not receive TPE had better renal function and less chronic kidney disease at three months compared to those given TPE. The authors found TPE was not associated with improved blood transfusion requirements, platelet count recovery, requirement for dialysis or hospital duration of stay. A second study from India found no significant difference in DFS for dialysis dependant AKI snakebite for patients who got TPE compared to those who did not [89]. The Australian Snakebite Project reported DFS in all patients, both TPE (n = 5) and non-TPE (n = 8) cases with dialysis dependant AKI [11,81]. We calculated odds ratios for DFS and TPE intervention for these studies and found a non-significant difference (p>0.05) in DFS between treatment groups (Fig 4B and S8 Table).\nDialysis free survival for plasmapheresis (TPE) versus non-TPE treated cases for studies with low risk of selection bias: (A) total number of cases; and (B) odds ratio of dialysis free survival (DFS) for TPE vs non-TPE. p>0.05 for all calculated odds ratios. ESKD: End stage kidney disease.\nTwo additional studies with low risk of selection bias reported patient groups with and without TPE intervention, without explicitly reporting DFS data [84,88]. Mohan et al reported 36 TMA cases with AKI from India, of which 25 required dialysis support. One received TPE, and 24/25 no TPE. Summary data for the whole 36 AKI cases was reported with 26/36 discharged without complication and 3/36 lost to follow up. DFS was not explicitly reported. The case treated with TPE achieved DFS, but had a persistently abnormal creatinine at six weeks [23,88]. Namal et al reported 44 Hypnale bite cases with AKI, of which 25 met our inclusion criteria for TMA. TPE was used in 7/44 cases; however, outcomes specific to the TMA group for dialysis dependence, DFS and overall survival for TPE versus no TPE intervention were not reported. Of all 44 cases with AKI, 30/44 (68%) required dialysis support, four were lost to follow up, 29/40 (72%) recovered, 9/40 (22%) developed CKD (of which at least one was treated with TPE), and three died [84].\nOverall survival for all TMA cases was reported in 11 studies with low risk of selection bias (Fig 3C). The majority of cases survived, but survival outcomes between studies were heterogenous. Of these 11 studies, the largest four cohort studies reported survival of 100% (n = 47) in a retrospective cohort study from India [88], 97% (29/30) in the prospective Australian Snakebite Project studies, and 93% (26/28) and 94% (15/16) in two cohort studies of viper bites from Sri Lanka and India respectively [89,91]. One case series of more highly selected patients proceeding to renal biopsy or autopsy from India had poorer survival of 44% (11/25) [75]. Cause of death for all studies in which it was reported was most commonly shock, refractory hypotension, major haemorrhage, or organ failure.\nPatient data for other organ damage except renal injury, was reported in six studies with a low risk of selection bias (Table 2). Other end organ damage was uncommon. Occasional cases of clinical multiorgan, cardiac, neurological, pituitary, lung, and bowel dysfunction were reported. However, attribution to TMA specifically as the cause was uncertain [81,84,87\u201389]. TMA findings were rarely reported in other organs at autopsy (Tables 2 and S7) [79,87].\nFifty-two studies eligible for inclusion in this systematic review had an unclear or high risk of selection bias, most case reports or small case series (Table 4). Most reported AKI which was dialysis dependant. Renal outcomes were heterogeneously or unclearly reported in many of these studies. The majority achieved DFS with or without TPE, however the studies were heterogenous in selection and outcomes, and did not clearly represent the entire experience of the study authors.\nFour cases had ADAMTS-13 testing, and two cases complement C3 and C4 testing, all of which were normal [14,17,38,41,73,77]. One nested case control study found significantly increased red cell microvesicles in TMA compared to non-TMA snakebite cases; no significant difference in platelet microvesicles between TMA and non-TMA snakebite cases; and reduced endothelial microvesicles in all snakebite cases compared to normal controls [92].\nGRADE assessment of strength of accumulated evidence was moderate for the outcome of AKI; and low to very low for DFS, other end organ damage and survival; attributable to the small observational study design, inconsistency and imprecision of results reporting of included studies (Tables 5 and S9).",
    "Discussion": "We report the first systematic review to synthesise the reported prevalence, features and outcomes of TMA following snakebite. Snakebite associated TMA was reported in a broad range of different envenoming snake species and countries worldwide. Cases were predominantly from vipers in India, Sri Lanka followed by elapids from Australia, with smaller numbers from other countries. Previous studies have considered TMA in snakebite uncommon [17,22,38]. In the context of global estimates of 2.7 million snakebites and 81,000 to 138,000 deaths per annum globally attributable to snakebite, our 371 retrieved cases suggest snakebite associated TMA is a rare disease. However, we found TMA reported in 10\u201315% of Australian elapid envenomings, and 5.4% of proven and probable Hypnale bites in Sri Lanka, in studies with a low risk of selection bias. Consistent with these findings, a recent prospective cohort study from Sri Lanka published after our last database search date reported a prevalence of 11% TMA in a total of 103 proven Hypnale envenomings, applying our definition of TMA in this systematic review [94].\nTMA following snakebite usually presented in association with coagulopathy, with a delayed thrombocytopenia and MAHA in the days post envenoming. Coagulation changes were typically of a VICC as evidenced by hypofibrinogenaemia and coagulation factor consumption marked by prolonged INR and APTT. Some studies reported less reliable coagulation abnormalities, such as prolonged WBCT. WBCT is a simple bedside test which measures the time to a clot forming within a whole blood sample when exposed to a foreign surface such as glass. Whole blood clotting times have limitations with respect to requirements for standardisation of glassware equipment and samples which can affect sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of coagulopathy after snakebite. However, they remain in use globally as they are a simple bedside test available in resource limited settings [95\u201397]. Anaemia and thrombocytopenia were almost universally present, as seen in other TMAs such as HUS [98].\nThe predominant clinical organ injury was renal, with AKI occurring in over 90% of cases with TMA. The majority required dialysis for AKI over days to weeks, but most patients achieved DFS. Our finding of predominant renal end organ injury confirms similar findings in previous literature reviews [6,99]. Long term outcomes for renal recovery were heterogeneously reported, although most patients recovered partially or completely. Our findings on AKI prevalence and the spectrum of outcomes are potentially confounded by studies based in tertiary referral renal centres.\nWe found no evidence to support a beneficial effect of intervention with antivenom, although high quality studies with a low risk of selection bias, reporting of interventions and clearly ascertained clinical outcomes were few, and small in size. Snakebite associated TMA was found in studies reporting envenomings from Hypnale, for which no effective antivenom is available, but also reported in D. russelii and Australian elapids for which effective antivenom is available and was administered in almost every case. This made any estimate of treatment effect unreliable with very wide confidence intervals due the small numbers (often zero receiving antivenom, or conversely no cases of Hypnale receiving antivenom). In only one study did a reasonable proportion of patients not receive antivenom, but the information on antivenom was unreliable and few outcomes were reported [88]. This means that we found little evidence to support antivenom specifically in treatment of TMA following snakebite.\nIn addition, the clinical studies available provided little evidence as to whether timing of antivenom administration accounted for this lack of evident benefit of antivenom for TMA prevention. The prevention of envenoming seen in animal studies in which antivenom is administered before venom is injected, supports an hypothesis that for some manifestations of envenoming such as TMA, and potentially VICC, administration of antivenom following the bite to prevent that manifestation is so time-critical that in the vast majority of snakebite scenarios, antivenom is administered after the time-critical window [100\u2013102]. Our findings do not detract from the critical role for antivenom in snakebite envenoming more broadly.\nSimilarly, we found no evidence to support a beneficial effect of intervention with TPE for renal outcomes in dialysis-dependant AKI complicating snakebite associated TMA. Cohort studies from Sri Lanka, India and Australia reporting outcomes for TPE intervention showed no statistically significant benefit for DFS. However, the quality of accumulated evidence in our review was low, predominantly owing to the small and observational included studies.\nIn contrast to our findings of predominant renal end organ injury, other end organ damage was uncommon, although our findings are limited by a risk of bias from included studies and uncertainty about TMA specifically with respect to causality. Clinical features of cardiac, cerebral, lung and pituitary involvement occurred in rare cases, but were not clearly attributable to TMA. Histological TMA was rarely found at autopsy in the heart, lung, pituitary gland and bowel, in studies of high or unclear risk of selection bias.\nOf the small number of deaths, the majority were due to major haemorrhage, shock, refractory hypotension, or organ failure. It is likely the early haemorrhagic deaths occurred in relation to initial VICC.\nThe aetiology of TMA following snakebite remains unclear. ADAMTS-13 and complement testing were normal in the rare cases of TMA following snakebite which were tested. The pattern of end organ renal injury in TMA following snakebite is more like HUS than TTP, which tends to cause neurological changes. However, the tendency for renal recovery in TMA following snakebite differentiates it from complement mediated HUS, which tends to occur in adults with historically poor renal outcomes with a likelihood of end stage kidney disease and long term dialysis dependence [18\u201320].\nThe main limitations to this study include the quality of included studies, and limitations on pooling data between heterogenous studies. Included studies showed considerable heterogeneity with respect to study setting, design, selection and reporting. As hypothesised, most studies were small and single centre observational studies, predominantly case reports and case series. Settings varied considerably from cohort studies consisting of all enrolled snakebite envenomings, to more highly selected cohorts from renal referral centres, intensive care units, and renal pathology reporting centres. Consolidation and synthesis of data was limited by selection bias of included studies, and we synthesised our findings by stratifying studies according to this bias. This conferred a lower quality of accumulated evidence, and a resultant relatively weak strength of findings and any recommendations.\nWe propose that patients presenting with snakebite and VICC are at reasonable risk of developing a delayed TMA, with a predilection for renal involvement. In patients presenting with AKI in snakebite it is likely that the majority have underlying TMA. We recommend, where resources allow, all patients presenting with snake envenoming and VICC undergo careful observation for anaemia and thrombocytopenia, serial blood film examination for schistocytes, careful monitoring of renal function and urine output, and judicious use of supportive care including dialysis as required.\nWe found no evidence in support of interventions beyond routine supportive care for the treatment of snakebite associated TMA. However, antivenom is the mainstay of therapy for snake envenoming and should always be given in this setting, although our study found no evidence of benefit specifically for renal outcomes in snakebite associated TMA. Whilst we have found no convincing evidence of a role for TPE, included studies were small and the strength of any recommendations regarding its use are weak. TPE is resource intense, requiring tertiary level hospital care, blood donation and transfusion services, specialised equipment, and staffing. Treatment strategies for snakebite and other neglected tropical diseases must ensure efficient use of limited resources. We recommend that TPE is not routinely used in TMA following snakebite outside of high-quality research studies, and highlight the need for large, good quality prospective studies of snakebite associated TMA."
