Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an important complication of snakebite. It occurs in a subset of patients envenomed by snake species associated with blood clotting abnormalities. TMA is a disorder marked by the formation of blood clots and blood vessel wall damage in the micro-circulation, and it carries a risk of organ damage and failure. Prior to our systematic review, evidence predominantly consisted of case reports and case series studies, and one landmark literature review on TMA following snakebite. Recent studies increasingly reported the use of resource intense treatment with therapeutic plasmapheresis (TPE), with limited supporting evidence of benefit. Our systematic review is the first to collate the worldwide experience of TMA in snakebite. We found TMA reported in at least 5.4% of Hypnale bites in Sri Lanka, and 10â€“15% of Australian elapid envenomings. The main complication was kidney failure. The kidney failure improved in most cases, irrespective of treatment with either antivenom or TPE. The major limitation of our review was the quality of included studies. Whilst antivenom remains the standard of care for snake envenoming irrespective of any evidence for specific benefit in snakebite associated TMA, our systematic review raises questions about whether the use of TPE represents a wise use of resources. There is a high resourcing cost of TPE, potential risks of the treatment, and lack of evidence for benefit. As a neglected tropical disease, it is imperative that treatment strategies for snakebite make efficient use of limited resources. Follow up studies, including good quality prospective cohort or interventional studies, would be best placed to confirm our findings.
