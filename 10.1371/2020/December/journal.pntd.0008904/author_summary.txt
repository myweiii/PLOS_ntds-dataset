Rapid and accurate identification of mosquitoes that transmit human pathogens is an essential part of mosquito-borne disease surveillance. Such identification can be difficult for mosquitoes that transmit malaria, as many are morphologically indistinguishable, including those in the Anopheles gambiae species complex. We photographed 1, 709 individual mosquitoes from 16 laboratory colonies housed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create a database of whole-body mosquito images. We present a methodology for image processing, data augmentation, and training and validation of a convolutional neural network (CNN). We applied this method to our mosquito image database, finding a 96.96% prediction accuracy for class identification and 98.48% for sex. Further, our best model accurately predicted images between 2 strains of a single species and between 2 storage methods of mosquitoes from the same colony. These results demonstrate that image classification with deep learning can be a useful method for malaria mosquito identification, even among species with cryptic morphological variation. We discuss the application of deep learning to mosquito identification in malaria mosquito surveillance.
