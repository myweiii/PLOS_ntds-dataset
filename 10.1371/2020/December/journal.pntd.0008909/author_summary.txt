Schistosomiasis is among the major neglected tropical diseases and affects mainly the developing countries. Although the role of the immune system in driving immunopathology in schistosomiasis has been extensively studied, how adaptive immunity contributes to disease resistance during schistosome infection is still not completely understood. Most livestock species as well as humans are susceptible to schistosomiasis, while some mammals are extremely resistant. The common laboratory C57BL/6 mice are highly susceptible to schistosomiasis; however, the SD rats are extremely resistant. In this study, we first used T cell deficient CD3e−/− C57BL/6 mice and experimental Schistosoma japonicum infection and further established novel T cell deficient models in SD rats to assess anti-parasite roles of T cells. Strikingly, we found that the natural resistance of SD rat to schistosomiasis was abolished in the absence of T cells, despite the fact that the liver pathology was mitigated following infection. Therefore, our study presented experimental support for the rationale to boost T cell function for clearance of schistosome parasites.
