Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Gram-negative saprophytic bacterium, is the causative agent of melioidosis. The burden of human melioidosis globally is predicted at 165,000 cases and 89,000 deaths annually and in Malaysia, it is estimated that more than 2000 patients die per year which is much higher than nation-wide deaths resulting from dengue or tuberculosis. Clinical presentation and antibiotic resistance vary by geographical regions making it difficult for public health officials to outline definitive diagnostic, treatment and outbreak management options for the country. This study provides information on the genetic diversity among Malaysian B. pseudomallei clinical isolates. The epidemiological analysis shows strong correlation of the Malaysian isolates with strains from Southeast Asia especially Thailand, reflecting the regional endemicity.
