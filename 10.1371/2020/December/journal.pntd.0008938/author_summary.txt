To date, the overall aim of the WHO policy of STH control through periodic mass-drug administration (MDA) has been morbidity control through a reduction in infection intensity in school-aged children. The main limitation of this approach is the rapid re-infection rate, both from the environment in areas with poor sanitation, and the persistent reservoir in adults who are not included in the MDA programme. As a consequence of this limitation, there have been calls to change the overall aim from morbidity control to the elimination of STH infection altogether by breaking the transmission cycle through community-wide deworming. However, there is a dearth of epidemiological data pertaining to adults in relation to STH and in addition, most surveys exclude the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis, due to limitations of the diagnostic methods used. Our study aims to provide up-to-date epidemiological data of STH prevalence, individual and household risk-factors for infection and the association with anaemia and malnutrition in children under 5 years. From 396 participants who provided a stool sample, we found a high prevalence of STH infection, predominantly the hookworm Ancylostoma duodenale, across all age-groups and both sexes. There was a clear association between STH infection and open defaecation in this study, with use of a protected pit latrine protective against infection. There were high rates of anaemia and malnutrition which had no statistically significant association with STH infection, and are likely multifactorial. This study uncovered an ongoing reservoir of STH infection despite high coverage with mebendazole MDA, high rates of morbidity alongside the STH infection and a clear association between STH infection and inadequate sanitation. This reflects the need for further interventional research to assess the optimum strategy to alleviate morbidity and break the STH transmission cycle in this population.
