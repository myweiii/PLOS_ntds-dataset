Rift valley fever (RVF) is an emerging zoonotic disease and it is caused by RVFV. This virus is commonly transmitted in endemic areas between wild ruminants and mosquitoes, mainly by mosquitoes of Culex and Aedes genus. Starting from the year 2000, several outbreaks have been reported outside Sub Saharan Africa, in countries facing the Mediterranean Sea (Egypt), or Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Available vaccines for ruminants present limited efficacy or residual pathogenic effects. Consequently, new strategies are urgently required to limit the expansion of this zoonotic virus. The main objective of this work is to investigate transcriptional alterations of Cx. pipiens to RVFV focusing mainly on genes implicated in conventional innate immunity pathways, RNAi mechanisms and the apoptotic process in order to evaluate the involvement of these genes in viral infection. The immune altered genes here described could be potential targets to control RVFV infection in mosquitoes. Some of the genes related to the immune defense response were previously described in others mosquito-arbovirus models, as well as in Drosophila and human. To our knowledge, this study highlights for the first time the Cx. pipiens-RVFV interactions in terms of defense infection-response and provides information for developing in the future new approaches to prevent and control the expansion of the virus.
