Leprosy is a chronic progressive bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium Leprae. It mainly attacks the skin, peripheral nerves in the hands, feet and eyes, causing numbness or weakness of the affected area and resulting in chronic morbidities such as vision impairment, limb disability, trophic ulcers and nerve involvement. Leprosy is assumed to be spread via the respiratory system through nasal droplets. It is commonly found among people living in poor socioeconomic conditions. Therefore to prevent getting complications, early diagnosis and treatment is mandatory. Our aim was to identify any delays in diagnosis and treatment; whether patients are utilizing the existing facilities and to assess patient knowledge of the disease and treatment. Knowledge of the healthcare workers to identify the disease and patient knowledge to continue the treatment is of equal importance to reduce the case load, reduce the diagnostic delay and prevent developing complications. To find the reasons why the services are not utilized and communicate the true picture to the decision makers are the objectives of this study.
