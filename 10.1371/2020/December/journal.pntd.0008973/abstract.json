    "Background": "The leprosy services utilization by the patients at the clinic and field level should be high to achieve the target of eliminating leprosy as a public health problem in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, assessing patient and health system delay of a diagnosis and patient knowledge on disease are of equal importance to reveal the accurate picture.",
    "Methods and findings": "A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the utilization of government healthcare services by 672 adult leprosy patients in Western Province (WP). Paucibacillary patients diagnosed at least six months and above, and Multibacillary patients diagnosed at least 12 months and above were selected by consecutive sampling method. An interviewer-administered questionnaire (IAQ) was used for data collection.",
    "Conclusions": "Utilization of clinic services was satisfactory. However, a considerable patient-related delay was found. Half of the patients were aware of available field services and a majority of contact screening was conducted at hospitals. Patient knowledge on leprosy was satisfactory."
