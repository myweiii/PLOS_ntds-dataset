Fasciolosis is a worldwide neglected parasitic disease which is caused by the infections of liver flukes, such as Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. The excretory-secretory products released by F. gigantica (FgESPs) play important roles in regulating host biological processes. However, the regulation mechanism remains unclear. This study used high-throughput RNA sequencing to describe the comprehensive small RNA profile altered by FgESPs stimulation. We manifested that weeks of FgESPs exposure lead to a possible hypo-reactiveness and the small RNA profile was significantly altered, especially at 4 weeks post exposure. GO and KEGG pathway analyses of DEmiRNAs targets showed that FgESPs participate in regulation of neural activities, digestive function, and immune responses of host, alter several host cellular components or functions such as cell membrane, cellular communication, organelle and checking of DNA damage. The findings of this study reveal the small RNA profile changes following FgESPs stimulation, providing novel data for elucidating the interaction between Fasciola gigantica and infected host.
