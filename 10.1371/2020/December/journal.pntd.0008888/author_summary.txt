Brucella spp. are facultative intracellular pathogens that can persistently colonize host cells and cause the zoonosis- brucellosis. The WHO recommended a treatment for brucellosis that involves a combination of doxycycline, rifampicin, or streptomycin. Rifampicin-resistance related genes were screened by transcriptomic analysis and gene recombination method at low rifampicin concentrations and the major rifampicin- resistance pathways in Brucella spp were predicted. The results showed that the VirB operon, Î²-resistance genes, ABC transporters, quorum-sensing genes, DNA repair- and replication -related genes were associated with rifampicin resistance when no variations of the in rpoB were detected. Among the VirB operons, VirB7-11 may play a central role in rifampicin resistance.
