Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a fatal, zoonotic vector-borne disease caused by Leishmania infantum, a common pathogen for both humans and dogs. Most CanL therapeutics are toxic, expensive, or ineffective. Artemisinin and derivatives have recently demonstrated potent antileishmanial activity in vitro and in experimental models. In this study, dogs with clinical leishmaniasis were randomly included in one of the treatment groups: meglumine antimoniate/allopurinol (control) or artesunate (alternative). Dogs were followed up for 6 months for their clinical score, parasitemia and Leishmania antibody levels. Both groups showed improved clinical scores, parasitemia and antibody titers after treatment. After six months of follow-up, treatment success was very similar in both groups, and 72.73% (16/22) of the controls versus 73.34% (11/15) in the artesunate group had clinical improvement. All dogs initially seropositive by PCR became negative after artesunate treatment, while 14.3% remained positive with the appearance of new cases in the control group. Antibody titers decreased rapidly (from day 30) from baseline especially in the artesunate group, where 58% of the dogs converted to seronegative after 6 months. Artesunate could be a good alternative for treatment of leishmaniasis. Additional clinical trials are needed to obtain more data on this drug.
