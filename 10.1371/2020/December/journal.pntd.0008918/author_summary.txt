Dengue is a rapidly growing public health threat in Sudan. Kassala state is facing a major outbreak of the mosquito-borne dengue virus. This recent outbreak alarmed the local health authorities to establish a successful control program. However, lack of data obstructs their roles to achieve this goal. Here, we provided a detailed picture on the seroprevalence of dengue virus, entomological indices, and natural mosquito infection across Kassala state, Sudan. The study also identified key factors associated with the recent dengue outbreaks in Sudan. All these findings marked the importance to establish successful routine vector and dengue surveillance. These active surveillances should consider sensitive early warning systems providing early anticipation and timely detection and response to the future outbreaks in Sudan.
