Lymphatic filariasis (LF), a disease caused by infection with worms transmitted by mosquitoes, has long been present in Samoa. Since the 1960s, Samoa has attempted to control the disease through many rounds of annual administration of two deworming drugs to the whole population. However, Samoa recently observed that LF transmission was still occurring, prompting mass drug administration (MDA) with three drugs in 2018. Here, we report the baseline survey of an operational research program to evaluate the triple-drug MDA. The survey assessed prevalence and geographical distribution of LF in the population, compared prevalence by age groups, and investigated the burden of elephantiasis (swollen limbs caused by long-term LF infection). The study confirmed ongoing transmission, with 4% of those aged ≥5 years showing antigen in their blood as evidence of infection. Antigen prevalence was more than three times higher in those aged ≥10 years (4.7%) than in 5–9 year-old children (1.3%). Infection was highly clustered within households and villages, with up to 20% of residents infected in known hotspot villages. Future surveillance strategies should consider that i) testing older age groups would provide more accurate indication of LF transmission, and ii) local knowledge can help identify transmission hotspots.
