Dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV) are considered as emerging or re-emerging viruses. Recently, these viruses have produced major epidemics in tropical climate urban centers, and have been associated with neurological manifestations, including Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), which causes muscle weakness, unstable gait, and decreased or absent musculoskeletal reflexes. This study aims to investigate the association between these viral infections and GBS. A case and control study was conducted nationwide, including 97 cases of GBS and 184 controls matched by age, gender, and locality, but not the disease. The study shows a positive association between GBS cases and ZIKV or ZIKV and DENV infection. GBS cases associated with ZIKV depicted a more severe clinical picture (more impairment of functional status, incapacity, and a higher percentage of mechanical ventilation). Finally, the symptoms of suspected ZIKV disease prior to the development of GBS were similar to some previous reports. The impact of the interaction of these three arboviruses, particularly ZIKV, on the health of the Mexican population was less than expected. The Mexican experience could be useful for other populations.
