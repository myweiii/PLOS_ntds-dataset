Live attenuated Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccines constitute a reliable intervention measure to reduce the burden of the disease in endemic countries. In this work we report the generation of attenuated Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) that express vaccine antigens of bluetongue virus (BTV) instead of the virulence factor NSs. The recombinant viruses were able to induce protective immune responses against both RVFV and BTV when administered as vaccines in mice and sheep respectively. Though further optimization is needed to enhance the level of protection in sheep upon a single dose, these results demonstrate the potential of attenuated RVFV as a vaccine vector for other ruminant diseases, in this case enabling bluetongue vaccination while immunizing against RVF. Since RVF outbreaks are sporadic events, preventive vaccination is often not perceived as a real need. In such scenario a bivalent vaccine strategy would make RVF vaccination more appealing.
