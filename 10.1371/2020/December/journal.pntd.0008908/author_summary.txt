The epidemic of the COVID-19 has greatly affected the lives of people all over the world. Before the vaccine has been widely covered, we can only reduce the transmissibility of the virus through the implementation of strong non-pharmaceutical interventions. In response to air passengers who may be carrying the SARS-CoV-2, the Chinese plan is a comprehensive measure of reduction, centralized isolation, and completely testing. We conducted a retrospective assessment of the time and intensity of the implementation of China's policy in order to provide data support for the normal implementation of future measures. The model results indicate that the measures currently taken by China were implemented at an appropriate time to prevent the epidemic spreading and have achieved relatively good effect. This means that these measures need to be strictly implemented for a period of time as the global epidemic situation is still serious. Although our model refers to the seven countries with more severe epidemics in April, the assessment method can be applied to assess the importation risks brought by other countries.
