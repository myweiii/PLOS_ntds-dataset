Leprosy looms still as a public health problem. Unfortunately, the drop in the number of leprosy cases in recent decades has been accompanied by general decline in the expertise of health care professionals to recognize signs and symptoms of leprosy, particularly at the early stages. The situation for individuals confined within a prison is likely worse because it would be rare for this population to receive a clinical exam for leprosy even in the case of obvious signs and symptoms. In this study, we used an active search strategy in the prison population providing them a Leprosy Suspicion Questionnaire (LSQ) with 14 simple questions about symptoms and signs related to leprosy. This questionnaire proved to be a simple, low-cost instrument for screening and identifying new leprosy cases among 1,400 prisoners. After responding to the questionnaire, they were evaluated clinically, and samples of blood and earlobe skin smears were collected for later laboratory anti-PGL-I IgM and RLEP-PCR assessment. Neurological symptoms (“anesthetized skin area” and “pain in nerves) were more commonly associated among the 34 new multibacillary cases diagnosed at penitentiary (rate 2.7%). The confinement time among leprosy patients (LG) was slightly longer than time of leprosy incubation indicating that the infection likely occurred before the imprisonment. Anti-PGL-I results in the LG were higher than in non-leprosy group and RLEP-PCR was positive in 11.8% of the patients, demonstrating that this disease is actually present in the confinement community. The application of the LSQ coupled with follow-up clinical exams and laboratory analysis are all actions with a high potential to reveal new leprosy cases in these confined communities.
