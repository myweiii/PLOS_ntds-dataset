We wish to thank Dr. Anastasia Yirenkyi, Director of the Traditional and Alternative Medicine Directorate, Ministry of Health, Ghana, for facilitating the initial meetings with the Executives of the Ghana Federation of Traditional Medicines Practitioners Association (GHAFTRAM). We also wish to thank the Executives and members of GHAFTRAM for graciously providing the traditional medicines for screening, particularly those who had to submit additional samples for follow-up screening.
