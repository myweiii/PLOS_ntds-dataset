    "Introduction": "Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya are RNA Arboviruses present in some areas of Mexico, mainly in the endemic state of Chiapas that is characterized by presence of the vector that transmit them and an ecology that favors high transmission. According to the national epidemiological surveillance system, Dengue has intensified since 2018 and outbreaks continue in various states while for Zika and Chikungunya a decrease in cases has been reported in recent years. The main objective of this study was to determine the incidence of Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya infections during pregnancy in the state of Chiapas.",
    "Principal findings": "The presence of previous and current infections and coinfections diagnosed by molecular (RT-PCR) and immunological (ELISA for IgG determination) techniques indicates a wide circulation of viruses in asymptomatic people, specifically in pregnant women showing that silent infections in dry season contributes to the preservation of viruses.",
    "Conclusions": "From 136 studied samples, 27.7% tested positive for DENV, 8% for ZIKV and 24.1% for CHIKV by RTPCR and the values of IgG in sera show that 83.9% were positive for IgG antibodies against DENV, 65% against ZIKV and 59.1% against CHIKV. Results demonstrated presence of ZIKV and CHIKV, not detected by the epidemiological surveillance system, so the importance of establishing proactive epidemiological systems more strict, especially because these infections in pregnant women can cause severe health problems for newborn children."
