A study was conducted in a group of pregnant women from a region of southern Mexico where Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya are endemic to determine the presence of three viral infections, clinical manifestations and congenital damage in newborns. Epidemiological surveillance of diseases is mainly based on the incidence of these diseases; however, asymptomatic carriers also play an important role in disease transmission and are generally not included in the systems. In the case of the three arbovirosis studied, asymptomatic infections can occur until 60â€“70% of cases and play an important role in the disease transmission and level of protection of population. The three arboviruses, transmitted by the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, in the same endemic scenario have the possibility of producing a high rate of asymptomatic infections and coinfections, which may go unnoticed. The study provides valuable information to improve knowledge of transmission in a period of low transmission (dry season) and also to understand that silent transmission has medical importance, especially in pregnancy, due the congenital damage that can cause to newborn. Therefore, it is important to design strategies to incorporate information into the national and international epidemiological surveillance system.
