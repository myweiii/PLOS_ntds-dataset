Chikungunya has emerged as one of the most important arbovirus diseases of global health significance. Over the last decade, millions of CHIKV infections have been reported in over 80 countries across several continents. However, there is no approved vaccines or specific therapeutics available, development of antiviral strategies against CHIKV infection has become a pressing issue. In this study, the authors examined using 6-day-old BALB/c mice as an animal model to study CHIKV infection. After shown the 6-day-old mice were permissive and susceptible to CHIKV infection, the authors also evaluated the effectiveness of adenovirus-vectored mouse IFN-Î± (mDEF201) against systemic and lethal challenge of CHIKV infection in 6-day-old BALB/c mice. Single-dose of mDEF201 can protect mice against a lethal challenge of CHIKV. The authors believe that mDEF201 has immense clinical potential as a single dose could protect individuals at high risks during an outbreak. In addition, mDEF201 could also potentially be used to treat CHIKV infections especially during the acute phase.
