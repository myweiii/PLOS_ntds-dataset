Leptospirosis is an infectious zoonotic disease present worldwide and is caused by bacteria belonging to genus Leptospira. Several domestic and wild animals could serve as reservoir hosts of these bacteria and could transmit them to humans, directly or indirectly. Generally, in asymptomatic carriers the infection involves the urinary system, the kidneys in particular, and leptospires are eliminated via urine. In some animals, Leptospira could also colonize the reproductive system as consequence of a systemic infection or venereal transmission. In this work, the Authors describe, for the first time, the detection of Leptospira from male and female reproductive organs of hunted wild boar via culture-dependent and -independent methods. These findings could suggest a possible vertical transmission in wild boar, but also a possible venereal transmission cycle among wild swine, which could accidentally involve domestic pigs too. Manipulation of these organs by hunters during slaughtering could also expose them to Leptospira infection. Obtained data add information on Leptospira epidemiology and highlight the importance of wildlife monitoring programs.
