Dengue virus infects millions of people annually and is associated with a high mortality rate. When outbreaks occur, hospitals are often overcrowded with patients. Thus, novel approaches are required to accelerate patient triage for hospitalization, or further intensive care. Machine learning is being widely applied for resolving various problems, including medical diagnosis and outcome prediction. Here, we combined information from patients, including age, sex, and rapid virus test results, to develop a machine learning model for severe outcome prediction. The developed machine learning model displayed good performance for severe dengue disease prediction, and all information required for the model could be easily obtained. We also found that patients who were over 60 years old, who had detectable nonstructural protein-1 from dengue virus, or who had both detectable anti-dengue IgM and IgG antibodies in their sera, had a greater risk of progression to severe dengue. This study established a new approach to predict dengue disease outcomes by applying machine learning and defined the risk factors for severity prediction.
