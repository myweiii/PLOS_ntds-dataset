Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne infectious disease, has become a serious public health problem in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, such as Southeast Asian countries and the Guangdong Province in China. In the absence of an effective vaccine at present, disease surveillance and mosquito control remain the primary means of controlling the spread of the disease. At an intra-urban setting, it is important to predict the spatial distribution of future patients, which can help government agencies to establish precise and targeted prevention measures beforehand. Considering the fast virus spread within a city because of a highly dynamic population flow, we proposed a novel approach to enhancing fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting by integrating spatial interactions of human movements between urban regions. First, using a graph-embedding model called Node2Vec, the embeddings of the regions were learned from their population interaction network so that strongly interacted regions would have more similar embeddings. Secondly, serving as interaction features, the embeddings were combined with the commonly used features as inputs of the forecasting models. The experimental results indicated that the performance of the models can be improved by incorporating the interaction features, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed strategy in enhancing fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting.
