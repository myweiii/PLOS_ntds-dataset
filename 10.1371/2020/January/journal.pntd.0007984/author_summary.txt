Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) remains the most prevalent invasive fungal infection worldwide, with an estimated mortality of 70% in sub-Saharan Africa. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the prevalence, clinical features, case-management and outcome of CM in HIV-infected patients. We also molecularly characterized the Cryptococcus isolates from these patients. The study was conducted in the main hospitals of two geographically distant cities, one located at Antananarivo in the central highlands and the other at Toamasina on the east coast. The prevalence of cryptococcal infection was higher than previously reported global prevalence values, and most of the patients developed CM. Classical signs of meningoencephalitis, including headache, fever and neck pain, were observed, as reported in previous studies. Ninety-day mortality (58.8%) was higher in patients with Cryptococcus infections than in non-infected patients (17.9%). All patients diagnosed with infection were treated with high-dose fluconazole, the only treatment available in Madagascar, in accordance with WHO recommendations. Molecular analyses of isolates from both regions revealed high levels of genome diversity and suggested that further environmental and larger clinical studies would be worthwhile. In conclusion, the prevalence of cryptococcal diseases is high in Madagascar, which is currently faced with the challenges of prioritizing various diseases of public health concern, providing health centers with rapid diagnostic tools and facilitating access to more reliable molecules.
