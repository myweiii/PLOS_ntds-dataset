This systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed that PCR is the most accurate methods for the diagnosis of CL. The summary of the estimates for sensitivity and specificity in all readout methods of the index test were high. No statistically differences between the accuracy in smears, aspirate, skin biopsies or swabs samples suggesting that a simple smears sample run by PCR instead more invasive samples is enough to obtain a positive diagnosis of CL.
