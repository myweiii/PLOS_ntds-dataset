Noma (cancrum oris) is an orofacial gangrene that rapidly disintegrates the hard and soft tissues of the face. Little is known about noma as most cases live in underserved and inaccessible regions. We aimed to assess the language used and beliefs around noma, in northwest Nigeria. Findings will be used to inform prevention programs. Five focus group discussions were held with caretakers of patients with noma admitted to the hospital at the time of interview, and 12 in-depth interviews were held with staff at the hospital. Our study uncovered two main themes: names; descriptions and explanations for the disease, and risks and consequences of noma. Naming of the disease differed between caretakers and heath care workers. Difficulty in accessing care for patients with noma was evident. Barriers to care and lack of knowledge and trust were evident. The impact of noma was not limited to physical presentation; stigmatisation was mentioned as a key difficulty. Differences in disease naming illustrate the difference in beliefs and has an impact on health seeking behaviour, which for noma cases, has severe ramifications due to the rapid progression of the disease.
