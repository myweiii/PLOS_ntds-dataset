Inflammatory responses are crucial in limiting pathogen infections, whereas they often have detrimental effects to the hosts during infectious diseases. Thus, exploring molecules involved in inflammatory responses and targeting those molecules may contribute to development of novel interventions for symptom management during infectious diseases. Although an inflammation-related protein, MRP14, is associated with a wide range of inflammatory diseases, the functions remain elusive. Therefore, we explored the roles of MRP14 in a protozoan disease called leishmaniasis because its pathology is known to be immune-mediated. Interestingly, in two distinct forms of leishmaniases, i.e., cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major and visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani, the molecule showed distinct roles in protection/pathology; although the molecule was protective against L. major infection, depletion of the molecule resulted in easing the pathology during L. donovani infection. These may prove the complexity of MRP14, but at the same time support understanding of the mechanisms behind the complexity.
