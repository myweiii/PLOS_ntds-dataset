Mycetoma, a progressive and disfiguring disease, is one of the neglected tropical diseases, caused by both bacteria and fungi. Eumycetoma is the fungal type and mainly caused by species of the genus Madurella. Madurella mycetomatis is the most prevalent species worldwide. However, other species such as M. fahalii, M. pseudomycetomatis, and M. tropicana can also cause mycetoma and have a different susceptibility towards the drug used for treating mycetoma patients. Currently, we lack a rapid and non-culture-based technique that can readily identify these four species from clinical samples. Due to its sensitivity, and specificity, real-time PCR is re-recognized by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) to directly identify fungal agents from clinical samples. We developed and validated a multiplex real-time PCR-based technique using the least expensive chemistry to identify Madurella species within 3â€“4 hours. Development of such a technique will allow rapid diagnosis of eumycetoma and timely initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy.
