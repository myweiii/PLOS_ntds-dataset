    "Abstract": "In the absence of reliable data on the burden of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in high endemic countries, we established a hospital-based acute jaundice surveillance program in six tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh to estimate the burden of HEV infection among hospitalized acute jaundice patients aged \u226514 years, identify seasonal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of hepatitis E, and examine factors associated with death."
