Leptospirosis is a worldwide disease of humans and animals caused by pathogenic strains of Leptospira spp. These bacteria are transmitted in urine from infected and usually asymptomatic reservoir hosts. Leptospira have been detected in several species of animals in Grenada, and human cases of leptospirosis are reported annually. However, little is known about the source of infection, and while rats are the most commonly recognized reservoir host of Leptospira, there is growing evidence that bats may also be asymptomatic carriers in the wild. To examine this, we captured different species of bats in Grenada, West Indies, from 2015 to 2017, tested kidney tissue for Leptospira spp. bacteria by PCR, and performed histological examination to see whether there is any relationship between Leptospira infection and associated lesions. Our results suggest that two species of bats tested—Artibeus spp. and Glossophaga longirostris—are asymptomatically infected with several types of Leptospira bacteria that may be new to science and that are phylogenetically related to strains that are known to cause disease.
