Chagas disease, an important public health problem in Latin America, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Despite being a widely studied parasite, several questions on the biology of genetic exchange remain unanswered. Population genomic studies have inferred meiosis in T. cruzi, but this cellular division mechanism has not been observed in laboratory yet. In addition, previous results suggest that mitochondrial DNA (called kDNA) may be inherited from both parents in hybrids. Here, we analyzed a hybrid strain and its potential parents to address the mechanisms of genetic exchange at nuclear and mitochondrial levels. We observed that the hybrid strain had heterozygous patterns and DNA content compatible with a meiosis event. Also, we observed that the evolutionary histories of nuclear DNA and kDNA maxicircles were discordant and that the three strains shared identical DNA sequences. Mitochondrial introgression of maxicircle DNA from one genotype to another may explain this observation. In addition, we demonstrated that the hybrid strain shared kDNA minicircles with both parental strains. Our results suggest that hybridization implied meiosis and biparental inheritance of the kDNA. Further research is required to address such phenomena in detail.
