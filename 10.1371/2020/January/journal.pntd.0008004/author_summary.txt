Since 99% of human rabies cases are caused by dog bites, mass dog vaccination campaigns are to be the most efficient method to eradicate the disease. The annual vaccination of over 70% of the population is needed to stop transmission of rabies and reduce the incidence of the disease in human and dog populations. Despite international efforts, rabies continues to be prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, where dog vaccination coverages remain suboptimal. Different communities require different approaches depending on socio-economic and spatial factors. This study describes a mass dog vaccination campaign which achieved homogeneous vaccination coverages of over 70% in 3 districts in southern Malawi, including rural and urban regions, and vaccinated over 89,000 dogs. The dog demographics were studied and compared with reports from other regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Logistic regression models were developed to identify the effect of different factors on coverage. While the influence of several variables on absolute vaccination coverage was determined, only education level and the proportion of young animals were shown to have a significant influence on a region achieving adequate coverage. This study demonstrates the feasibility of vaccinating large number of dogs at high coverage across a wide range of geographical areas in southern Malawi.
