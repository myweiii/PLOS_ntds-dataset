Obesity is a serious and increasing public health problem, and also induces a spectrum of metabolic disorders. Some diseases are known to be more severe in the presence of obesity. However, the interactions of obesity with the immune response to infectious agents have not been fully explored. In this study, we investigated the response of obese mice to infection with Leishmania major. C57BL/6 mice were fed a hypercaloric diet (HSB) and infected afterward with L. major. In obese mice, lesions were ticker and more ulcerative, and cells from draining lymph nodes produced more IL-17 when compared with cells from lean mice fed a control diet. Macrophages from obese and lean mice were infected in vitro and stimulated with IL-17 to test the role of this cytokine in effect produced by obesity. Macrophages from obese mice were more infected by L. major than the macrophages from control mice and the number of parasites was increased by treatment with IL-17. IL-17R deficient mice treated with hypercaloric diet showed no difference in lesion size when compared to mice fed control diet. Our findings suggest that diet-induced obesity decrease the resistance to L. major infection of C57BL/6 mice and the IL-17 cytokine may be involved in the lesion formation.
