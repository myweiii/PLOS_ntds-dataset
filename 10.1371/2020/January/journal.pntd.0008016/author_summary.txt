A typical day for a leprosy patient starts like this. One wakes up and discovers that the ulcer on his left foot has worsened over a few days. Strong odor coming from the wound is disturbing and skin continues to deteriorate but he can’t visit the clinic because it is too far from home and also because he does not have enough money. He leaves the house to beg for money on the streets. As usual, people try to avoid being close to him and stares at him with fear. A typical day for a leprosy patient from Little Flower Hospital Community (LFHC) goes like this. One wakes up from the housing provided by LFHC and discovers that the ulcer on her left foot has worsened over a few days. She visits the hospital nearby and gets her wound checked up by the nurse. She leaves the hospital to work at the dairy farm, which is a job provided by the LFHC. The money that she earns is used to support her and the hospital both. As usual, people in the community greet her with a smile. LFHC created a vast difference in the life of the patient, meeting one’s holistic needs. This research explores how LFHC was able to provide appropriate care for leprosy patients and sustain itself for 35 years. The possibilities of implementing the sustainable model of LFHC to marginalized people in the rest of the world are noteworthy.
