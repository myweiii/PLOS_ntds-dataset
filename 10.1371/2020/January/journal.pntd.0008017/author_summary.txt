Infections of the central nervous system (CNS), though uncommon, are associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, can infect the CNS. We have shown that B. pseudomallei can enter the CNS via peripheral nerves extending between the nasal cavity and the brain (bypassing the blood-brain/blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers). In the current study, we show that prior injury to the olfactory epithelium can increase B. pseudomallei invasion of the olfactory nerve and bulb, highlighting a novel risk factor for CNS infections. We also demonstrate the ability of peripheral nerve glia to internalise B. pseudomallei, resulting in the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs), dependent on the bacterial protein BimA. These findings provide important new insights into the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei.
