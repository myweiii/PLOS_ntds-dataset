Dengue viruses (DENV) are transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes and the disease, known as dengue, occurs throughout the tropics and subtropics. Dengue diagnostic tests rely on a blood sample taken within two weeks of illness onset. Our primary objective was to determine if urine (an easy sample to collect) could be used to detect dengue cases among patients with an acute febrile illness (AFI). Our second objective was to determine if severe dengue was associated with the detection of anti-DENV IgM antibodies in the urine. We found that detecting urine anti-DENV IgM in AFI patients meant that they likely had dengue, that is, it was a highly specific diagnostic test (few false positives). However, a negative urine test did not rule out dengue, that is, it was not a very sensitive test. Anti-DENV IgM in urine was more likely to be detected in the first five days of illness among patients who later developed severe dengue than those with less severe dengue. These findings suggest that the presence of anti-DENV IgM in urine may be useful to diagnose dengue and may indicate more severe disease if done early in the illness. More studies are needed to confirm these results.
