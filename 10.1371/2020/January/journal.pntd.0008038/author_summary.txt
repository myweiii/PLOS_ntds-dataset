Anisakiasis is a human disease caused by ingestion of live Anisakis spp. larvae by raw seafood. Fish processing and aquaculture workers (approximately 60 million people world-wide) are at occupational risk of becoming sensitized to Anisakis. This is the first study systematically evaluating the risk of Anisakis-sensitization in Croatian fish-processing workers and potential genetic susceptibility to anisakiasis in the analysed population. Observed seroprevalence was significantly higher in fish processing workers (1.8%) compared to the controls (0%). Surprisingly, the highest risk associated with Anisakis-sensitization among workers was fishing in their free time, rather than any of attributes related to the occupational exposure. While no association was observed between anti-Anisakis seropositivity and wearing gloves or protective goggles, the majority of workers (92%) wore protective gloves, minimizing the risk for Anisakis sensitization via skin contact. Additionally, seroprevalence to another important food-borne helminth, Trichinella spp. assessed in all Anisakis-positive subjects showed to be negative. Almost all marine fish processing workers in Croatia were part of this research, reflecting real-time Anisakis-sensitization status within the industry. This sets a baseline for the future tracking of sensitization in the sector already under the influence of wide array of allergens.
