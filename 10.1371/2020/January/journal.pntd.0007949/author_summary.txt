Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania infantum, is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The entry of microorganisms into the host is commonly associated with activation of a multiprotein platform called inflammasome whose assembly culminates in caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production. ILβ activates other cells and effector mechanisms leading to clearance of pathogens. However, the involvement of inflammasomes in the human infection with L. infantum is poorly known. To investigate the parasite-host interaction is fundamental to understand the immunopathogenesis of visceral leishmaniasis and to allow the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we used RNA-seq, a tool that allowed to investigate the global gene expression of THP-1 cells, which is a macrophage-like human cell line, infected with L. infantum. By using computational analysis, this approach allowed us to evaluate the expression of genes that compose the inflammasomes pathway and other gene networks and signaling pathways triggered after infection. This analysis indicated that, unlike species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis, L. infantum did not induce the expression of genes of inflammasome pathways, nor caspase-1 activation or IL-1β production, possibly reflecting a parasite strategy to manipulate immune system and therefore, to allow its survival inside the cells.
