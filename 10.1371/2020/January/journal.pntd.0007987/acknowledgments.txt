A special thanks to the inhabitants of the communities we worked in, and to the personnel of the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health, who participated in the collection of the data. We thank Soledad Santillán-Guayasamín, María José Carrasco and Darwin Guerrero to deploy the questionnaire during the visits. Also, to César Yumiseva for the construction of the map and data management and Ileana Araque, for assistance in logistical arrangements.
