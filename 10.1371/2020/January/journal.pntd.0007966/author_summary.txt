A proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial with a four month follow-up period, was conducted to investigate whether ivermectin had an added value in decreasing the frequency of seizures in onchocerciasis-infected persons with epilepsy who were also started on the anti-epileptic drug phenobarbital. The trial showed that ivermectin was not harmful but did not had an added beneficial effect over phenobarbital. A larger study in persons on a stable anti-epileptic treatment regimen with recent epilepsy onset should be considered to further investigate the potential beneficial effect of ivermectin treatment in persons with onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy.
