Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are human filarial tropical diseases, which can cause blindness and severe dermatitis (onchocerciasis) or lymphedema and hydrocele (lymphatic filariasis). Current strategies to eliminate these diseases include the mass drug administration (MDA) of drugs that target the progeny of the filariae, the microfilariae, and temporarily inhibit filarial embryogenesis and, therefore, the transmission of the disease. However, MDA has several limitations that delay the goal of elimination including the lack of a drug with a short term regimen and a potent macrofilaricidal effect. As an alternative approach, the antibiotic doxycycline has been proven to be effective in depleting Wolbachia endosymbionts from adult filariae, which then leads to permanent sterilization and death of the adult worms. Due to contraindications for doxycycline and prolonged treatment regimen of at least 4 weeks, there is an urgent need for new anti-filarial drugs with an improved safety profile and shorter regimens. The current study demonstrates that the boron-pleuromutilin derivative AN11251 provides an excellent in vivo anti-Wolbachia depletion in the Litomosoides sigmodontis filarial mouse model that is superior to doxycycline and comparable to rifampicin, allowing for regimens as short as 10â€“14 days. Combination with doxycycline for 7 days had no significant beneficial effect on efficacy, achieving Wolbachia reductions of more than 97%. Therefore, AN11251 shows potent anti-Wolbachia activity in the L. sigmodontis mouse model and may also present an alternative pre-clinical candidate for filariasis treatment.
