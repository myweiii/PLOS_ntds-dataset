Infections by soil-transmitted worms are common in tropical and subtropical areas. Control strategies usually involve distributing deworming drugs to children, who are most affected. However, recent evidence suggests that distributing these drugs to whole communities, including adults, might help to achieve the elimination of these worms as a public health problem. As part of a large trial in Kenya evaluating the distribution of deworming drugs to communities, we conducted a qualitative study to explore the perspectives of drug delivery among drug distributors and recipient communities. We conducted and analyzed in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. For community deworming to be implemented well, it requires distributors to be highly motivated and follow a plan that fits well with the characteristics of the target community. In order to accept the deworming drugs, communities need to know about the health problem and the intervention, and trust the delivery system. These findings should prove useful to national deworming programs planning to distribute drugs to whole communities when developing their delivery strategies.
