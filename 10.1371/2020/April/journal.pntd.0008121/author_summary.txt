We reviewed bloodstream infections caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella over a 10 year period (2007â€“2017) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with Kisantu in the Kongo Central province as the major sampling site. Non-typhoidal Salmonella were the most common cause of bloodstream infections in children in a sentinel network in DR Congo. The disease mainly occurred in young children and had a high mortality. We showed that non-typhoidal Salmonella persisted to frequently cause bloodstream infections in children under 5 years old. Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium were the main serotypes causing non-typhoidal Salmonella bloodstream infections. The emergence of O5-antigen negative Salmonella Typhimurium (i.e. variant Copenhagen) was observed and this needs to be considered when developing vaccines. Multidrug resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol was widespread during the whole decade. From 2013 onwards, resistance to all other available antibiotics, i.e. third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and azithromycin, emerged. Likewise, extensive drug resistance (multidrug, ceftriaxone and azithromycin co-resistance) and multidrug resistance combined with decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility in Salmonella Typhimurium emerged. Unfortunately, there are no clinical studies on antibiotic treatment in non-typhoidal Salmonella bloodstream infection that could allow the development of evidence based treatment guidelines. Therefore, dedicated observational studies and clinical studies are urgently needed to optimize antibiotic stewardship.
