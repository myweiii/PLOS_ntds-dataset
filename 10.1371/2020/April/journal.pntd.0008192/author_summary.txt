During infection, T. spiralis secretes ES products to modulate host immune responses by suppressing inflammation and stimulating immunoregulatory cells, especially macrophages, which are key in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, we attempt to identify a novel ES-L1-derived immunomodulatory molecule, which can suppress inflammation of LPS-stimulated mBMDMs and promote alternatively activated macrophages (M2). TsCstN, a novel cystatin identified in ES fractions of ES-L1, exhibits immunomodulatory properties on mBMDMs. rTsCstN demonstrated cysteine protease inhibition, specifically to cathepsin L (CatL). The immunomodulatory property of rTsCstN was evaluated by the treatment of LPS-stimulated mBMDM and demonstrated that rTsCstN could suppress inflammation and interfere with antigen processing by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and MHC class II expression (MHC-II) of mBMDMs, respectively. Our finding provides the initiative for explaining the molecular basis of how TsCstN modulates host immune responses, which might be useful for the future development of an alternative treatment against inflammatory diseases.
