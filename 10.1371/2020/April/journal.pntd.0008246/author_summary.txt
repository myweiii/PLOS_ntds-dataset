Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar is a systemic parasitic disease that is endemic in 75 countries with more than 500 million people at risk of infection. VL is caused primarily by the parasites known as Leishmania infantum and Leishmania donovani. It is estimated that VL affects 50,000–90,000 people each year, with 90% of the cases occurring in India, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Brazil. VL is a fatal disease if not treated. Laboratory diagnosis of this disease can be performed using several different approaches. However, there is still a need for a simple, non-expensive, sensitive and specific test that can be used not only for the accurate diagnosis of this serious disease but also to monitor the efficacy of its treatment. Here we describe a new test that can circumvent most of the drawbacks of existing approaches. This new test detects six leishmanial proteins or biomarkers that are eliminated in the urine of patients with VL. The test is a conventional ELISA assembled with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for each of the six different biomarkers and it is performed in urine samples of suspected patients. An initial clinical validation demonstrated that the test has a sensitivity of ≥93% and specificity of 100%. This new and accurate mAb-based multiplexed assay could be a useful resource to diagnose most clinical forms and/or the severity of the disease e.g., active VL, asymptomatic VL, post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, VL/HIV co-infection, etc.
