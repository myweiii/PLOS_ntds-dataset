Trichinellosis has been regarded as a re-emerging or emerging disease, and it is distributed worldwide. Studies investigating T. spiralis ES protein are beneficial to explore potential molecular targets for anti-T. spiralis vaccines. The functions of aspartic protease have been studied in other parasites and demonstrated to be crucial for their parasitism in the host. However, the functions of T. spiralis aspartic protease have not been reported. Here, we expressed and purified a T. spiralis aspartic protease-2 (TsASP2). Our results showed that TsASP2 was expressed in all T. spiralis developmental stages other than NBL and located in the hindgut, midgut and muscle cells of ML and IIL, as well as in areas surrounding embryos within the female uterus. The rTsASP2 possessed aspartic protease activity and functioned to cleave hemoglobin, collagen and IgM. Silencing of the TsASP2 gene could significantly decrease the aspartic protease activity in muscle larva crude proteins, larval invasion of IECs and worm development in the host. We conclude that TsASP2 plays an important role in T. spiralis penetration into host intestinal epithelial cells and could be a candidate vaccine target molecule against T. spiralis infection.
