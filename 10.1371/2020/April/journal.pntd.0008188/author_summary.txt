There are numerous drawbacks in the fight against leishmaniasis which includes difficulty in drug administration, lengthy time of treatment, high toxicity, adverse side effects, high cost of drugs and increasing parasite resistance to treatment. These have made the search for new antileishmanial chemotherapeutics very essential. The Medicine for Malaria Venture (MMV) with the aim of accelerating drug development for poverty-related diseases has assembled some 400 diverse, drug-like molecules active against neglected diseases called the Pathogen box compounds. Thus, in this study we explored the antileishmanial potency and elucidated some possible mechanisms of action of some of the compounds against the Leishmania donovani parasites. The six compounds studied caused a distortion in the mitochondrion morphology, loss of kinetoplastid DNA and eventual nuclear degeneration upon treatment for 72 hours. Parasites treated with two of the cytocidal compounds MMV676057 (E03C) and MMV688942 (D06A) showed no significant programmed cell death due to apoptosis when compared to the untreated parasites but rather showed a cell cycle growth arrest in the G0-G1 and S-phases.
