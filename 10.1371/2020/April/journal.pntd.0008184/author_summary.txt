Evidence on epidemiologic similarities between Strongyloides stercoralis and hookworms was confirmed by our group. A systematic bibliographic search of surveys published between 2001 and 2018 was carried out. Results suggested that the prevalence and burden of infections by hookworms could be used as a proxy to estimate S. stercoralis infections. This approach is based on a linear relationship between the burden of these species. In addition, the models and linearity showed a better fit for surveys using diagnostic methods with high sensitivity for both species. Our estimate of 386 million people infected with S. stercoralis globally, provides an update of the burden of S. stercoralis. This implies an estimate of almost four times higher than what was estimated previously. Our approach allows evidence-based approximation to the estimations of the global burden of S. stercoralis infections, for different age groups and geographic regions. This information highlights the hidden burden of S. stercoralis while also contributing in the estimation of the potential need for ivermectin for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases.
