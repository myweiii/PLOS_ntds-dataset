Chagas disease, which is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major public health problem throughout Latin America. Attempts to develop a vaccine have been hampered by technical difficulties in monitoring the extremely low parasite burden during the life-long chronic stage of infection. To circumvent these issues, we used highly sensitive bioluminescence imaging to assess the ability of recombinant viral vector vaccines and drug-cured infections to confer protection against experimental challenge in mice. We observed that drug-cured infections were much more effective than subunit vaccines. Efficacy was independent of the route of infection or size of the challenge inoculum, and was undiminished after almost a year. In addition, drug-cured infections conferred a high level of cross-strain protection. The highly sensitive imaging procedures enabled us to visualise parasite distribution in mice where full protection was not achieved. This suggested that to confer protection, vaccines must prevent the infection of organs/tissues that act as parasite reservoirs during the chronic stage. Once established at these sites, parasites become largely refractory to vaccine-induced elimination.
