Scabies occasionally presents in atypical forms causing a delay in diagnosis, which can lead to the outbreaks in residential and nursing care for elderly people. We hypothesized that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of Sarcoptes scabiei DNA directly has higher sensitivity than microscopic examination. Recently, clinical consensus criteria have been proposed by the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies (IACS) to overcome the low sensitivities of conventional diagnostic tests for scabies. We thus evaluated the diagnostic capability of in-house real-time PCR for the diagnosis of scabies from skin scraping in subjects with suspected scabies and with unrelated disease according to the criteria of the IACS. We found that the diagnostic sensitivity of scabies PCR maintained between 86% and 80% as the level of diagnostic certainty by the IACS criteria decreased, while the diagnostic sensitivity of microscopic examinations decreased from 100% to 73% as the level of diagnostic certainty by the IACS criteria decreased. Our data suggested that our in-house scabies PCR test was a useful adjunct in the improvement for the diagnosis of scabies by the consensus criteria.
