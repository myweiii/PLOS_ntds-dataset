Dengue virus is transmitted into the skin of humans by mosquitoes as they take a blood meal. In contrast, many animal models are infected in the laboratory using a syringe to inject below the skin. Here, we looked at how different routes and methods of infection altered dengue infection in rhesus macaques. We found that infection via mosquito feeding resulted in a number of changes compared to other routes and methods, including a delay in the time to detection of dengue virus and overall greater quantities of dengue virus in the blood, and changes in the amounts of various components of blood that have been associated with dengue disease in humans. After 15 months, we exposed the macaques again to either the same or a different type of dengue virus. We found that animals exposed to the same type of dengue virus were protected from infection, whereas those animals exposed to a different type were only partially protected. Overall, our results show that dengue virus delivery using the natural transmission vector, mosquitoes, results in infection that is closer to what is observed in humans and may influence the interpretation of future studies of candidate vaccines.
