Scabies is a parasitic infestation which affects about 455 million people annually, with a particularly high prevalence in low income tropical regions. The disease is frequently complicated by bacterial infections. Currently available treatments do not meet the ideal profile which includes miticides, ovicidal, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory/antipruritic properties. Cymbopogon citratus is a plant widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. The essential oil from C. citratus is known as lemongrass oil with reported antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. We conducted experiments to assess the miticidal and ovicidal efficacy of lemongrass oil against Sarcoptes mites collected from naturally infected rabbits in China. The results demonstrated that lemongrass oil can kill the motile stages of Sarcoptes mites effectively and presented a significant ovicidal activity. Considering all these properties, lemongrass oil should be considered a promissing miticide against scabies.
