Urticaria remains a major problem in terms of aetiology, investigation, and management. It seems that some parasitic diseases could be causes of urticaria. Although there is no definitive consistent link between both entities, several studies have shown a significant positive association between parasite infections, mainly helminthic infections, and urticaria. The study of prevalence data for the most relevant Ascarididae infections in our region in different groups (healthy general population, respiratory allergy patients and patients with urticaria), through the measure of specific IgE and IgG antibodies against crude and molecular antigens of Anisakis and Toxocara, allowed us to define some antigenic markers that can be used to discriminate urticaria patients from the control individuals.
