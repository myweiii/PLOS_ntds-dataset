Brucellosis is a neglected, debilitating disease transmitted from livestock to people through direct contact with animal birth or abortion products or through the consumption of raw animal products, particularly milk. The febrile Brucella agglutination test (FBAT), a low-cost laboratory test for brucellosis, is widely used in health facilities throughout East Africa. Previous studies have shown this test has poor diagnostic specificity, contributing to high levels of overdiagnosis in low brucellosis prevalence settings. In this study, we compared the performance of the FBAT with real-time PCR in a high brucellosis prevalence setting in Ijara, Kenya. Our findings suggest very low FBAT diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, which could contribute to brucellosis cases being both missed and over-diagnosed in settings where the disease is common. The use of this test should therefore be phased out. Local epidemiological information can assist diagnostic decision making for brucellosis while awaiting replacement with more accurate tests. In the town of Ijara, at the time of the study, livestock ownership did not predict brucellosis risk. Rather, consumption of milk purchased from local shops and the market and not boiling milk before consumption were the most important predictors of acute disease. These findings also suggest public health interventions in the milk marketing chain could substantially reduce the incidence of human brucellosis.
