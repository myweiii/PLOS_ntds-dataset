    "Abstract": "CD4+ T cells play critical roles in mediating adaptive immunity to a variety of pathogens. Recently, new subset of CD4+T named as T helper 9 cells that express the prototypical interleukin-9 (IL-9) cytokine have been recognized in human and mice models during different parasitic infections. Haemonchus contortus is a gastrointestinal nematode of small ruminants which cause high mortality in young animals. During infection, Excretory and Secretary Products (ESPs) are released in the host body. No other study has reported yet on immunomodulatory dynamics of H. contortus ESPs on Th9 immune response in vitro or in vivo. In this study, immunomodulatory effects of ESPs (5, 10, 20, 40, 80; \u03bcg/mL) incubated with goat PBMCs on Th9 cells, IL-9 immune response and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling regulator were evaluated in vitro. Moreover, for in vivo study, goats were infected with different doses (P-800, P-2400, and P-8000) of H. contortus infective larva (L3) and immunomodulatory effects on Th9 cells, IL-9 immune response and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling regulator were evaluated at 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 28 Days Post Infection (DPI). Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate the effects on Th9 cells and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the IL-9 cytokine transcription level. Additionally, fecal egg counting was also performed in parallel to confirm the infection. All goats were dewormed at 29 DPI and all experiments were also performed at 35 DPI, one week post deworming. The finding indicated that 10, 20, 40, 80 \u03bcg/mL concentration of ESPs incubated with goat PBMCs showed significant increase in the production of Th9 cells, signature cytokine IL-9 and expression of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling regulator as compared to control group in vitro.All infected groups showed significant increase in production of Th9 cells and IL-9 cytokine and expression of TGF-\u03b2/Smad key genes at 18, 21, and 28 DPI as compared to control group. Likewise, at 14 DPI, P-2400 and P-8000 groups showed significant increase in production of Th9 cells, IL-9 cytokine and expression of TGF-\u03b2/Smad key genes. While at 10 DPI, production of Th9 cells and IL-9 was significantly increased in P-2400 & P-8000 groups, and at 7 DPI only P-8000 showed significantly increase in IL-9 production. No immunomodulatory effects were observed at 0 and 3 DPI. Additionally, significant gradually up-regulated key genes expression of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling regulator in all infected groups confirmed the above results. After deworming, production of Th9 cells, associated immune response and expression of signaling regulator in each group were significantly decreased. Based on this study, it is concluded that Th9 immune response was induced during H. contortus infection in goat by up-regulation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling key genes."
