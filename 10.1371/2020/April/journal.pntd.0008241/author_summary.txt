HTLV-1 infection is most prevalent in developing countries, and in Brazil, it is most prevalent in poor black communities. The majority of infected people are asymptomatic, but a minority can develop adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and/or infective dermatitis associated with HTLV-1 (IDH), the subject of this study. IDH is an exudative chronic eczema that always involves the scalp and retroauricular regions and is characterized by its prompt response to antimicrobial therapy. First described in Jamaican children in the sixties, only in 2001 adulthood onset of IDH was reported, and since then little literature has been produced concerning it. Thus, we aimed to provide a thorough description of this relatively new subtype of IDH, investigating its clinical, pathological and molecular aspects, comparing them to juvenile IDH. Apart from minor differences, such as involvement of extra body sites and earlier onset of HAM/TSP, adulthood IDH is very similar to its juvenile counterpart, and the same diagnostic criteria can be applied to both.
