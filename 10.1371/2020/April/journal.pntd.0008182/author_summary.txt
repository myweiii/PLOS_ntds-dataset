The human filarial parasites are responsible for two major debilitating diseases; lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) and onchocerciasis (river blindness). Both have been identified as diseases that can be eliminated as a public health problem. However, the current elimination programs rely upon prolonged distribution of a limited number of drugs, a process which is logistically difficult to accomplish and may encourage the development of resistance. Thus, more effective drugs are needed. In other infectious diseases, in vivo imaging systems (IVIS) have proven to be very effective tools to study the pathogenesis of infection and to develop rapid and non-invasive assays for new drugs. Here we report the adaptation of IVIS to a human filarial parasitic infection and demonstrate in principal that it may be used to non-invasively monitor the efficacy of anti-filarial treatment in vivo. This system should prove useful as an in vivo screen for new anti-filarial compounds, as well as studies of the basic biology of these parasites.
