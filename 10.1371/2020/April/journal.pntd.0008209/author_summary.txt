Dengue, a vector-borne disease spread by Aedes mosquitoes, is a global threat. In countries where dengue vaccine is not authorized due to safety concerns and is not cost effective, vector control is the key intervention tool. A good understanding of Aedes habitats is essential to facilitate resource planning and community awareness to moderate dengue transmission. In this study, we used larvae surveillance data from Singapore, to examine the distribution, long term trend and seasonality of Aedes habitats in residences and public areas. We also studied the seasonality of climate factors to understand their influence on the Aedes habitats. The most frequently reported Aedes-positive containers were domestic containers, drains, discarded receptacles, ornamental containers, flower pot plates/trays, plants, gully traps, canvas/plastic sheet, bins, ground puddle, inspection chambers and roof tops/gutters. Residences had more Ae. aegypti-positive containers per inspection whereas public areas had more Ae. albopictus-positive containers per inspection. We also found that mean temperature influenced the detection of Aedes habitats. This study demonstrates the seasonal fluctuations of Aedes-positive containers in an urban environment.
