Since immemorial times, Mycobacterium leprae inflicts permanent injuries in human kind, within a wide symptomatic spectrum ranging from insensitive skin patches to disabling physical lesions. Innate resistance to this parasite is well recognized, but poorly understood. The complement system is one of the most important arms of the innate response, and several lines of evidence indicate that it may be usurped by the parasite to enhance its entrance into host cells. These include our recent work on genetic association of the disease with lectin pathway components and the complement receptor CR1, whose polymorphisms modulate susceptibility to infection and clinical presentation. Here, we add another pivotal piece in the leprosy parasite-host interaction puzzle: polymorphisms and serum levels of three different lectin pathway proteins, all encoded by the same gene, namely mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease 1 (MASP1). We found lower levels of two of these proteins, MASP-3 and MAp44, in leprosy patients. Higher MASP-3/lower MASP-1 levels were associated with protective haplotypes, containing two side-by-side polymorphisms located in the exclusive untranslated region of MASP-3 exon 12, which may regulate exon splicing and/or translation efficiency. The associations revealed in this study reflect the pleiotropic nature of this gene. They further illustrate the complexity of the response mounted against the parasite, which places MASP1 products in the regulatory crossroad between the innate and adaptive arms of the immunological system, modulating leprosy susceptibility.
