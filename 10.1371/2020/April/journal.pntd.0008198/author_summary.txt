The Eritrean Pharmacovigilance centre, since its integration in Mass Drug Administration in 2017, has been receiving large proportion of reports of adverse drug reactions associated with the drug praziquantel administered in mass drug campaigns. Of note were reports of the visual abnormalities namely blurred vision and visual impairment which are not known to be related to the drug. On a probability assessment, the series of 61 cases seems to show a reasonable link between the reported adverse reactions and praziquantel but not an absolute cause and effect relationship. This study suggests inaccuracies in the dose of praziquantel, in reference to some African studies, as a possible root cause, that might have led to overdosing of some subjects and hence the occurrence of the reported reactions in noticeable rates. It also addresses primarily a public health issue, rendering the findings interesting to both the scientific and non-scientific communities in general and disease control programs in particular. It is a driving force to conduct further research, improve our understanding of praziquantel and its safety profile, and the use of the drug in better ways.
