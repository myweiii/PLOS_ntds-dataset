    "Abstract": "Giardiasis and other protozoan infections are major worldwide causes of morbidity and mortality, yet development of new antimicrobial agents with improved efficacy and ability to override increasingly common drug resistance remains a major challenge. Antimicrobial drug development typically proceeds by broad functional screens of large chemical libraries or hypothesis-driven exploration of single microbial targets, but both strategies have challenges that have limited the introduction of new antimicrobials. Here, we describe an alternative drug development strategy that identifies a sufficient but manageable number of promising targets, while reducing the risk of pursuing targets of unproven value. The strategy is based on defining and exploiting the incompletely understood adduction targets of 5-nitroimidazoles, which are proven antimicrobials against a wide range of anaerobic protozoan and bacterial pathogens. Comprehensive adductome analysis by modified click chemistry and multi-dimensional proteomics were applied to the model pathogen Giardia lamblia to identify dozens of adducted protein targets common to both 5\u2019-nitroimidazole-sensitive and -resistant cells. The list was highly enriched for known targets in G. lamblia, including arginine deiminase, \u03b1-tubulin, carbamate kinase, and heat shock protein 90, demonstrating the utility of the approach. Importantly, over twenty potential novel drug targets were identified. Inhibitors of two representative new targets, NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase and peroxiredoxin, were found to have significant antigiardial activity. Furthermore, all the identified targets remained available in resistant cells, since giardicidal activity of the respective inhibitors was not impacted by resistance to 5\u2019-nitroimidazoles. These results demonstrate that the combined use of click chemistry and proteomics has the potential to reveal alternative drug targets for overcoming antimicrobial drug resistance in protozoan parasites."
