Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that results in more than 100,000 deaths every year. Haemotoxicity is one of the most common signs of systemic envenoming observed after snakebite, and many snake venoms cause severe impairment of the blood coagulation that makes victims vulnerable to suffering life-threating hemorrhage. In this study, we applied a combination of analytical and pharmacological methods to identify snake venom toxins from a wide diversity of snake species that interfere with blood coagulation. Twenty snake venoms were screened for their effects on the blood coagulation cascade and based on the initial results and the medical relevance of the species, seven venoms were selected for in-depth analysis of the responsible toxins using advanced identification techniques. Our findings reveal a number of anticoagulant toxins that have not yet been reported before as such. The methodology described herein not only enables the identification of both known and unknown toxins that cause impairment of the blood coagulation, but offers a throughput platform to effectively screen for inhibitory molecules relevant for the development of next generation snakebite treatments.
