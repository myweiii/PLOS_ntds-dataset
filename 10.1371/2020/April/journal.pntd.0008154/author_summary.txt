Mutations in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Vssc) gene in Aedes aegypti can confer resistance to insecticides and threaten vector control programs. To date, twelve Vssc mutations have been identified in pyrethroid resistant A. aegypti populations, and F1534C, V1016G/I, S989P and V410L commonly are found alone or in combination. However, the evolutionary dynamics of how alleles came to have multiple mutations is less known. In this study, we found 1534C and 989P+1016G alleles were widely distributed in Asian populations. In contrast, the distinct 410L, 410L+1534C, 410L+1016I+1534C and 1534C alleles were distributed in populations from the Americas. The 410L+1534C allele appears to have arisen by accumulation of the 410L mutation in an individual already having the 1534C allele or by a crossover event. The 410L+1016I+1534C arose by additional mutations from 1534C background. Our data corroborates previous geographic distributions of resistance mutations and provides evidence for both recombination and sequential accumulation of mutations contributing to the molecular evolution of resistance mutations in A. aegypti.
