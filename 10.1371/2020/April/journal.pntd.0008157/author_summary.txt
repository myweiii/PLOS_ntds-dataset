We show that the wMel strain of Wolbachia can be deployed successfully into mosquito populations in an area of intense dengue transmission in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Deployment was achieved through either the release of eggs or adult mosquitoes with full community support. This represents the successful first step toward a large trial to evaluate the use of Wolbachia in Indonesia to disrupt transmission of arboviruses such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya.
