Intestinal parasites can cause diarrhea in children, being most reported in developing countries, such as Mozambique. Mozambique dual high burden of HIV and malnutrition poses an ideal setting for parasites occurrence. To date, little information is published regarding intestinal parasites in children (0–168 months) in Mozambique, most of the published information focus on children under fifty-nine months and focus Mozambique’s South region. We determine Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica frequency in the three regions of Mozambique in children hospitalized with diarrhea and we identified factors that are associated with intestinal parasite infections. Cryptosporidium spp. infection was the most common parasite among children in this study, with an occurrence of one in ten. The percentage of children infected with Cryptosporidium spp. decreased with age. G. lamblia was the second more common parasite, being the number of members in the household a predictor for its occurrence in children. E. histolytica was the less common of them all although it was found in all studied provinces. Our study highlights the burden of most common intestinal protozoans found in children (0–168 months) hospitalized due to diarrhea.
