Recently, the World Health Organisation recognized mycetoma, a chronic, progressively destructive morbid inflammatory disease usually of the foot as a neglected tropical disease. However, mycetoma is not a notifiable disease and thus the global burden of the disease remains poorly defined. It is therefore important that any collection of available data on this disease is brought forward to highlight the extent and magnitude of the burden of mycetoma. We retrospectively gathered data on the burden and aetiology of mycetoma in a country (Uganda) within the mycetoma belt based on histological diagnosis and systematic review. We found that fungal pathogens are the most common cause of mycetoma in this region. However, the distribution of the lesions is consistent with global data with the foot being the most affected site. We also noticed that clinicians have low index of clinical suspicion for mycetoma leading to under-diagnosis. Mycetoma is uncommon but not rare in Uganda; more research is obligatory to precisely define the distribution and determinants of the disease as well as primary and secondary preventative measures in endemic areas.
