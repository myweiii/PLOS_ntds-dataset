Endemicity of DENV in some places of southern Bhutan has been established previously. In this study, we analysed outbreaks of DF that occurred in 3 places over a period of 2 years, 1 of which was previously not known to be endemic to DENV. Serum specimens collected from patients suspected of having DF were analyzed in the Royal Centre for Disease Control (RCDC) in Bhutan and in Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS), Thailand. DENV-1 and 2 were established as the causes of the outbreaks, also indicating that serotypes of DENV circulating in the country over the past years have remained the same. Our analyses reveal that the current DENV-1and DENV-2 in Bhutan probably originated from India, Bhutanâ€™s closest neighboring country.
