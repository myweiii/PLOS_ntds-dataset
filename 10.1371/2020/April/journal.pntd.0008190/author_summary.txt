Although grain formation is the hallmark of mycetoma, so far the pathways leading to grain formation were not studied. Since our hypothesis is that both host and pathogen play a role in this process, we aimed to study this process in a model system. Grains can be formed in the invertebrate Galleria mellonella and different stages of grain formation can be noted within the larvae. We therefore infected G. mellonella with the mycetoma causative agent Madurella mycetomatis, and monitored grain formation over time. At day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-inoculation, grains and hemolymph were obtained from infected larvae. Proteins were isolated and identified by label-free mass spectrometry. By analyzing the proteins found in both host and pathogen on the different time points, we were able to develop a grain model over time. This grain model can in the future be used to identify novel treatments for this difficult to treat infection.
