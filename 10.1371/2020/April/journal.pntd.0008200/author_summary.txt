The Governmental health system in Bangladesh is free to the general public but given the huge burden (4â€“5 times hospital capacity), the Governmental hospitals are always overcrowded, and infection control is minimal. Antibiotics are used empirically to manage infections and invariably offered to all patients admitted. Outbreaks are a regular phenomenon in the public hospitals of Bangladesh which are rarely fully analysed. Herein, we report a B. cepacia outbreak from a burn unit for a protracted period where the patients were treated with inappropriate antibiotic therapies. B. cepacia is a Gram-negative bacterium, mostly a lung pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients but can also produce infections in immunosuppressed patients. The epidemiology and molecular data from the outbreak strains indicate the need for interventions and improved infection control programs to manage outbreaks in Bangladeshi hospitals.
