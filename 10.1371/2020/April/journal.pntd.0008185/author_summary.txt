Besides cure rates, egg reduction rates represent an important indicator of anthelminthic drug efficacy in clinical trials. However, there is an ongoing controversy whether the arithmetic or the geometric mean should be used for its calculation. The arithmetic mean is problematic in skewed distributions mainly because the mean is sensitive to outliers, whereas the geometric mean does not correspond to our intuitive interpretation of average reduction. Several studies tried to compare the performance of different means but they relied on assumptions, which favored one approach over another. Despite the ongoing debate, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the arithmetic mean to calculate egg reduction rates. To overcome limitations from previous studies, we visualized data from several clinical trials and asked a panel of experts to compare drug efficacy of two different treatments. Afterwards, we estimated efficacy by using different means. Finally, we calculated the raw agreement between expert opinion and the different means. From all investigated methods to calculate efficacy, the arithmetic mean showed the poorest performance in terms of agreement with expert opinion. In anthelminthic human drug trials, which are characterized by small sample size and non-adherence, estimates more robust to outliers should be reported to assess drug efficacy performance.
