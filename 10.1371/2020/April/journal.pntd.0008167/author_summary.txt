Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. These intracellular parasites replicate inside phagolysosomes of the macrophages and have evolved mechanisms that allow survival within the hostile environment of their hosts. They have evolved strategies to dramatically modify the transcriptome and proteome content of the host cells they infect, facilitating their survival within the host cell. Here, we have defined a mechanism by which Leishmania donovani subverts host cell defense genes by manipulating the epigenetic control of defense gene expression. The intracellular protozoan parasite, Leishmania, results in gene silencing of innate host defense genes. The underlying molecular mechanisms assisting such modifications were inferred from the results. An increase in the transcript, protein levels and activity of host HDAC1 was observed at 6 h post-infection. This data confirms the role of HDAC1 in the silencing of the host defense genes and enabling the intracellular survival of the parasite. Our results decode a new insight into epigenetic regulation of host cell defense mechanisms. These findings will facilitate the identification of novel strategies and will promise newer ways to control parasite growth.
