Rodents are considered as the main reservoirs of pathogenic leptospires, which can cause leptospirosis, a disease that can be severe for both humans and domestic animals. Multiple socio-environmental factors have been found to influence the risk of leptospirosis, and many mammal species can play a role in the transmission of the bacteria. The purpose of this study was to investigate the local conditions and rodent fauna that may influence the risk of leptospirosis in communities located in the floodplains of the Parana river, near Santa Fe, Argentina. We conducted a survey of antibodies against leptospires in rodents from the center, border, and outside of three riverside settlements. We observed a relatively high seroprevalence among captured individuals (42%). Animals with an intermediate body condition were more likely to be seropositive. In most sites, native rodents were dominant over introduced rats and mice and lived close to human dwellings. Given the socio-environmental conditions observed in these settlements and the high frequency of floods that affect them, the presence of potentially infected rodents provide ample opportunities for leptospirosis to affect these communities.
