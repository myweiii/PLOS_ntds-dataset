Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. In China, the sole intermediate snail host is Oncomelania hupensis whose elimination has proved to be the most effective way to interrupt this disease. However, manual snail-searching is labour-intensive, expensive and time-consuming and can lead to inaccurate results. For a better approach, 12 models were employed and compared to characterise the typical snail habitats that vary between the lake/marshlands and the hilly areas. We found that the two types of snail habitats showed notable differences during the modelling process, mainly due to the impact of environmental variables that can form different types of habitats. We further found that habitat characterization contributed to better prediction of areas at risk, and that the precision was high, especially of models based on machine-learning algorithms such as random forest (RF). The highest level of accuracy was achieved by the support vector machine (SVM) approach and artificial neural networks (ANN). Our study provides new insights into accurate prediction of the spatial distribution of potential snail habitats with machine-learning as the preferred approach.
