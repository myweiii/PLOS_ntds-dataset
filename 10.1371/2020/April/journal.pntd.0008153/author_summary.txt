Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) affect an estimated 1.5 billion people globally. The DeWorm3 Project is investigating if it is possible to interrupt transmission of STH with community-wide deworming of individuals of all ages. We conducted focus group discussions with adult men, women, and community drug distributors (CDDs) in Com√©, Benin to identify gender-specific facilitators and barriers to accessing and participating in community-wide mass drug administration (MDA) programs. Our findings suggest that door-to-door community-wide MDA may not only improve MDA treatment coverage by increasing access but may also empower women by facilitating increased decision making on behalf of their regarding who is treated and where. Additionally, women may be an untapped resource for strategically reaching missed populations and women reported seeking increased involvement within the deworming of their families. Men did not perceive themselves to be at risk and thus did not have high demand for deworming. Both genders reported that they struggle to afford deworming drugs outside of MDA and that MDA coverage would be higher if treatment was integrated with water and sanitation services. Finally, CDDs generally identified only barriers and facilitators to MDA that were shared by both genders and may require more training to ensure MDA programs are equitable and effectively engage all at risk populations.
