In the context of Guyana, people’s self-reported behavior (i.e. use of vector control tools) is based on their risk perception and on their knowledge of the disease if the risk perception is high enough (i.e. for malaria and dengue fever). Measures donated by the government, such as bed nets, are widely reported to be used and their use is less likely to be contingent on the perceived risk. In other words, because those measures are donated, they are more likely to be used regardless of the risk perception. The type of region in which individuals live also plays a key role on the adoption of vector control measures: although people living in the hinterland tend to have greater knowledge about the disease and an accurate risk perception, they use fewer preventive measures than people living in the coastal regions–thus pointing to the importance of promoting access to preventive measures in the hinterland. Therefore, in trying to reach the elimination of vector-borne diseases, it is essential for the government to promote awareness of the risks and facilitate (i.e. donate) access to preventive measure to avoid a reduced usage of vector control measures arising from a lower risk perception.
