If a mother contracts the Zika Virus during pregnancy, there is a risk of the child developing Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), which can lead to feeding difficulties due to swallowing and choking. It is therefore important to understand the lived experiences of those who support infants who have contracted CZS, so that infant feeding can be improved. The review and synthesis identified only a small number of relevant CZS qualitative studies (n = 6), all from Brazil (the ‘direct’ evidence). As a result, the review was expanded to include qualitative studies of the lived experience of mothers and others regarding infant feeding in the presence of similar physical problems, e.g. Cerebral Palsy (the ‘indirect’ evidence, n = 8). The phenomenon of interest was the same, though the underlying conditions were different. Both the direct and indirect evidence documented parental fear, anxiety and uncertainty around the problems they faced; the difficulties for maternal-child bonding; the potential value of training; and emphasised the perception that health professionals were poorly equipped to provide relevant information and advice. In particular, mothers wanted the specific feeding difficulties of their children to be taken into account when receiving advice and counselling. This synthesis has informed the WHO infant feeding guidelines.
