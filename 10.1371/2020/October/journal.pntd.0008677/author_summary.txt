Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in young children worldwide. In low-resource settings, laboratory testing is not available or too expensive, and the decision to prescribe antibiotics is often made without testing. Using clinical information to predict which cases are caused by viruses, and thus wouldnâ€™t need antibiotics, would help to improve appropriate use of antibiotics. We used data from a large study of childhood diarrhea, paired with advanced statistical methods including machine learning, to come up with the top clinical factors that could predict a viral cause of diarrhea. We compared 1049 cases where a virus was the only cause, with 2317 cases where the cause was known but not a virus. We found that a lower age, dry and cold season, nutritional status defined by increased height, lack of blood diarrhea, and vomiting, were the clinical factors most predictive of whether the diarrhea was caused by a virus. We found that, using just those 5 factors, we were able to predict a viral cause with good accuracy. Our findings can be used by doctors to guide the appropriate use of antibiotics for diarrhea in children.
