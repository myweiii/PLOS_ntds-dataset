Target-based drug discovery strategies hold the promise to discover safer and more effective treatments for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). Genetic manipulation techniques have been used to successfully identify essential genes in eukaryotic parasites. Unfortunately, the fact that a gene is essential under controlled laboratory conditions does not automatically make the corresponding gene-product vulnerable to pharmacological intervention in a clinical setting within the human host. To allow the discovery and development of small molecule tool compounds that can be used to validate pharmacologically vulnerable targets, one must first establish compound screening assays and obtain structural information for the candidate target. Eukaryotic cells lacking deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) function are not viable. DHS catalyzes the first step in a post-translational modification that is critical for the function of eIF5A. Presence of mature eIF5A is also essential for eukaryotic cell viability. Here we reported compound screening assays (yeast-based for Brugia malayi and Leishmania major; in vitro for B. malayi only) and provided further regulatory and structural insights we hope will aid in the identification and development of inhibitors for the DHS enzymes from two NTD-causing organismsâ€”B. malayi, the causative agent of lymphatic filariasis and L. major, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
