Infection with the single-celled parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) is thought to be lifelong. However, only a third of infected people develop Chagas cardiomyopathyâ€“the main disease manifestation. This may reflect the different extent to which individuals control the parasite, with some potentially clearing it entirely. In chronically infected immunocompetent patients, a marker of parasite burden is the quantity of antibody against T. cruzi in the blood: more parasite, more immune stimulation, more antibody. In this study we show how antibody levels change over many years in a cohort of untreated patients with Chagas disease. We find that among individuals with falling or low/borderline antibody levels there was a lower rate of parasite detection in the blood and a lower rate of cardiomyopathy. 60% of subjects with falling antibody levels had no evidence of active disease, twice as many as among patients with other antibody trajectories (stable or rising). Our findings support an account of the natural history of Chagas disease in which a proportion of those infected achieve a greater control of the parasite, with some individuals potentially clearing it completely.
