Yellow fever (YF) is a vector-borne disease and from December 2016 until 2020, caused infection and death in humans and monkeys in the Southeast and South of Brazil. The transmission cycle includes hosts and vectors whose presence and abundance are driven by environmental conditions. Ecological niche models are expected to identify biotic and abiotic conditions favourable to a species and to predict its likelihood of presence. Such models have shown their relevance to determine the environmental and anthropogenic variables favourable for host and vector species of infectious diseases, and consequently for highlighting more at-risk areas. Relying on human and monkey populations, we showed how temperature, rain, predicted mammal density, human impact, and vaccination coverage explained the occurrence of YF cases in 2017â€“2018 Brazilian epidemics. We predicted at-risk areas for future outbreaks, including areas outside and surrounding the Amazon basin, YF cases occurring later, in 2019 and 2020, were observed in the predicted at-risk areas using our modelling approach. This modelling approach, relying on ecology theory and methodological framework for using epidemiological data, helps to identify human threatened populations, for which vaccination efforts should be oriented, and also for monkeys whose preservation is the main biodiversity concern.
