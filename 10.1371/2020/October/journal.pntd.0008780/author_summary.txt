Just as malaria parasites depend on mosquitoes for transmission, Schistosoma trematodes that infect 200+ million people in developing countries depend on freshwater snails to support their development. New control methods targeting schistosomes in the snail host are urgently needed to help break the cycle of transmission. Identification of molecules in snails that confer or facilitate resistance to successful larval development offers one way forward. Building on previous studies and new data, we used a combination of bioinformatics tools to characterize a repertoire of molecules in B. glabrata containing fibrinogen or IgSF domains, or both (the latter molecules called FREPs, first discovered in B. glabrata). We found that snails resistant to schistosomes mount vigorous, multi-component FREP responses following exposure to schistosomes whereas responses of susceptible snails are modest by comparison. Furthermore, for four FREPs repeatedly implicated in snail responses to trematodes, three (FREPs 2, 3.1 and 3.2) exist in distinctive allelic forms in susceptible and resistant snails. We propose that the search for homologous molecules needs to move to the field, to B. glabrata in the Neotropics and to other vector species of Biomphalaria in Africa, to explore the potential of FREPs as resistance factors worthy of development as control agents.
