According to the World Health Organization Leishmaniasis is the second parasitic disease that kills the most in the world; the first is malaria. Despite this, knowledge about the Leishmania parasite and its interaction with vertebrate hosts concerning the transmitting insect is still relatively fewer and fragmented. Studies on insects microbiota have great importance to obtain basic information. How a vector responds to the presence of different microorganisms and how they interact with various pathogens and may lead to the development of new strategies or tools that can be used to prevent or hinder the transmission of the protozoan by the vector insect. Considering the knowledge about the intestinal microbiota of sandflies, we aim to study the effect of bacterial isolates on Lu. longipalpis infection by different species of Leishmania, and it believed that these bacteria might influence the development of Leishmania, preventing, and hindering transmission, contributing to Leishmaniasis control strategies.
