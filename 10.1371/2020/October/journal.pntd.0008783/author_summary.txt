In this study, we assessed whether previous infection with the bacteria Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi protected against second infections. Healthy volunteers who had been previously infected with these bacteria in earlier human challenge studies were challenged for a second time. We compared the rate of infection in the re-challenge group with healthy volunteers who were challenged for the first time. We found that previous infection was associated with a lower rate of second infections and longer time to disease but was not associated with complete protection from disease. Some individuals appeared to be more resistant to developing infection on both occasions. Previous infection with Salmonella Typhi did not appear to protect against later infection with Salmonella Paratyphi and vice-versa. Antibody responses and clinical symptoms were similar in between first and second infections. These results and future studies could help us to better understand immunity to these bacteria and help the development of new vaccines for Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi.
