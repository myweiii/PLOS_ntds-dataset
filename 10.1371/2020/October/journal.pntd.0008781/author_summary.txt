An estimated 50 million cattle in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk of the deadly livestock disease East coast fever (ECF), caused by the parasite Theileria parva, which imposes tremendous economic hardship on smallholder farmers. An existing ECF vaccine protects against strains circulating among cattle, but not against T. parva derived from African Cape buffalo, its main wildlife carrier. Understanding this difference in protective efficacy requires characterization of the genetic diversity in T. parva strains associated with each mammalian host, a goal that has been hindered by the proliferation of T. parva in nucleated host cells, with much larger genomes. Here we adapted a sequence capture approach to target the whole parasite genome, enabling enrichment of parasite DNA over that of the host. Choices in protocol development resulted in nearly 100% parasite genome specificity and sensitivity, making this approach the most successful yet to generate T. parva genome sequence data in a high-throughput manner. The analyses uncovered a degree of genetic differentiation between cattle- and buffalo-derived genotypes that is akin to levels more commonly seen between species. This approach, which will enable an in-depth T. parva population genomics study from cattle and buffalo in the endemic regions, can easily be adapted to other intracellular pathogens.
