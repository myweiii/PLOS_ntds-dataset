Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), is an immune-mediated condition of leprosy.It is a multi-system disorder which can occurbefore, during or after completion of multidrug therapy for leprosy.ENL is often characterised by chronicity and recurrence. Management of ENL requires long-term oral corticosteroids which are associated with adverse effects.Thalidomide is an alternative to steroids, but many centres donot use it in their outpatient clinics due to the significant concern of drug-producing birth defects.This study provides additional evidence of the feasibility of thalidomide treatment in ENL at outpatient settings.
