Lymphedema, a chronic swelling of the limbs, is a consequence of a debilitating and disfiguring neglected parasitic infection known as lymphatic filariasis (LF). In places where LF is common, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a simple and effective hygiene program to improve the quality of life of people living with lymphedema. In places where persons with lymphedema are found, health facilities should have the ability to teach these simple techniques and manage complications. Further, WHO recommends that countries evaluate their lymphedema care services to ensure quality and requires information about lymphedema care when deciding whether to acknowledge that a country has eliminated LF. We developed a tool for use in assessing readiness of health facilities to provide quality lymphedema care, then evaluated the tool in health facilities across three regions of Vietnam, collecting information on 14 factors related to lymphedema care quality. Most facilities had needed supplies and the staff generally understood how to care for persons with lymphedema; however, facilities often lacked patient tracking systems or health education materials. Vietnam used this information to improve lymphedema care services throughout the country and received acknowledgement of LF elimination from WHO in 2018.
