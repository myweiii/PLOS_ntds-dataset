Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease that affect millions of people. Chagas disease is caused by T. cruzi, a protozoan that can be transmitted through insect vectors. Currently, medications for chagas disease are limited and have severe side effects. T. cruzi presents a complex multi-stage life cycle including 3 stages, which poses additional challenges in drug development. In this study, we deepened the understanding of the metabolism of T. cruzi across its life cycle through integrating omics data with GEMs. We reconstructed an updated GEM of T.cruzi with additional subsystems using novel genome annotationsâ€”the number of gene included increased by ~50%. We then generated models for each stage using stage-specific transcriptomics data to model only genes that were expressed at each stage. Simulations of stage-specific models suggest remarkable differences in metabolism across stages of T. cruzi. Gene and pathway essentiality was also predicted to vary greatly across its multi-stage life cycle, some of which were confirmed by previous studies. Our models were verified with experimentally measured enzyme activity at each stage. In conclusion, our results revealed stage-specific differences in metabolism in T. cruz and provided valuable insight into drug discovery.
