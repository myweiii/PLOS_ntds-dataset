Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae). Lipid-enriched intracellular environment is important for the parasitization of M. leprae. During anti-leprosy treatment, chemotherapy-killed bacilli can remain in host tissues for a long time, making it difficult to determine the treatment efficacy by Zeihl-Nelsonâ€™s staining-based bacterial index (BI) test. In this study, we found that host peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling is responsible for modification of intracellular lipid homeostasis to accommodate M. leprae parasitization in host macrophages. In skin smear samples of patients, M. leprae-derived gene expressions were detected both before and after anti-leprosy treatment, whereas human PPAR target gene expressions were dramatically diminished after the treatment. These results further our understanding of M. leprae intracellular parasitization, and suggest that PPAR signaling may be a novel therapeutic target for treating M. leprae infection and monitoring the expressions of certain PPAR target genes in skin lesions may be helpful to evaluate the treatment efficacy and recurrent infection.
