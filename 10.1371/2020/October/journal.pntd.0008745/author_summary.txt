Helminths are a group of intestinal worms that cause abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and anemia due to blood loss in the stool. Regular mass drug administration (MDA) is one strategy to fight these worm infections. The appropriate MDA treatment scheme is chosen based on a population survey estimating the burden of infection. This survey is usually done in schoolchildren because they suffer the most from these infections and they are easy to reach through school infrastructures. However, one particular worm, the hookworm, is also highly present and clinically relevant in adults. We conducted a community-based survey in two districts of the Kwilu Province of the DRC. We found that hookworm was the predominant infection in the area and that adults were as often infected as the schoolchildren. Therefore, to effectively reduce hookworm infection, we advise extending treatment schemes to the entire community.
