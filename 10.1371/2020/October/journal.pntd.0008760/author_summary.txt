Most of the global population is at risk of infection with dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses, all transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes. Although these viruses now circulate together in the Americas, it is not known how, if at all, they might interact inside co-infected vectors or hosts. Such interactions could serve as important determinants of transmission in the context of co-circulation. We used seven years of surveillance data from Fortaleza, the fifth largest city in Brazil, to investigate the potential effects of co-circulation on the transmission dynamics of the three Aedes-borne viruses. We found that, during years with co-circulation, different families of viruses (dengue/Zika and chikungunya) clustered in distinct areas of the city. This spatial clustering of viruses of the same type was maintained even within narrow time intervals. Transmission patterns in epidemic years with co-circulation deviated from patterns in previous epidemic years. Our findings suggest that co-circulation may alter the transmission dynamics of these mosquito-borne viruses. Further research is needed to confirm any competitive interactions between the viruses and to establish evidence-based public health recommendations for concurrent outbreaks.
