We analysed the impact of 6 years of preventive chemotherapy intervention by the Ministry of Health and Child Care of Zimbabwe (MoHCC) to control STH infections in Zimbabwe.
We applied a geostatistical method to analyse the epidemiological data before and after the intervention. The results are interesting because they demonstrate a complete elimination of infection of moderate heavy intensity (that are considered the ones causing most of STH morbidity and a drastic reduction in prevalence that entails an estimated reduction of 90% in the need for anthelminthic medicines to maintain the situation and a consequent reduction in programme costs.
