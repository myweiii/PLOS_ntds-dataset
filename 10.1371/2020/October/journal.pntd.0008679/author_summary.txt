The presence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Madeira Island had recently caused the first local outbreak of dengue in Europe. The island is at risk of another local transmission if triggered by the introduction of the dengue virus by an infected person. Using a mathematical model for the transmission of dengue, we examine the dynamics of a potential epidemic triggered by the arrival of an infected person on the island. We also examine the impact of seasonal temperature variation on the epidemic dynamics. Our results show the potential for summer and autumn season transmission of dengue on the island, and that the arrival date of an infectious person affects the distribution of the timing and peak size of the epidemic. Late summer arrivals were more likely to produce a rapid epidemic. We also show that seasonal temperature variation dramatically affects the epidemic dynamics. With warmer starting temperatures, epidemics peak faster, producing a large final epidemic size. Our model could be useful to estimate the risk of an epidemic outbreak and as a guide for local control and mitigation strategies for dengue on the island.
