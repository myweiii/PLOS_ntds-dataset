Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania. It affects millions of people in endemic areas worldwide distributed among Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. Different species of Leishmania can lead to different forms of infection, including cutaneous and mucosal lesions, comprising, in the Americas, the American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL). Despite the methodologies already developed for the diagnosis of ATL, none of them by itself allows an accurate diagnosis ruling out the false positives, false negatives and enabling parasite load determination at the same time. Moreover, none have performed a proper analytical validation and sampling. So, in this study we compared two qPCR reactions, using 18S rDNA and HSP70 targets, in a proper analytical validation and evaluating a robust set of 88 patient samples from Brazilâ€™s Amazon Region. Our goal is to contribute in a further multicentric study involving the standardization of ATL diagnosis by qPCR.
