Scabies is a highly significant parasitic disease caused by the mite S. scabiei. This NTD has a major adverse impact in disadvantaged communities around the world, particularly when associated with secondary bacterial infections and clinical complications. Here we report the first high-quality genome and transcriptomic data for S. scabiei and explore molecular aspects of S. scabiei/scabies. This genome (56.6 Mb, encoding ~ 9,200 proteins) provides a solid foundation for fundamental investigations of the molecular biology of the mite, host-parasite interactions and disease processes as well as for translational research to develop new treatments, vaccines and diagnostic tests.
