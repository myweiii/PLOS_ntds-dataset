Dengue has become a significant public health concern worldwide in recent years especially for the South-East Asian, sub-Saharan African and Latin American countries. Bangladesh has experienced a number of outbreaks of dengue, the largest one occurred in 2019. Management of dengue cases during an epidemic is a major challenge for a limited resource country like Bangladesh. To predict the risk of developing severe dengue a combined evaluation of early symptoms and laboratory test profiles is necessary. Despite the fact, there is a lack of evidence of clinical and laboratory parameters of dengue patients in Bangladesh. Authors wanted to highlight the clinical features, and hematological and biochemical profiles of dengue patients diagnosed in Bogra district, a non-endemic zone situated in northern Bangladesh. The authors reported that fever, headache, and myalgia were the commonest presenting complaints of dengue patients whereas vomiting and abdominal pain was the most prevalent warning signs. Severe dengue was associated mostly with plasma leakage rather than hemorrhage and the rise of hematocrit during hospital stay was a predictor of severe dengue. These findings will guide physicians for prompt therapeutic management of dengue infection in the study area.
