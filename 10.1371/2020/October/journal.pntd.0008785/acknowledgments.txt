The authors wish to thank the pig farmers for their participation and cooperation. We are also grateful to Prof. Marshall W. Lightowlers of the University of Melbourne for training the carcase dissection team and to Dr. Chiara Trevisan of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) Antwerp, and Mr. Gryson Mutabazi of TALIRI–Uyole for supervising the post–mortem examinations. We also thank Ms. Lizzie Chessang of GALVmed for data curation. Last but not least, the work of all members of the carcase dissection and field intervention teams is very much appreciated.
