Emerging infectious diseases involve complex systems on which background information is often lacking. Mathematical modelling, by providing a dynamic analysis of interactions between populations, can help our understanding of a disease transmission and maintenance, allowing for the simulation and comparison of intervention strategies aimed at controlling disease spread. We applied mathematical modelling to baylisascariasis, a disease caused by accidental ingestion of Baylisascaris procyonis eggs by humans, with consequences including fatal or severe neurologic disease. B. procyonis is an intestinal roundworm of raccoons, which shed eggs in the environment with their faeces. We modelled this system to simulate three different ways to reduce egg contamination and exposure risk for humans: raccoon depopulation, anthelmintic treatment of raccoons and faeces removal. Our models revealed that raccoon depopulation is the most efficient strategy to eliminate B. procyonis eggs, providing specific information on the minimum effort required to achieve their elimination, and showing that mathematical modelling is an efficient tool to identify the best strategy to control a disease beforehand, without wasting time and resources.
