Zoonotic pathogens, which are transmitted from their animal, arthropod or insect host to humans, have been responsible for some of the most devastating disease outbreaks in human history, including the largest Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa in 2014–2016, which resulted in over 28,000 infected persons and caused 11,310 deaths. Changes in land use practices, the climate and overall globalization concurrently brings human populations into closer contact with animals, arthropods, insects and the zoonotic pathogens they host, whilst increasing the possibility for local outbreaks to expand and spread internationally. Here we developed a multiplex serological assay that can be used to simultaneously detect IgG antibodies to 5 highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, Ebola -, Marburg -, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever—, Dobrava-Belgrade- and Rift Valley fever virus. Our assay was designed to be able to detect antibodies to multiple species of viruses within each family, and was adapted to detect animal (specifically bat) as well as human antibodies. This assay could be used as a serological surveillance tool to monitor evidence of infection with several highly pathogenic viruses in human and wildlife populations, which is important for risk assessment and prevention of zoonotic human infectious disease outbreaks.
