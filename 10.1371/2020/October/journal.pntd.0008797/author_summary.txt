Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are able to undergo genetic exchange during their growth. The previous description of hybrids in Peru and the recent discovery of unexpected genetically complex strains having characteristics of both hybrid and mito-nuclear discordance in its neighbouring country (Ecuador) with a similar eco-epidemiological situation led us to consider that the genetic structure of Leishmania strains in Peru is more complicated than previously thought. In an effort to revise the data on Leishmania strain dispersion in Peru and to search for evidence of genetic recombination, the present study was conducted. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis targeting the mannose phosphate isomerase (mpi) gene sequence was performed to identify the infecting parasite at the species level in 134 skin samples collected from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Peru, and the results were compared with those of cytochrome b (cyt b) gene sequencing obtained in previous studies. Most results (121/134) including 4 hybrids between L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (V.) peruviana showed agreement between PCR-RFLP of the mpi gene and cyt b gene sequence analysis; however, 13 of 134 samples revealed the distribution of strains with hybrids and mito-nuclear discordance. The results demonstrate that genetically complex Leishmania strains are present in Peru. These findings indicate that Leishmania strain dispersion in Peru is genetically more complex than previously considered. Further prospective studies including larger samples and the isolation of parasite strains are required to update the available data.
