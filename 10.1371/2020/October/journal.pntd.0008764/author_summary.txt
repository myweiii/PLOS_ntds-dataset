Schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic helminths including Schistosoma mansoni (SM), affects hundreds of millions of people globally. SM undergoes a complex life cycle within humans resulting in adult worm pairs that release eggs into the circulatory system. The human immune response to SM, especially to adult worms, is not well characterized. In addition, the impact of co-infections, which are common in SM endemic regions, on the immune response to SM is unknown. In this study, we first sought to characterize the T cell response to different stages of the SM life cycle. We next evaluated whether T cell responses to SM were altered in the setting of co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. We determined that human T cell responses to SM adult worm antigen are more robust than to SM egg antigen. This response is dominated by a non-classical T cell subset of γδ T cells producing IFNγ and TNFα. Lastly, we found that the ability of γδ T cells to proliferate in response to SM worm was lower in individuals with tuberculosis compared to naïve controls. This study provides novel insights into the immune response to SM and how tuberculosis may impair SM immunity.
