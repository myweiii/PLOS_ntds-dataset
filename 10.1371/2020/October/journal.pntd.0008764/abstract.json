    "Abstract": "Schistosoma mansoni (SM) is a parasitic helminth that infects over 200 million people and causes severe morbidity. It undergoes a multi-stage life cycle in human hosts and as such stimulates a stage-specific immune response. The human T cell response to SM is complex and varies throughout the life cycle of SM. Relative to the wealth of information regarding the immune response to SM eggs, little is known about the immune response to the adult worm. In addition, while a great deal of research has uncovered mechanisms by which co-infection with helminths modulates immunity to other pathogens, there is a paucity of data on the effect of pathogens on immunity to helminths. As such, we sought to characterize the breadth of the T cell response to SM and determine whether co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) modifies SM-specific T cell responses in a cohort of HIV-uninfected adults in Kisumu, Kenya. SM-infected individuals were categorized into three groups by Mtb infection status: active TB (TB), Interferon-\u03b3 Release Assay positive (IGRA+), and Interferon-\u03b3 Release Assay negative (IGRA-). U.S. adults that were seronegative for SM antibodies served as na\u00efve controls. We utilized flow cytometry to characterize the T cell repertoire to SM egg and worm antigens. We found that T cells had significantly higher proliferation and cytokine production in response to worm antigen than to egg antigen. The T cell response to SM was dominated by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that produced TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we found that in individuals infected with Mtb, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells proliferated less in response to SM worm antigens and had higher IL-4 production compared to na\u00efve controls. Together these data demonstrate that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells respond robustly to SM worm antigens and that Mtb infection modifies the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell response to SM."
