The disease lymphatic filariasis is caused by parasitic worms that are spread by mosquito vectors, and is endemic across much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, South and Central America, with over 893 million people in 49 countries considered to be at-risk. In 1997 the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis was established by the WHO with the aim of eliminating the disease as a public health problem by 2020 and supplies recommended guidelines for national programs to implement. The recommended control strategy is to annually administer deworming drugs to the population at-risk until stopping criteria based on disease prevalence are met, after which the disease prevalence is periodically measured to determine if transmission is ongoing. In our study, we simulate the disease transmission in a synthetic population, both during a mass drug administration program and after it is stopped, to statistically evaluate the effectiveness of the current guidelines. We focus on the ability of prevalence measurement post-MDA cessation to predict bounce-back or elimination by estimating the predictive value of antigenemia and filaremia surveys.
