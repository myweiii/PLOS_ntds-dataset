Anthrax is an expanding zoonotic and tropical disease which negatively impacts livestock, wildlife and human health ultimately impacting livelihoods and biodiversity conservation. In this work we have shown it to be a serious disease in Zimbabwe where its surveillance and control are sub-optimum even though it is causing serious losses in animals and human health. Observed practices such as the non-burial of infected carcasses subsequently contaminating the environment following anthrax outbreaks in animals, have most likely contributed to its expansion in geographic range and the increase in frequency of outbreaks. Since the late 1970s, the disease status has changed from that causing a low-level mortality in livestock, probably due to underreporting, to a common disease in livestock, wildlife and humans. It is hoped that by quantifying the impact of the disease across livestock, wildlife and human health and livelihoods, and establishing factors responsible for its continued expansion, adequate resources for surveillance and containment of anthrax will be allocated in order to improve rural livelihoods and also enhance wildlife conservation.
