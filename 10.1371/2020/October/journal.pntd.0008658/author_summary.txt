Brazil faced the most massive sylvatic yellow fever (YF) outbreak in 2016â€“2019. The outbreak affected highly densely populated areas, and Minas Gerais was the most affected state with thousands of deaths of human and non-human primates (NHP). We investigated the yellow fever virus (YFV) RNA in NHP carcasses collected throughout Minas Gerais in 2017 and 2018. We demonstrated the wide occurrence of YFV-infected NHP, including the viral persistence during the non-epidemic dry season of 2017. YFV RNA was detected in NHP carcasses in the urban, urban-rural interface and rural areas. We have also detected new YF cases in 49 municipalities where YF cases have not been previously detected during the outbreaks. Estimates of YFV genomic load in naturally infected NHP carcasses showed high and similar loads in specimens (Alouatta, Callithrix, and Callicebus) collected in rural areas and lower genomic loads in the urban-rural interface and urban Callithrix specimens. The presence of YFV inside urban areas poses an imminent risk, although no human case was epidemiologically linked to urban/Aedes transmission during the last outbreaks in Brazil.
