Non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes generally cause diarrhea in people. However, there are certain factors that make people at risk of developing a more severe infection where the bacteria can enter the blood and cause fever and whole-body symptoms. Patients with this infection are usually hospitalized, and about one in five patients do not survive. The factors that make this bloodstream infection possible include pathogen features like resistance to antibiotics and patient factors like a malnourished state. Better treatments are needed. In this study, the authors assess vitamin A as a treatment during antibiotic treatment failure in a mouse model. Vitamin A-deficient male mice have better outcomes with vitamin A and antibiotic co-therapy, whereas female mice do not benefit. Despite similar levels of bacteria causing infection systemically, female mice show better outcomes in terms of weight loss and survival than male mice overall. This research provides evidence that a clinical study assessing vitamin A as a treatment in people could lead to improved survival for malnourished patients presenting with severe bloodstream infection.
