Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease which has received priority attention in the global health space with WHO setting a target to decrease death and disability due to snakebite to 50% by 2030. High quality systematic reviews can inform policy and practice. We searched 13 electronic databases and PROSPERO, screened reference lists, and contacted experts. We identified 13 completed systematic reviews which has reviewed effectiveness and safety for first-aid, snake anti-venoms, drugs to prevent adverse reactions and fasciotomy. Evidence for interventions often came from few studies. We judged confidence on the results of the systematic reviews using AMSTAR-2 and all except one review was judged to have critically low confidence. Evidence with respect to specific geographic settings and for many specific anti-venoms is unavailable at the synthesis level and at the primary study level. Evidence related to late adverse reactions, wound-related outcomes, quality of life, duration of hospitalisation, cost, and disability is scarcely reported. Funding evidence gap maps, systematic reviews and development of core-outcome sets based on the results of this overview and subsequent conduct of randomised controlled trials for snakebite envenomation is essential.
