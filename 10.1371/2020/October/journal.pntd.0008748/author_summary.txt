Leishmaniases are vector-borne tropical diseases caused by more than twenty species belonging to the protozoan genus Leishmania and transmitted to humans and some other mammalian species by the bites of female phlebotomine sand flies. In the Palestinian Authority, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common leishmaniasis. This study investigated the Palestinian sand fly fauna, their infection rates and feeding preference determined by applying a kDNA-PCR and an ITS1-PCR. Twenty phlebotomine species were shown to be circulating in the study area. The most abundant species was Ph. papatasi (33.7%), followed by Ph. sergenti (21%). Infection by parasites of L. tropica was confirmed in 6.4%, using an ITS1-PCR. Meals of human blood were the most abundant (78.1%) and those of hyrax blood were identified in the cases of six sand flies, five Ph. sergenti and one Ph. papatasi
