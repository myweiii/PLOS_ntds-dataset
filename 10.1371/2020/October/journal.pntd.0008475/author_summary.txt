After Algeria and Morocco, the mosquito Aedes albopictus was detected in 2018 in Tunisia. This invasive species has continued its global expansion and then, extended the fear of introducing Aedes-transmitted arboviral diseases in countries where people are immunologically na√Øve. We demonstrated, using experimental infections, that Ae. albopictus mosquitoes from Tunisia were more competent to chikungunya virus than to Zika virus and dengue virus. These results are critical to design a control strategy targeting Ae. albopictus populations in regions hosting travelers returning from arboviral-endemic regions.
