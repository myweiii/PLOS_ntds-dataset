Intestinal worms are one of the most common infections in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. The roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides is the most prevalent and efforts are ongoing to use preventive chemotherapy to reduce both prevalence and intensity of this infection. To monitor these programs, stool-based microscopy is currently used. We have investigated the possibility of using ABA-1, an abundantly secreted protein from the worm, as a biomarker in stool of infected individuals. We have developed an ELISA and using this assay determined that ABA-1 as stool biomarker had a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 95.3% to detect infection with A. lumbricoides. We also showed that ABA-1 in stool rapidly and strongly decreased upon administration of a standard anthelminthic treatment. The main asset of this novel stool biomarker is its potential to be used in point-of-care immunoassay-based tests to determine A. lumbricoides infection in stool at the sample collection site.
