Ebola is a rare but deadly virus, found mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. People can get it through direct contact with an infected animal (bat or nonhuman primate) or a sick or dead person infected with Ebola virus. The virus can cause a host of different symptoms that overlap with many other diseases, making diagnosis a challenge for doctors, particularly with a lack of available rapid diagnostic tests or laboratory facilities.
This meta-analysis of predictive symptoms for Ebola virus shows that patients initially presenting with symptoms usually found late in illness, including confusion, conjunctivitis, dysphagia and jaundice were significantly more likely to end up with a diagnosis of Ebola. Early symptoms (typically not thought to be specific to Ebola), including diarrhoea, fatigue, vomiting, fever, muscle pain and cough were also found to be more predictive of a diagnosis of Ebola virus.
The existing literature fails to provide a unified position on the symptoms most predictive of Ebola. Confirmation of our findings will aid effective future clinical assessment, risk stratification tools and emergency epidemic response planning.
