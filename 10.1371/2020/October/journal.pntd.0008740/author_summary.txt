Podoconiosis is a foot disease that progressively affects genetically susceptible people who do not wear shoes in volcanic soil. This disease causes disability, stigma, and impinges on peopleâ€™s economic productivity. In Rwanda, it is estimated that 6429 people live with podoconiosis, but health services for these particular patients are almost nonexistent. We evaluated knowledge, attitudes and practice among 298 health professionals and 38 environmental officers and found that only 44% of all respondents knew that soil is the only direct cause of podoconiosis. Few health professionals (6%) reported having treated a podoconiosis patient and most health professionals (79%) identified shortages of critical drugs and supplies as an important barrier to providing treatment. Three quarters of environmental officers (74%) did not know that farmers are the people most vulnerable to this condition. The poor knowledge of all respondents toward podoconiosis and the lack of medical supplies suggest that podoconiosis patients likely receive substandard medical care and receive little credible information on prevention. We recommend a multi-sectoral approach to training, as well as the engagement of governments and the World Health Organization, to avail medications and treatment materials in the community.
