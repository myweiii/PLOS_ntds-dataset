Significant healthcare burdens arise from dengue and traditional vector control is the primary control strategy to reduce dengue transmission potential. The ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic has resulted in dramatic reductions in human mobility due to social distancing measures; the effects on vector-borne illnesses are not known. This paper examines the pre and post differences of dengue case counts in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, and estimate the effects of social distancing as a treatment effect whilst accounting for temporal confounders. We found that social distancing is expected to lead to an increase in the number of cases in Thailand, with the largest increase arising from Bangkok province. Social distancing policy estimates for Thailand were also found to be robust in sensitivity analysis. Conversely, no significant impact on dengue transmission was found in Singapore or Malaysia. Across country disparities in social distancing policy effects on reported dengue cases are reasoned to be driven by differences in workplace-residence structure, with an increase in transmission risk of arboviruses from social distancing primarily through heightened exposure to vectors in elevated time spent at residences, demonstrating the need to understand the effects of location on dengue transmission risk under novel population mixing conditions such as those under social distancing policies.
