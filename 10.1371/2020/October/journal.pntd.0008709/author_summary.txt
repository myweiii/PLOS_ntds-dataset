The human pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans causes a necrotizing skin disease known as Buruli ulcer. The major toxin of the mycobacteria, mycolactone, prevents the transport of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum, and thereby triggers a deadly stress response. We conducted the first haploid genetic screen to identify host factors with impact on mycolactone toxicity. This enabled us to identify the histone methyltransferase SETD1B as a novel mediator of mycolactone-induced cell death. RNA analyses of wild-type cells and resistant SETD1B knockout cells treated with mycolactone then showed a selective induction of genes implicated in programmed cell-death only in wild-type cells. This was accompanied by a marked reduction of the antioxidant glutathione, which might cause the mycolactone induced cell death.
