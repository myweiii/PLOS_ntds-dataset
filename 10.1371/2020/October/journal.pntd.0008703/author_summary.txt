Dengue fever is a globally expanding arboviral disease, consisting of four distinct serotypes, transmitted primarily by synanthropic/peridomestic mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Given the absence of specific treatment, and the incomplete protection provided by the currently available vaccine, vector surveillance and control remain the principal tool to prevent and control dengue transmission. However, vector surveillance through the monitoring of larval mosquito indices lacks consistency in addressing dengue risk. Surveillance based on pupal and adult stages is considered as more accurate to estimate dengue transmission risk, although monitoring is difficult to implement in routine. An alternative strategy is the use of the specific human antibody response to Aedes saliva to identify human exposure risk to Aedes bites. We conducted a hospital-based, case-control study in northeastern Thailand in order to identify risk factors for dengue infection using entomological and immunological indices, together with select individual and household characteristics. We found that people aged 10–25 years had significant higher odds of dengue than older adults (>25 years old). The presence of DENV-infected Aedes in the house was associated with 4.2-fold higher odds of dengue infection. Interestingly, Aedes adult abundance in the household was negatively associated with dengue revealing the complex role of Aedes density to dengue risk. This study highlights the potential benefit of monitoring dengue viruses in Aedes vectors to identify areas (“hot spots”) and people (“hot pops”) at higher risk of transmission.
