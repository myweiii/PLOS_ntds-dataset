Sugar feeding on plant nectar and other sources is an important mosquito behavior that varies between mosquito types. It is critical to understand sugar feeding because it impacts other aspects of mosquito biology, such as egg production, survival, and energy for activities such as mating and host seeking. Sugar can also be used to trap and kill mosquitoes. For example, attractive toxic sugar baits have been tested as a new control technique that depends on sugar feeding behavior for success. We investigated this behavior for the Asian tiger mosquito, a globally invasive species that can transmit several pathogens. We know very little about its sugar feeding behaviorâ€“only 4 studies have been conducted on the topic prior to ours, and none in Northeastern US, where our study was conducted. We found that hot and dry weather leads the mosquito to sugar feed more often and the presence of flowers increases the amount of sugar contained in those mosquitoes. Unexpectedly, we observed that host-seeking mosquitoes were more likely to be sugar fed than resting mosquitoes, which is contrary to previous studies showing a reduction in blood feeding after sugar feeding. In order to fully understand the patterns that we observed, further research will be necessary.
