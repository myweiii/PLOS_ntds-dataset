ZIKV and USUV are emerging flaviviruses that cause conditions ranging from mild febrile diseases to more sever outcomes. ZIKV is associated with microcephaly in newborns and USUV neurotropism represents a growing concern for human health. We studied these viruses in the context of breast-feeding. Breast-milk is a complex biofluid to nourish infants, support their growth and to protect them from numerous diseases, but it also represents a transmission route of several infections. It has been reported that flaviviruses can occasionally be detected in breast-milk, with limited information existing about their possible transmission through breast-feeding. We therefore explored the intrinsic protective role of human milk against ZIKV and USUV infections in vitro and we also assessed the contribution of specific components in mediating this activity. We demonstrated that human milk is endowed with anti-ZIKV and anti-USUV activity at all maturation stages and that it acts by altering virus attachment to the host cell. This activity is mostly due to non-specific bioactive factors, including extracellular vesicles and glycosaminoglycans. Our findings support the use of fresh milk (or from donor banks) as the food of choice for nutrition and protection of newborns in a possible context of ZIKV or USUV epidemics.
