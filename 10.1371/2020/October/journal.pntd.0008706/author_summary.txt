Mosquito immune responses work on an on/off switch model, where the recognition of microorganisms turns the switch on, and its clearance turns it off. Besides pathogen derived molecules, no other compounds are known to directly regulate the activation and the amplitude of immune responses. Here we described that prostaglandins, lipid mediators of the immunity in vertebrates, also modulate the amplitude of immune responses in mosquitoes as well. Prostaglandins regulate the production of antimicrobial peptides and other effector molecules and directly impact the susceptibility of mosquitoes to bacterial and viral infections. When prostaglandin production is impaired, immune activation is inefficient and renders the mosquito more susceptible to bacterial and Dengue infections.
