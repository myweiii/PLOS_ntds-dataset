Exosomes represent an important way of cell-cell communication. Their release into the bloodstream is similar to sending messages in a bottle that can safely reach target tissues and cells. In disease contexts, these vesicles provide a suitable source of markers of pathogenesis or carcinogenesis, as well as of the immune response and the host-pathogen interplay. In cystic echinococcosis (CE), the availability of a marker-based blood test would represent an extraordinary improvement for disease diagnosis, staging and follow-up. The active search for CE carriers, realized by ultrasound surveys of around 25,000 individuals in the HERACLES project, allowed the implementation of a proteomic biomarker discovery analysis based on plasma exosomes from CE patients. The identification of parasite proteins likely within host exosomes supports the occurrence of this important exchange of information through exosomes and suggests possible molecular markers to be further validated. Finally, our study provides complementary and supporting information to previous evidence on the types of response mounted by the immune system in the presence of active or inactive CE, exploiting data obtained in vivo, from a large, well-characterized cohort of subjects.
