Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging mosquito-borne virus that causes severe neuroinvasive disease in humans. USUV was first detected in Africa in 1959, and cases of human disease have increased in recent years. Most USUV disease cases are now reported in Europe, where the virus currently circulating. One possibility for the increase in case numbers is that USUV strains have become more pathogenic over time during its spread from Africa into Europe. We compared the pathogenesis of five USUV isolates from Africa and Europe in a mouse model. Three isolates from Africa and one isolate from Europe caused 100% mortality in mice. Surprisingly, one isolate from Netherlands caused only 12% motality. Significantly less histopathology was observed in tissues from mice inoculated with the Netherlands strain compared to mice inoculated with the other four strains. Our results suggest that, even though more human USUV disease cases have been reported in Europe recently, African USUV strains are also highly pathogenic.
