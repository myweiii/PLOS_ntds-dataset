Mycetoma is a chronic human infection, recently listed as a neglected tropical disease. Its diagnosis, treatment and prevention are complicated. In theory, infectious disease produced by bacteria or fungi may be preventable through vaccination; however, there is no available vaccine for this and other infections. This chronic infection usually affects the lower extremities and produce severe inflammation with deformities and disability. Current medical treatment is expensive and requires months or years to complete, and surgical intervention including amputation is frequent. Microbes that produce mycetoma live in soil, and enter the skin by accidental traumatic inoculation with spines. There is an urgent need to generate scientific information to identify possible therapeutic targets and vaccine development for treatment or prevention. An actinomycetoma model was created using mice under experimental conditions, to understand how these microbes produces damage and to comprehend the host response to clear the infection. In this work, aminoguanidine was given to experimental mice and it was found that this treatment, completely prevented inflammation and the mycetoma lesion. This information will be useful for the design of treatments that target not only the offending microbe but also to modulate the host immune response.
