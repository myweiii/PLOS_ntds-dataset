HTLV-1 is a life-long persistent infection with no curative treatment available. It can cause a disabling neurological disease (HAM/TSP). Public policies targetting HTLV-1 prevention are important. Cost-utility studies are essential to identify which policies should be implemented. These studies have been hampered by the lack of information about health state utility values in patients with HAM/TSP and asymptomatic carriers (AC). These values represent the quality of life (QoL) and may vary from 0 (death) to 1 (best health state). We determined these values for AC (0.7121) and HAM/TSP patients (0.2991) using a self-administered questionnaire in patients from Brazil and UK. QoL in patients with HAM/TSP is lower than that reported for more than 130 other conditions with such data, including multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, Parkinsonâ€™s disease and HIV infection. For 12% of patients with HAM/TSP QoL was worse than death. Disease severity, rather than duration of disease, is associated with decreased QoL in HAM/TSP. HTLV-1 AC have impaired QoL compared to the general population in both countries. The data presented here will inform proper economic analysis in order to identify cost-effective policies. This is especially important for low- and middle-income countries where HTLV-1 prevalence is high and resources are limited.
