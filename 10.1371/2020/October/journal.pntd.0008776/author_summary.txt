Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses a serious threat worldwide because of its associated serious neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome in adults and microcephaly in newborns. Vertical transmission of ZIKV in humans has been confirmed. Furthermore, there have been reports of ZIKV infection in field-collected eggs, larvae and adult mosquitoes, which implies that ZIKV can also be vertically transmitted in mosquito vectors. However, the characteristics of vertical transmission of ZIKV in Aedes albopictus remain unclear. Here, we infected mosquitoes by allowing them to feed on an infectious blood meal. F1 progeny (eggs and adults) from mosquitoes with ZIKV-positive ovaries were studied. Our results demonstrate that ZIKV can be vertically transmitted in Ae. albopictus via transovarial transmission. The female mosquitoes infected via the congenital route can horizontally transmit ZIKV to suckling mice through bloodsucking. These updated findings can be used for ZIKV disease prevention and vector control strategies.
