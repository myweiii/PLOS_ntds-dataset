Rabies is a nearly 100% fatal disease in humans. However, available vaccines are effective in preventing rabies infection. To investigate if a person is protected against rabies, rabies virus neutralizing antibody levels in the blood are determined. The World Health Organization defines protective immunity as a rabies virus antibody concentration of at least 0.5 IU/ml detected in serum using a virus neutralization test. Yet, in remote areas serum may be rather difficult to collect, process and transport. Whole blood collected with a finger prick and applied on filter paper cards, also known as dried blood spots (DBS), are an easier alternative. This collection method is frequently used for serology of several tropical infectious diseases, but never studied for rabies serology in humans. Therefore, we compared antibody levels measured in serum with those measured in DBS eluates, using the gold standard FAVNt and related it to another commonly used test for human rabies serology, the Platelia-II ELISA. We found that both assays had a good performance on DBS eluates. The reported high specificities provide confidence that unprotected individuals will rarely be missed. Therefore, the DBS is a promising sampling technique for evaluations of vaccination strategies and monitoring persisting immunity after vaccination in populations at risk for rabies.
