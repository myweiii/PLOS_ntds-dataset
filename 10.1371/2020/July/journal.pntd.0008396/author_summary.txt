Kinetoplastid parasites of the genus Leishmania are responsible for a diverse spectrum of mammalian infectious diseases, the leishmaniases, including cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and mucosal pathologies. Infectious metacyclic promastigotes of infected female Phlebotomus sandflies are injected into the host at the site of the bite during the sandfly blood meal, after which they are internalized by host professional phagocytic neutrophils and macrophages. Leishmania infantum is an etiological agent of potentially fatal visceral pathology. This study molecularly dissects the maturation of L. infantum-containing phagosomes/parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in host macrophages. We reveal the requirement of vacuolar movement along macrophage microtubule tracks for the phagosome trafficking toward the endolysosomal pathway necessary for the development of the mature tight-fitting PV crucial for L. infantum survival and proliferation.
