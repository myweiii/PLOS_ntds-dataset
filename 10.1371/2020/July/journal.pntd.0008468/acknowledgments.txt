We are very grateful for having had the opportunity to learn from the insights and tremendous expertise of Professor Farrokh Modabber while discussing this work. We would also like to thank the organizers and attendees of the VL vaccine expert meeting in Rockville, USA, in September 2015 at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, where the idea for this study sparked.
