Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major neglected disease, potentially fatal, caused mainly by Leishmania infantum and L. donovani. Its control is still impaired by inefficient and/or expensive treatment and diagnostic methods. VL diagnosis is mostly dependent on serological assays made with bacterially expressed Leishmania proteins. Tests developed for the human form of the disease, however, are not efficient for its diagnosis in the canine host. Dogs are the major reservoir for the American VL and their infection also needs to be monitored, requiring a distinct diagnostic test. Here, we describe a new chimeric protein potentially able to be used for both human and canine VL diagnosis. Based on a systematic approach using three Leishmania proteins known to be efficient for the diagnosis of either human or canine VL, fragments of each were joined in various combinations. The diagnostic potential of different chimeric proteins was then evaluated with human and canine sera from VL afflicted individuals. The best protein showed high levels of sensitivity in humans and dogs with no relevant false positive results with healthy controls or humans with tegumentary leishmaniasis. It is then potentially useful for the detection of both humans and dogs afflicted with VL in novel diagnostic tests.
