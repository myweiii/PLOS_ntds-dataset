Eumycetoma is a neglected fungal disease endemic in Africa, India, and Latin America. Black-grain eumycetoma is the most common type in Africa and is mainly caused by Madurella spp. The Sudan, and in particular Gezira State, central Sudan is hyperendemic for black-grain eumycetoma. Patients with this type of mycetoma are treated with surgery in combination with antifungal therapy. In this study, we collected surgical biopsies from patients attending Gezira Mycetoma Center to directly identify the etiology of black-grain eumycetoma in this state. We also studied the epidemiology of the disease based on the demography of the patientsâ€™ population. Our result showed that the highest endemic regions were Southern Gezira (76.6%) and Northern Sinnar (23.4%). By applying direct PCR and sequencing we confirmed that the most common etiology of the disease is Madurella mycetomatis (88.2%). In addition, we found one case of M. fahalii and the first Sudanese case of M. tropicana and Sphaerulina rhododendricola.
