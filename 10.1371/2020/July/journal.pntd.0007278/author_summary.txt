Dengue fever is a viral infection transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes causing a flu-like illness that may develop into severe complications such as dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome if the patient contracts two viral serotypes concurrently. Three dengue serotypes have been detected in Dar es Salaam (DNV 1, 2 and 3). There is currently no antiviral treatment or vaccine available against dengue so vector control and mosquito bite prevention remain essential to prevent transmission. Due to globalisation and rapid urban expansion, Dar es Salaam is experiencing regular dengue outbreaks. Without adequate vector control and public awareness, these will certainly continue to re-occur. During the dengue outbreak of 2014 we followed up 97 people with confirmed dengue. We went to their homes to ask them about their perception of dengue and to look at the suitability of their homes for vector breeding.
We devised a tool to predict whether Aedes aegypti would be present in breeding sites based on the results of other authors in the region. The study proposes the use of HSS, a tool to be used to predict the productivity of Aedes breeding habitats, which correctly predicted the presence of Aedes aegypti 75% of the time. The prediction will enable quick management of habitats before the rain begins.
The study interviewed those who had confirmed dengue and identified a large gap in public knowledge of dengue fever: 84% of people interviewed thought bed nets can prevent dengue, 60% of the patients only became aware of dengue while in the hospital with the illness and 22% thought that dengue spreads from person to person. The public need to be aware of dengue prevention and management especially just before the rains. Most respondents owned mobile phones and the use of mobile phone messages might be a suitable means to raise awareness before possible outbreaks.
