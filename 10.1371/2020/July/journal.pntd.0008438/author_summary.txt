What if Zika virus (ZIKV) had been introduced in Australia from 1996–2015 in urban centres with established mosquito vectors? Would Australian blood transfusion safety be compromised due to risks associated with ZIKV? In the event of ZIKV introduction into Australia during the period 1996–2015, our estimation shows that local transmission arising from an imported case, would have been possible in most of the selected urban centres, albeit very low. However, ZIKV transmission remained a potential threat in Cairns, Rockhampton, and Thursday Island during the warmest months. Potential geographic range expansion of both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti is a key threat to the Australian mainland. We found that sexual transmission would have an important role in the estimation of R0 if only the Ae. albopictus population were present and not Ae. aegypti. Had both vectors been established in Australia during the period investigated and a ZIKV introduction occurred, the associated risk to blood transfusion safety would have been low. We identified regions of Australia where ZIKV transmission presents a potential, however low, concern for blood supply safety. Our study informs decision making on blood transfusion safety, public health and mosquito control policies.
