This study describes the development of a set of interchangeable diagnostic assays for the detection of Ebola virus in patient samples. Each are rapid-turnaround, highly-specific (showing no detection of non-Ebola strains), sensitive and portable. These assays are ideally placed for field-use during outbreaks in low-resource countries and equally suited to use as conventional high-throughput laboratory tests. They encompass a colourimetric option with easy-to-interpret pink-to-yellow colour-change visualisation and real-time detection formats allowing the approximation of virus copy number, which helps monitoring of virus levels during infection. The inclusion of a probe-based detection method also leaves the door open for multi-pathogen detection, which could be useful for future VHF outbreaks, where the cause is unknown.
