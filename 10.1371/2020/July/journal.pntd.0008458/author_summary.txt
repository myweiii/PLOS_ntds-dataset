Understanding mechanisms that make cells sensitive to xenobiotics (including drugs) is of great importance to both drug development and public health. For the latter, emergence of resistance is particularly important to monitor as well as to predict. Trypanosomes are a major global health burden and for several drugs resistance has emerged and is a considerable concern. Here we have examined the sensitivity to pentamidine, which is mainly mediated by an aquaglyceroporin, a surface channel. We find that the protein is highly sensitive to mutation, rendering the protein unstable, and rendering parasites resistant to pentamidine. As this also includes mutant forms recovered from patients where pentamidine treatment has failed, we suggest that the instability of aquaglyceroporin is an important contributor towards treatment failure.
