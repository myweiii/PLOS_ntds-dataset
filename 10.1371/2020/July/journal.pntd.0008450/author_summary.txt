Zika is a serious threat to global health since the outbreak in Brazil in 2015. Zika virus (ZIKV) is generally considered as an Aedes-transmitted pathogen. The transmission of ZIKV by mosquito bite has been recognized as the major transmission route. However, it is possible that some important potential vectors may not yet have been examined. Armigeres subalbatus is one of primary mosquito species in China, which could develop in human waste lagoons. In the study, through oral infection experiments, it was found that Ar. subalbatus could be infected with ZIKV and transmit ZIKV through mosquito bites. Therefore, in many rural areas in China and in undeveloped areas of other Asian countries, it is valid to consider that this mosquito species should be given enough attention in the prevention and control of Zika epidemic.
