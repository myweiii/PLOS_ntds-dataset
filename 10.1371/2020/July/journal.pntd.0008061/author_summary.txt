Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), Rift Valley (RVFV) viruses and other viruses constitute an important group of etiologies of fever in Tanzania. In the past decade, Tanzania has experienced DENV and RVFV outbreaks at different times. While RVFV outbreaks have occurred cyclically in approximately ten-year periods in Tanzania, DENV outbreaks have been more frequent since 2010. CHIKV infection is an important but largely unrecognized illness in Tanzania. In this study, we aimed to generate baseline data on the exposure and infection status of DENV, RVFV and CHIKV by detecting antibodies to the viruses and detecting the viruses in human subjects in two geo-ecologically distinct sites. Neither infection nor exposure to the viruses was in observed in Magugu site in Manyara region, northern Tanzania. There was a significant exposure to RVFV (16.39%) and CHIKV (9.83%) in Wami-Dakawa but not to DENV in either site. None of the viruses was detected by PCR in any of the sites. Potential risks for exposure to CHIKV and RVFV were larger numbers of household members, having no formal education and having recently travelled to an urban destination. Since arboviral outbreaks are usually unpredictable, it is crucial to undertake active surveillance for RVFV, DENV, CHIKV and other viral agents in Tanzania.
