Nodding syndrome (NS) is a devastating and mysterious neurological disorder affecting 5–15 years old children, primarily in Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania. NS strongly associates with an infection with the parasitic worm Oncocherca Volvulus (Ov), transmitted by the black fly, affecting many people worldwide. Moreover, NS is most probably an 'Autoimmune Epilepsy', especially in view of our recent findings that NS patient’s autoimmune GluR3B antibodies induce ROS and kill both neural cells and T cells. NS patient’s IgG also induce seizures, multiple brain damage and inflammation-inducing cells in the brain. HLA class I genes are expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells and present peptides to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. HLA class II genes are expressed mainly on the surface of antigen presenting cells and present peptides to helper CD4+ T cells. Analysis of HLA of South-Sudanese NS patients and healthy controls revealed that that few amino acids in HLA peptide-binding grooves associate with either protection or susceptibility to NS. Theses amino acids could be critical in NS by affecting beneficial immunity and/or detrimental autoimmunity.
