    "Abstract": "Nodding syndrome (NS) is a devastating and enigmatic childhood epilepsy. NS is accompanied by multiple neurological impairments and neuroinflammation, and associated with the parasite Onchocerca volvulus (Ov) and other environmental factors. Moreover, NS seems to be an \u2018Autoimmune Epilepsy\u2019 since: 1. ~50% of NS patients have neurotoxic cross-reactive Ov/Leimodin-I autoimmune antibodies. 2. Our recently published findings: Most (~86%) of NS patients have glutamate-receptor AMPA-GluR3B peptide autoimmune antibodies that bind, induce Reactive Oxygen Species, and kill both neural cells and T cells. Furthermore, NS patient\u2019s IgG induce seizures, brain multiple damage alike occurring in brains of NS patients, and elevation of T cells and activated microglia and astrocytes, in brains of normal mice. Human Leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II molecules are critical for initiating effective beneficial immunity against foreign microorganisms and contributing to proper brain function, but also predispose to detrimental autoimmunity against self-peptides. We analyzed seven HLA loci, either by next-generation-sequencing or Sequence-Specific-Oligonucleotide-Probe, in 48 NS patients and 51 healthy controls from South Sudan. We discovered that NS associates significantly with both protective HLA haplotype: HLA-B*42:01, C*17:01, DRB1*03:02, DQB1*04:02 and DQA1*04:01, and susceptible motif: Ala24, Glu63 and Phe67, in the HLA-B peptide-binding groove. These amino acids create a hydrophobic and sterically closed peptide-binding HLA pocket, favoring proline residue. Our findings suggest that immunogenetic fingerprints in HLA peptide-binding grooves tentatively associate with protection or susceptibility to NS. Accordingly, different HLA molecules may explain why under similar environmental factors, only some children, within the same families, tribes and districts, develop NS, while others do not."
