Plasmodium vivax is the most abundant Plasmodium species in Brazil. While this species has been neglected for many years, the recent emergence of drug-resistant strains and the absence of a vaccine intensified the efforts for a better control method. Naturally acquired immune response analysis is a useful tool for understanding the antigenicity of Plasmodium proteins and evaluating the potential of a vaccine candidate. In this study, the genetic variability of one of the leading P. vivax vaccine candidates (PvAMA1) was analyzed. Two distinct variants were expressed and the antibody response was evaluated in infected and noninfected individuals in the Brazilian Amazon. This improved understanding of the magnitude and dynamics of the antibody response will contribute to the knowledge of a vaccine candidate and open new perspectives in vivax malaria vaccine development.
