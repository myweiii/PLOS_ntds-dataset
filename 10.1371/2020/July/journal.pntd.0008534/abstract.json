    "Abstract": "Mast cells are innate effector cells that due to their localization in the tissue form the first line of defense against parasites. We have previously shown that specifically mucosal mast cells were essential for the termination of the intestinal Strongyloides ratti infection. Here, we analyze the impact of mast cells on the immune response and defense against the tissue-dwelling filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis using mast cell-deficient Cpa3cre mice. Despite an increase and an activation of mast cells at the site of infection in wildtype BALB/c mice the outcome of L. sigmodontis infection was not changed in mast cell-deficient BALB/c Cpa3cre mice. In Cpa3cre mice neither vascular permeability induced by blood-sucking mites nor the migration of L3 was altered compared to Cpa3 wildtype littermates. Worm burden in the thoracic cavity was alike in the presence and absence of mast cells during the entire course of infection. Although microfilaremiae in the peripheral blood increased in mast cell-deficient mice at some time points, the infection was cleared with comparable kinetics in the presence and absence of mast cells. Moreover, mast cell deficiency had no impact on the cytokine and antibody response to L. sigmodontis. In summary, our findings suggest that mast cells are not mandatory for the initiation of an appropriate immune response and host defense during L. sigmodontis infection in mice."
