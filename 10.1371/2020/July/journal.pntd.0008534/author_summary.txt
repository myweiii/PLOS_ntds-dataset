Mast cells are innate cells that are equipped with biologically potent granule proteins. Due to their localization in many tissues they form the first line of defense against parasites such as helminths. In the current study we analyzed the impact of mast cell deficiency on the course of a tissue-dwelling helminth infection. Mice were infected with the filarial nematode L. sigmodontis in the presence and absence of mast cells. We show that mast cell numbers increase at the site of infection and that mast cells are activated. Despite the recruitment of mast cells in infected wildtype BALB/c mice, worm burden in the thoracic cavity and final eradication of microfilariae from the peripheral blood were alike in mast cell-deficient and wildtype mice. Mast cell deficiency had no impact on the anti-helminth immune response. In summary, our findings suggest that mast cells are not required for a protective immune response against L. sigmodontis infection in mice.
