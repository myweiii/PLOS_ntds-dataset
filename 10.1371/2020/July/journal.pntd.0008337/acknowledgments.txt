We would like to thank the enthusiastic and tireless efforts of the BILHIV field workers Ethel Mwansa, Mwiingana Lukonga, Ruth Mwanza, Mervis Kantukaleza, and Judith Lungu. Our work would not have been possible without practical support from Clement Mwakamui, George Chaila, and Hilary Sipulila (Zambart). We are extremely grateful for laboratory support from Barry Kosloff, Maina Cheeba and Friday Mbesa (Zambart). We gratefully acknowledge Eric A.T. Brienen (LUMC) for performing the genital PCR analysis and Claudia J. de Dood (LUMC) and Pytsje T. Hoekstra (LUMC) for performing the CAA analysis. We thank the ODK forum for assistance with questionnaire construction and Chrissy Roberts (LSHTM) for his invaluable support with 3D printing, ODK, and other essentials.
