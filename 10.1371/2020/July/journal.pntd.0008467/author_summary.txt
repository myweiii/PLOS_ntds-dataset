Debilitating articular pain frequently occurs as a consequence of Chikungunya virus infection, affecting individuals' quality of life for a long time. Here we present a simple tool to predict people at risk to remain with long-term articular pain after Chikungunya infection. We evaluated 134 patients acutely affected by Chikungunya virus searching for characteristics previously described as related to persistent symptoms. We examined about 80% of those individuals after one year to identify those with persistent arthralgia. We detected five features that represent good predictors and developed a scoring system named SHERA (www.sheracalculator.com/shera), the acronyms of Sex (female), Hypertension, Edema, Retroocular pain and Age (>26y). SHERA can correctly predict 8 out of every 10 Chikungunya infected individuals that will persist with articular pain symptoms at least one year after disease onset. These results were confirmed in the second group of patients from another city affected by Chikungunya outbreak.
The easy-to-use scoring system can be applied in areas with limited access to health support, helping to identify the ones who will need special care and benefit from early intervention.
