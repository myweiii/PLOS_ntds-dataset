STH infection (infection by A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworms) are endemic in Colombia; however, its prevalence in the country has not been described within the last 30 years. This study determines the prevalence and intensity of STH infections, nutritional status, and anemia in children, using multistage stratified probability sampling. The prevalence result of all STH at national level was 29.6%. T. trichiura was the most prevalent (18.4%), followed by A. lumbricoides (11.3%), and hookworms (6.4%). Comparing the biogeographic provinces (eco-epidemiological zones), Amazon√≠a had the highest STH prevalence. A large spatial variation was found in STH prevalence by province. The study shows that STH infection remains a national public health problem, which requires intervention through nationwide strategies using a comprehensive inter-programmatic approach and prioritizing high-risk areas. These strategies should aim at improving the living conditions associated with the infection while being supported by large-scale anthelmintic chemotherapy.
