Schistosomiasis is a serious and often fatal disease that is caused by infection with parasitic worms of the Schistosoma species. It affects several hundreds of millions of people world-wide, mostly in the tropics, through contact of skin with infected water, usually lakes and rivers. Only one drug, praziquantel, exists for its treatment, so resistance to it would leave the disease untreatable and new drugs are urgently needed. Here, we report on a strategy to develop new anti-schistosomal agents by inhibiting the regulatory systems of the worm. Cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP are key regulators of cellular activity, and their activity is determined by enzymes called phosphodiesterases or PDEs, that can degrade them. We identified and cloned the genes coding for ten of these PDEs from Schistosoma mansoni, a species causing a very high disease burden. By expressing these genes in specialized cell lines of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, under conditions where growth becomes conditional on the expression of the introduced Schistosoma PDE, we show that most of these genes indeed code for functional PDEs. For several PDEs we also determined, using a third expression system, the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, whether they regulate cAMP or cGMP. We also identify a number of inhibitors for one of these PDEs and show that all are expressed more in male than in female worms. This work is essential to map and characterise the regulatory pathways of schistosomes and will facilitate the development of inhibitors of the key enzymes.
