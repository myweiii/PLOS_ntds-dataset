    "Abstract": "Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is a highly prevalent infection world-wide, that was previously considered mild, but complications such as anemia have been highly reported in the past years. In mice models of malaria, anti-phosphatidylserine (anti-PS) autoantibodies, produced by atypical B-cells, bind to uninfected erythrocytes and contribute to anemia. In human patients with P. falciparum malaria, the levels of anti-PS, atypical B-cells and anemia are strongly correlated to each other. In this study, we focused on assessing the relationship between autoantibodies, different B-cell populations and hemoglobin levels in two different cohorts of P. vivax patients from Colombia, South America. In a first longitudinal cohort, our results show a strong inverse correlation between different IgG autoantibodies tested (anti-PS, anti-DNA and anti-erythrocyte) and atypical memory B-cells (atMBCs) with hemoglobin in both P. vivax and P. falciparum patients over time. In a second cross-sectional cohort, we observed a stronger relation between hemoglobin levels, atMBCs and autoantibodies in complicated P. vivax patients compared to uncomplicated ones. Altogether, these data constitute the first evidence of autoimmunity associating with anemia and complicated P. vivax infections, suggesting a role for its etiology through the expansion of autoantibody-secreting atMBCs."
