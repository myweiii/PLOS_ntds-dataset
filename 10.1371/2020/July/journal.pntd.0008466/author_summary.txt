Malaria is one of the top global infections causing high mortality and morbidity every year. Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malarial infection, particularly in the region of the Americas. Complications associated with P. vivax, such as anemia, are a growing reported phenomenon, but the mechanisms leading to them are poorly understood. Here, we report the first evidence of autoantibodies and Atypical Memory B-cells correlating with anemia in two different cohorts of P. vivax patients, particularly during complicated infections. These findings point to Atypical Memory B-cells as key pathological players, possibly through the secretion of autoantibodies, and attributes a role for autoimmunity in mediating complications during P. vivax infections.
