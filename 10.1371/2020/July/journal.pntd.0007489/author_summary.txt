Phlebotomus papatasi sand flies vector Leishmania major parasites, one of the causative agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Approximately 0.7â€“1.2 million cases of CL occur each year. CL produces disfiguring skin lesions for which no vaccine currently exists. Hematophagous arthropods secrete salivary proteins that modulate host inflammation, vasoconstriction, and blood clotting. Salivary proteins from multiple phlebotomine sand fly species have been widely studied and scrutinized to characterize their function in blood feeding as well as their ability to exacerbate or attenuate Leishmania infections. Hence their potential role as vaccine or as a component of vaccination strategies. In such regard, we hypothesize that in order to be successful, sand fly salivary protein-based vaccines must consider, in addition to the human immune responses, the genetic variability and the expression profiles of such salivary antigens from geographically distant sand fly populations. The purpose of this study was to analyze the genetic variability of nine of the most abundant secreted salivary proteins identified in P. papatasi, comparing insects collected from distinct ecotopes in Egypt and Jordan.
