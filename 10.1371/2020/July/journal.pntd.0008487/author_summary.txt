Chagas' disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a chronic debilitating infection occurring mostly in Latin America. There is an urgent need for new, well tolerated drugs. However, the latest therapeutic candidates have yielded disappointing outcomes in clinical trials, despite promising preclinical results. This demands new and more predictive in vitro assays. To address this, we have developed an assay design that enables the growth of T. cruzi intracellular forms to be monitored in real time, under drug pressure, for 6 days post-infection. This allowed us to establish the tipping point of drug action, when the death rate of the parasites exceeded the growth rate. The resulting pharmacodynamics profiles can provide robust and informative details on anti-chagasic candidates, as demonstrated for the benchmark drugs benznidazole and posaconazole.
