Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is an important cause of central nervous system (CNS) infections in Asia and is considered endemic in Indonesia. However, reports of JEV infection in non-encephalitic disease cases are lacking because diagnosis is difficult to confirm and JEV is rarely considered as a cause of non-encephalitic disease. Here, with robust serological testing, we identified cases of JEV infection in patients presenting at a regency hospital in Bali with fever but without symptoms of CNS infection. This finding supports the need to include JEV in routine clinical diagnostic algorithms for patients with fever in endemic areas.
