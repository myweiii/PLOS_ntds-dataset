Endothelial cell activation is a key process in the pathogenesis of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Platelets are classically involved in endothelial cell activation in several diseases, but their role in the context of vivax malaria remains unclear. Thrombocytopenia is the most common hematological disturbance in P. vivax-infected patients, and platelets have been implicated in parasitemia control. In this work, we studied the activation of platelets in association with endothelial cell activation in vivax malaria. Platelets retrieved from infected peripheral blood were non-activated when analyzed by flow cytometry; however, they displayed higher mean volume and significantly reduced counts. We also found higher levels of circulating factors associated with platelet activation (especially soluble CD40L), thrombopoiesis and endothelial cell activation in infected patients. Further, through pair-wise correlation and clustering analysis, we found a subgroup of patients showing significant associations between markers of platelet and endothelial activation in a pattern different from that of endemic controls. Collectively, our findings indicate a role of platelets in endothelial cell activation in vivax malaria and indicate a heterogeneous host response in the setting of uncomplicated disease, a finding to be further explored in future studies.
