New classes of environmentally-safe pesticides are vitally needed to address established and emerging mosquito-borne infectious diseases. In this investigation, we describe characterization of an interfering RNA pesticide corresponding to the mosquito Shaker gene. Although the pesticide recognizes a conserved target site in the Shaker genes of multiple species of disease vector mosquitoes, it lacks a known target site in humans or other non-target organisms. The pesticide killed adult mosquitoes when it was microinjected or provided to adults as an attractive toxic sugar bait. The pesticide also induced high mortality rates when fed to larvae using a yeast-based expression and delivery system. These studies demonstrated that interfering RNA pesticides targeting the mosquito Shaker gene could one day be used for the biorational control of mosquitoes and the prevention of multiple mosquito-borne illnesses.
