Plasmodium vivax, a malaria parasite that can stay dormant in the liver and originate relapses within months after a single mosquito inoculation, causes 76% of the malaria burden in Latin America. Pregnant women are ineligible for primaquine (PQ), the only currently available drug that is able to prevent P. vivax relapses. Here we apply a mathematical model to real-life data from Brazilâ€™s main malaria transmission hotspot and estimate that, once infected with P. vivax, 23% of the pregnant women will have one or more vivax malaria recurrences over the next 12 weeks. Significantly, 86% of these early P. vivax recurrences are attributable to relapses or late recrudescences, which could be prevented by PQ administration. Repeated vivax malaria infections during pregnancy are associated with adverse effects on maternal and neonatal health. We show that weekly CQ chemoprophylaxis extending over 4 to 12 weeks, starting after the first vivax malaria episode diagnosed in pregnancy, might reduce the risk of P. vivax recurrences over the next 12 months by 20% to 65%, and should be investigated as a measure to lower the burden of repeated vivax malaria during pregnancy.
