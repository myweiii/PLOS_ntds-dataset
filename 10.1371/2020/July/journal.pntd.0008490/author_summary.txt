The recent outbreaks of chikungunya, Zika and dengue viruses in the Caribbean and Latin America during 2013â€“2018, have motivated local health authorities in individual countries to seek international assistance from multiple agencies and adjust their vector management strategies in order to contain the transmission of Aedes-borne diseases. Countries within the region rely mainly on the use of commercially available insecticides to manage the mosquito populations and by extension, reduce the transmission of vector-borne diseases. However, this practice is stymied by the ability of these insects to develop resistance mechanisms to insecticides of frequent use. Many countries in the Caribbean and Latin America regions lack the facilities and supplies to conduct routine insecticide susceptibility testing. In an effort to ascertain knowledge on the presence of insecticide resistance in Aedes aegypti populations, and to determine which insecticide is more effective to reduce vector populations of Jamaica, we conducted an array of bioassays with three different types of insecticides (pyrethroid, organophosphate, carbamate) to use local evidence and inform public health authorities on vector control status and alternatives.
