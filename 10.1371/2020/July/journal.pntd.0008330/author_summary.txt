Sporotrichosis is a subacute or chronic infection characterized by nodular lesions of the (sub)cutaneous tissues and adjacent lymphatics. Sporothrix brasiliensis, S. schenckii, and S. globosa are the main agents of sporotrichosis in humans and other mammals. Sporothrix propagules gain entrance by traumatic implantation in the skin following two main routes of infection, which include animal transmission (e.g., cat-cat and cat-human) and plant origin. In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of atypical and more severe cases of sporotrichosis, along with the expansion of the area of occurrence of Sporothrix species, such as the highly virulent S. brasiliensis. We investigated the usefulness of the AFLP technology, a DNA fingerprinting technique, which is based on the selective amplification of genomic restriction fragments by PCR to explore genetic diversity and population structure in Sporothrix during ongoing outbreaks. We report six highly effective sets of AFLP markers to discriminate Sporothrix at species and strain level, thus allowing tracking the spread of sporotrichosis. Adding molecular data in an outbreak response context can reveal better ways to improve public policies to contain the advance of sporotrichosis, by early detection, response, intervention, and follow-up.
