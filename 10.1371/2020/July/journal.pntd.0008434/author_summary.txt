Meteorological conditions are the most frequently mentioned factors in the study of dengue fever. Some of the main factors other than the purely meteorological about which the public-health authorities might have data, such as numbers of cases or other current measurements of dengue outbreaks in neighboring cities, had been used in some of the past dengue studies. In this study, we developed models for predicting dengue case number based on past dengue case data and meteorological data. The goal of the models is to provide early warning of the occurrence of dengue fever to assist public health agencies in preparing an epidemic response plan.
