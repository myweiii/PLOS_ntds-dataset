Mycobacterium leprae, the obligate human pathogen is uncultivable in axenic growth medium, and this hinders research on this pathogen, and the pathogenesis of leprosy. The development of novel therapeutics relies on the understanding of growth, survival and metabolism of this bacterium in the host, the knowledge of which is currently very limited. Here we reconstructed a metabolic network of M. leprae- GSMN-ML, a powerful in silico tool to study growth and metabolism of the leprosy bacillus. We demonstrate the application of GSMN-ML to identify the metabolic pathways, and metabolite classes that M. leprae utilizes during intracellular growth.
