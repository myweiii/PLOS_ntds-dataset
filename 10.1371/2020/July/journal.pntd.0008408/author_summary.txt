Understanding the factors that influence the spread and population growth of Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses, will aid vector control and public health agencies to identify the communities most at risk for Ae. aegypti biting. This study found associations between increased Ae. aegypti abundance and mappable socioeconomic variables that can serve as a basis for targeted control strategies. We describe neighborhood- and household-scale risk factors associated with increased Ae. aegypti abundance in Los Angeles, California, an area that historically has had a relatively high number of travelers return home that are infected with Zika and dengue viruses. Our results show that Ae. aegypti is more abundant in lower income communities in Los Angeles and that several household, behavioral, and socio-demographic characteristics are associated with increased abundance of Ae. aegypti. Our findings have the potential to help vector control agencies identify communities at risk of increased household Ae. aegypti abundance and develop community-specific interventions to minimize household infestations.
