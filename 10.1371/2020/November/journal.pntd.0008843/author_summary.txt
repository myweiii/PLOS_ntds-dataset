Identifying dengue cases early is crucial but challenging for healthcare professionals. This challenge is increased during large epidemics and is a particular problem in non-endemic areas with limited experienced staff. To improve dengue diagnosis, we investigated how to exploit machine learning (ML)-based prediction models and identified four key variables [age, fever, white blood cell counts (WBCs), and platelet counts], which are compatible with clinical and epidemiological knowledge. With these variables, the ML prediction models [decision tree (DT), deep neural network (DNN)] and the logistic regression model developed for identifying laboratory-confirmed dengue cases produced areas under curve (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves ranging from 83.75% to 85.87%. This implies that the prediction models may serve as a pivotal component of an integrated dengue surveillance system and they required only a single complete blood count (CBC) examination. The sensitivities, positive prediction values, and accuracies for major risk factors in the two machine learning models were close to those of the regression models. For future applications, the DNN models with superior performance can be employed at epidemic sites with adequate computer facilities, while the DT and regression models with interpretable prediction logic can be employed at sites with limited or no computer facilities. Artificial intelligence and clinical parameters identified from this study may aid when laboratories are overwhelmed, but should never replace laboratory confirmation.
