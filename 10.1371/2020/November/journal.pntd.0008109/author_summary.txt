Snakebite envenoming is one of the most neglected tropical diseases considering its burden of mortality and morbidity. Antivenoms are the only known effective treatment for snake-bite envenoming but are frequently responsible for high rates of adverse reactions. Clinical development of antivenoms rarely follows the iterative phases of clinical development applied to other drugs. Dosing is typically based on pre-clinical testing. Here we propose a Bayesian model based adaptive design for phase 2 clinical trials aiming to determine the optimal dose of antivenom needed for treatment of snakebite envenoming. Optimality is defined using safety and efficacy thresholds contextual to the study. This design can be applied to all antivenoms which have binary efficacy and toxicity endpoints. Our design formally specifies a desired efficacy and a maximum tolerated toxicity. We use simulation studies to characterise adequate sample sizes to determine an approximately optimal dose under different scenarios. The simulation studies highlight the advantages of a model based design over simpler rule based alternatives. This design will be used to determine an effective and safe dose of the new lyophilised viper antivenom currently in use to treat Russellâ€™s viper envenoming in Myanmar.
