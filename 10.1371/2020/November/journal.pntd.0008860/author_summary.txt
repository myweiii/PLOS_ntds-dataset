Female Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes blood-feed preferentially on birds but also on mammals including humans, to which they may transmit pathogenic arboviruses. To prevent transmission of West Nile and/or other viruses in Harris County, TX, the vector control agency applies mosquito adulticides when arboviruses are detected. Insecticide resistance can hinder mosquito control, increasing the risk of disease transmission. Pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes carry kdr-like mutation(s) in the sodium channel, the pyrethroid target site in the nervous system, that increases survival probability. We investigated frequency and spatial distribution of the kdr-like mutation in Harris County mosquitoes, and how they affect pyrethroid survivorship. We conducted field cage tests with a commercial pyrethroid formulation, and developed molecular tests to detect the kdr-like mutation in females from 6 operational areas. In field tests, almost no mosquito survived at 30.4 m, but 14% and 35% of mosquitoes survived at 60.8 m and 91.2 m. We found 99% of mosquitoes carried at least one kdr-like allele. At the high rate of pyrethroid, the survival probability of mosquitoes carrying one or two kdr-like alleles was not statistically different in the six areas, but survival increased significantly with distance. These results should be considered when analyzing risk of disease transmission.
