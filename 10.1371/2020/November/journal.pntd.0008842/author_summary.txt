Author summary
Trichinellosis, also known as trichinosis, is a disease caused by consuming raw or undercooked meat from animals infected with muscle stage larvae of Trichinella spiralis. These worms cause infection when L1 (newborn) larvae migrate and invade skeletal muscle remodeling muscle cells into long-lived nurse cells which serve as reservoirs for the parasite. The establishment of nurse cells allows T. spiralis to better survive within the host because factors, such as blood vessel formation, bring required components for survival to the worms. We previously found three novel proteins termed Secreted from Muscle stage Larvae (SML)-1, -2, and -3 by transcriptomic analysis. In this study, we further expand our previous findings by identifying two novel low molecular weight proteins SML-4 and SML-5, which can elicit protective responses against challenge infections with T. spiralis.
