Scrub typhus, a life-threatening vector borne rickettsial infection accounts for a million cases annually. While the disease was initially described predominantly in Asia, Northern Australia and islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans (known as the tsutsugamushi triangle), scrub typhus has now been reported in areas considered previously free of disease like Africa and South America. International travel also accounts for the microbial trafficking of this disease and its presentation to non-endemic areas. The diagnosis of scrub typhus is challenging due to its non-specific symptoms and the lack of sufficient data on the performance of various diagnostic tests. Several tests have been developed for the diagnosis of scrub typhus over the last few decades. However, there exists ambiguity on which tests are most suitable in a given clinical scenario and the apt timing to perform these tests. This study provides further insight into the performance of various serological and molecular tests in the diagnosis of scrub typhus, assists in understanding their discriminatory potential and diagnostic accuracies enabling prompt treatment of the disease.
