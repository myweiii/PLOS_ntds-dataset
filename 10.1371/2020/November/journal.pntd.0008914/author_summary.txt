Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease which is closely associated with underdevelopment. Poor accessibility to safe and effective antivenoms is a major issue in some regions highest-affected by snakebites. Antivenom can prevent severe effects of envenoming if given early. Therefore, educating communities and health care workers to improve treatment seeking after snakebite is a global priority. Many factors are associated with delayed presentation to hospital and early administration of antivenom. We found that most snakebite patients in Sri Lanka present to the first hospital within an hour of the bite. However, there remains a delay of about two more hours until the first dose of antivenom is administered. This delay is a reflection of a delay in the appearance of observable or measurable features of envenoming and a lack of reliable early diagnostic tests. We emphasise the need for reliable, rapid diagnostics for systemic envenoming.
