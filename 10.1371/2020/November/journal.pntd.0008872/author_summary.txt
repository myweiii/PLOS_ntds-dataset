The Democratic Republic of Congo announced its tenth outbreak of the Ebola virus disease on 1st August 2018. As part of the preparedness measures to prevent and rapidly contain any importation of the virus, South Sudan, a neighbouring country to the Democratic Republic of Congo implemented a surveillance system which included an Ebola alert management system. We analyzed the performance of this system with a view to provide information to inform planning and allocation of resources to the other components of Ebola virus disease preparedness and to understand the key issues and challenges with the system. Our findings show that more than half of the reported alerts did not meet the case definition of the disease, alerts were mainly detected in the high-risk states, the commonest source of alert detection were from health facilities and the community and the most common symptoms presented by the alerts were fever, bleeding, headache, vomiting and weakness/fatigue. This study demonstrates that the Ebola virus disease alert management system in South Sudan was fully functional despite the associated challenges and provided evidence to further improve Ebola preparedness in the country. We recommend that the observed challenges should be urgently addressed.
