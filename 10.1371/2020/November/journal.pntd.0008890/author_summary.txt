Extracellular RNAs (ex-RNAs) are secreted by cells through association with proteins or extracellular vesicles (EV). In the context of parasitism, ex-RNAs represent novel communication intermediaries with promising potential as biomarkers. In order to better understand the role ex-RNAs may play in the context of the zoonotic disease echinococcosis, we have characterised the RNA profile secreted by the larval stage (metacestode) of Echinococcus multilocularis.
By analysing the products secreted towards the extra- and intra-parasite milieus, we demonstrate that the metacestode displays a polarized secretion of different classes of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). In addition, we show that EV secretion occurs mainly towards the inner fluid of the metacestodes. Interestingly, we confirm the presence of host sRNAs in the intra-parasite milieu, implying their internalization and transport through the tegument. Finally, the detection of Echinococcus miRNAs in patient samples yielded negative results suggesting the tested miRNAs may not be good biomarkers for this disease.
In summary, our results provide a detailed description of the ex-RNA landscape of the E. multilocularis metacestode together with information on the distribution of the detected RNA classes in different extracellular compartments. This information is of importance to better understand host-parasite interaction and also, to improve current diagnostic tools.
