The contribution of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti to the spread of dengue fever depends not only on their abundance, but also on the likelihood of an exposed mosquito living long enough to incubate the dengue virus and subsequently transmit it to a susceptible human host. We developed a mechanistic model that accounts for the role of this process in the dynamics of dengue fever and fit the model to a time series of human case reports and mosquito trap counts from the city of Vit√≥ria, Brazil. We then used this fitted model to simulate the effect of mosquito control implemented at different times of the year and found that mosquito control leads to the largest reduction in human dengue cases over the following year when implemented in early September, during the dengue off-season. Further, the effectiveness of mosquito control was strongly negatively correlated with the overall average abundance of mosquitoes. Together with the timing of effective control, these results suggest that mosquito control is most effective when mosquitoes are already limiting to transmission.
