In this qualitative study, we conducted focus group discussions with men and women residing in communities participating in a cluster-randomized trial of community-wide deworming for soil-transmitted helminth (STH) in order to understand how knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes are influenced by gender. Men and women shared similar beliefs and attitudes, although there were differences in knowledge about STH infection and its treatment. While both genders understood that STH transmission is associated with poor sanitation and hygiene, women voiced a greater appreciation of these risk factors, perhaps because of the STH knowledge gained from the frontline health workers during school MDA and anaemia programs. Men and women both believed that adults may be re-infecting children in the community and both articulated acceptance of deworming medications. However, both men and women also noted that stigma associated with an adult having STH infection prevented them from actively seeking treatment. The cMDA for STH, may provide important socio-behavioural benefits to communities, as it provides an opportunity to treat all community members over one year of age without discrimination by infection status or age. However, compliance with treatment may be affected by community beliefs; women expressed concerns regarding treatment safety while men specifically expressed concerns about achieving treatment coverage due to the absence of some individuals during cMDA due to migration and people being absent for work. Findings from this study suggest that communication and dissemination messages should include a rationale for cMDA and stress the safety and benefits of the drug. In addition, these results highlight the importance of carefully timing the delivery of cMDA to ensure that working adults and migratory populations have access.
