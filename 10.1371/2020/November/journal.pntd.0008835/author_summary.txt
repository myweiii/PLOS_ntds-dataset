A model system resembling normal human liver cells is needed for advancement of hepatotropic infectious disease research. Here we show that immortalized cells (imHC) derived from human stem cells have a higher efficiency of DENV replication and a lower rate of cell death in response to DENV infection than the cancer cell-derived model systems currently used. The imHC also have active fat metabolism and respond well to anti-viral drug treatment, making them an attractive model for the initial stage of drug discovery and testing.
