The global incidence of DENV infection has evidenced a dramatic increase in the recent two decades with a great number of cases that are misclassified or underreported. These epidemiological characteristics generate high economic costs, especially in endemic regions and countries such as Saudi Arabia. This two-phase study aimed at providing economic data that helps political efficiency and resource prioritization for dengue prevention programs, by assessing the economic burden of disease over the last five years 2013â€“2017. A double-method used to estimate direct costs due to care expenses and indirect costs due to productivity loss, by using a predictive and an economic model, respectively. Assuming an expansion factor of 3 to correct under-reporting, the average estimated costs of dengue illness per year in the current study was US$117.87 million. Comparison of these findings with international reports emphasized the substantial disease burden of dengue fever in Saudi Arabia. Despite some limitations, this study provided the first economic data of dengue fever infection burden in Saudi Arabia.
