Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected parasitic zoonosis. Its diagnosis and follow-up require evaluation with imaging. Currently available serological tests are applied to confirm the diagnosis in doubtful cases, although having limitations in diagnostic accuracy, and they are not useful for patientsâ€™ follow-up. Seroassays for CE are usually based on hydatid fluid (HF) obtained from infected animals, with consequent problems of heterogeneity and low specificity. The use of semi-purified HF derivatives or recombinant antigens has been attempted to improve these aspects, but with an unacceptable loss in sensitivity. Most newly developed antigens have been tested on a limited number of samples, not always well characterized, and have been rarely compared using the same samples cohort. Here, we tested and compared three recombinant antigens (2B2t, GST-2B2t and GST-Ag5t), and a recombinant chimeric antigen (DIPOL) based on three highly immunogenic components of HF (B1, B2 and Ag5), in an attempt to increase the sensitivity of recombinant antigen-based seroassays for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with CE. We found that GST-2B2t had higher sensitivity than the other antigenic preparations, but still not as high as HF, and that GST-2B2t and GST-DIPOL had statistically higher specificity than any of the other tested antigens. GST-2B2t also showed potential for the follow-up of patients with CE after drug treatment.
