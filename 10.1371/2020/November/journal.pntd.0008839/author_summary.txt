The goal towards the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as indicated by Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) is to identify persons with morbidity such as lymphedema and hydrocele and manage their condition to make their lives better. Patients who experience acute attacks also need to be identified and given help or treatment. The number of lymphedema and hydrocele patients in lymphatic filariasis endemic communities are usually underreported. This consequently affects their management. Therefore, an innovative tool such as a mobile phone-based interactive voice response system (mIVRS) that can give accurate information on morbidity cases in real time and also reduce the underreporting of cases is needed. In this study, more morbidity cases and more acute attacks were reported using mIVRS than with the traditional methods. If implemented, this innovative method of reporting cases and acute attacks may help programme managers to ensure that the patients are identified to receive care. It can also be extended to other infectious and non-infectious diseases.
