Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance, particularly in the tropics, including Thailand. The mortality rate could be as high as 40%. These patients often developed kidney failure, liver failure, or cardiopulmonary failure, and require a high level of care. Nevertheless, the mortality rate can be reduced to 5% if prompt intensive care is provided. Predicting those at risk of developing severe disease is challenging. However, biomarkers to predict severe leptospirosis are still lacking. Our data provided the first evidence that microtranscriptome profiles of severe leptospirosis were different from the non-severe group. This data provides the first evidence that the microtranscriptome profiles of patients with severe leptospirosis were different from the non-severe group. Serum miR155-5p and miR630 levels might be novel biomarkers for identifying severe leptospirosis.
