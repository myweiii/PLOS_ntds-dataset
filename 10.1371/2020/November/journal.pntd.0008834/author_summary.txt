Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is one of the most medically important tick-borne disease. CCHFV causes severe clinical signs in humans but not in its vertebrate animal hosts. Transmission of the virus to humans could be through the bite of infected ticks or by exposure to the tissues or blood of infected animals. Nosocomial infections have also been reported in endemic countries and are considered to be significant problems for health-care workers and family members. With the increasing number of the cases and expanding new foci of the CCHF endemic area, there is an urgent need to prioritize control strategies on the consideration of disease reduction. Recently, different approaches have been attempted towards the development of a CCHFV vaccine. We previously developed a cell culture based inactivated CCHFV vaccine that demonstrated protective efficacy in IFNAR-/- mice. To date, the only CCHFV vaccine tested in humans is the suckling mouse brain derived vaccine used only in Bulgaria. However, there are no experimental data to show whether this vaccine confers to protective efficacy in a mouse model. We have used the IS mouse model to explore the immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of the cell culture based and the mouse brain derived inactivated vaccines against CCHFV. Both vaccine preparations have provided complete protection after challenge studies but the cell culture based vaccine more effectively induced to CCFHV spesific antibody and T cell responses.
