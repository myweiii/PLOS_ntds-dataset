Snakebites affect people globally including Bhutan and snakes are source of fear and excitement. Major proportion (62.7%) of Bhutanese population who thrive on agro-farming, rearing livestock, and searching forest products are at risk of snake envenomations. Deaths due to snakebites are dependent upon use of first aid type, provisions available with the health facilities, and health seeking behaviors of snakebite victims. This multi-center study was conducted to assess the level of knowledge of health workers and its association with their demographic features and health seeking behavior of snakebite victims as observed by health workers using investigator administered structured questionnaire. We included 12 hospitals and a Basic Health Unit (BHU) from 10 snakebite prone Dzongkhags with 962 (84%) snakebites from January 2013 to December 2017 in the country. Among 118 health workers interviewed, 27 (23%) had adequate level of knowledge with remaining 91 (77%) having inadequate knowledge. Male health workers and Doctors had better level of knowledge than other study groups. Health workers from Sarpang scored higher compared to those from other Dzongkhags. A total of 42% (n = 50) health workers scored below 60% (31 or less correct responses for 52 questions), which demands requirement of training and inclusion of practice-oriented courses in training curriculum of health professionals for snakebite management. Often, use of traditional medication and less frequent adherence to WHO recommended first aid measures was observed by 5% (n = 6) respondents. The adoption of non-recommended treatment practices seems to delay proper treatment resulting in gangrene and associated complications.
