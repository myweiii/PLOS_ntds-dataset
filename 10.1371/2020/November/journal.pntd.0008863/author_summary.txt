Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne pathogen responsible for a severe acute fever disease in humans, requiring biosafety level 4 laboratory for handling. This is the reason why the molecular pathogenesis of CCHFV remains largely unknown. Hazara virus (HAZV), member of the same serogroup but nor responsible for human disease, is commonly used as surrogate model to study CCHFV in biosafety level 2 laboratory. As an important viral model, it is important to better understand its range of applicability. Using polarized Caco-2 cells, we showed HAZV doesnâ€™t have the same pattern of infection in fully polarized cells than CCHFV. These data were confirmed using compounds able to modulate cell junctions: compounds leaded to opposite effect on respective virus infection capacity. All data together suggest that CCHFV and HAZV receptors have different localization on polarized Caco-2 cells. Moreover, using supernatant of HAZV or CCHFV infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells, we demonstrated that only factors released from CCHFV-infected moDCs are able to enhance CCHFV infection. To our knowledge, this study is the first one showing differences in HAZV and CCHFV entry into polarized target cells and in CCHFV infection modulation by a paracrine effect linked to infected dendritic cells.
