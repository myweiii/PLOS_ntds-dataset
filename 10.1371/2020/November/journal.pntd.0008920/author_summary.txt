Mosquitoes transmit many pathogenic viruses, such as dengue virus, Zika virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, which are of great burden to public health worldwide, notably in the tropical regions. In addition, they also harbor a number of insect-specific viruses (ISVs), however, little is known about the role for the ISV in mosquito populations and their interaction with arboviruses. Yichang virus (YCV) is a newly identified member of the Mesoniviridae family discovered in Culex mosquitoes collected from Hubei, China. In this article, we investigate the transmission competence of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus for YCV, and its interaction with mosquito-borne flaviviruses in vitro. Our study shows, for the first time, that this virus could be horizontally and vertically transmitted, thus strongly inhibiting the replication of the pathogenic dengue virus serotype 2(DENV-2)in C6/36 cells, and reduced transmission of DENV-2 in Ae. albopictus. These data provide further insight on the transmission mechanism of ISVs and how they interact with flaviviruses.
