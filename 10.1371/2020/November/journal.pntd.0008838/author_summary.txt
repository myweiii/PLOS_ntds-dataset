The radical cure of vivax malaria requires killing the blood stages and the dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) of Plasmodium vivax. Primaquine (PQ) is currently the only widely available drug to kill hypnozoites, but its use is hampered by concerns over haemolysis in patients with Glucose-6-Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. At a recent round table discussion of the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN) policy makers prioritised further studies to determine the risk-benefit of PQ in different endemic settings.
We used a large dataset of more than 26,000 patient treated in a routine care setting in Papua, Indonesia over a 9-year period to explore the risk of adverse outcomes following PQ. Even though patients were treated with PQ without G6PD testing, those patients receiving PQ had a 20% lower risk of all cause re-presentation and 50% lower risk of hospitalization than those not treated with PQ. The risk of mortality was 20% lower, although this didnâ€™t reach statistical significance.
Great emphasis is placed on the risks of PQ induced haemolysis, inhibiting its widespread use. It is critical that these risks are interpreted in the context of the substantial benefits of reducing the recurrence of episodes of malaria and associated morbidity and mortality. Our analysis provides reassuring evidence that, in an area with a high burden of malaria and low G6PD prevalence the beneficial effects of PQ outweigh its risks.
