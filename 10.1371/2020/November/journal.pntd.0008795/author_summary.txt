Regional longitudinal strain is reduced in IFCD before significant fibrosis. As CD progresses to CF, global STE measurements of left ventricle (GLS, GCS, twist and torsion) and GLS of right ventricle are reduced.
Early abnormal strain pattern of CD comprises inferior, septoinferior and inferolateral segments of LV. Recognizing the regional strain pattern of Chagas cardiomyopathy may help identifying the disease even at early stages.
