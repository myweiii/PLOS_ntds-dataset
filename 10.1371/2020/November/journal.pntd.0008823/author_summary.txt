With early initiation of ART among HIV infected patients, mortality from CCM has significantly gone down. CCM however remains the second highest cause of mortality in HIV, the highest burden being in sub-Saharan Africa where 75% of all deaths occur. Most of the studies evaluating mortality have reported short-term mortality. We determined mortality and associated factors among patients treated for CCM using recommended therapy in the CryptoDex trial (ISRCTN59144167) in Uganda, and the effect of dexamethasone adjunctive therapy on mortality at two years. This was done by looking back at all 211 patients who had previously been enrolled into a trial of treatment for CCM (the CryptoDex trial, which recruited patients between April 2013 and February 2015) and determining their survival up to 2 years after they entered the study. This retrospective cohort study was done between May 2017 and July 2017. 127 (60%) of the patients had died by two years. Those with Glasgow coma score (GCS) below 15, those with lower weight, and those that had convulsions were more likely to die, while dexamethasone use and fungal burden did not affect mortality. Long-term mortality in CCM patients remains high even among patients receiving recommended therapy. Strategies to improve long-term survival in CCM patients are urgently needed, especially targeting those with reduced GCS, low weight, and convulsions.
