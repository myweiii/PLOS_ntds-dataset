Aedes aegypti is the only known vector for dengue virus (DENV) in New Caledonia (NC). DENV are divided into four serotypes (DENV-1 to -4), based on their antigenic properties, these being subdivided into different genotypes. All four DENV serotypes have regularly circulated in New Caledonia in the past. An unusual persistence of DENV-1 has been observed during the last ten years, suggesting a possible preferential transmission of this DENV serotype by Ae. aegypti. In this study, we examine for the first time the ability of Ae. aegypti from New Caledonia to transmit the four circulating DENV serotypes, and more precisely two genotypes of DENV-1. Our results demonstrate that this vector is moderately competent for DENV, with slight differences observed between DENV serotype/genotype in terms of transmission. These findings suggest that other factors are at play in the sustained circulation of DENV-1 and that further vector-virus interactions studies should be undertaken to better understand the DENV epidemiological profile in NC.
