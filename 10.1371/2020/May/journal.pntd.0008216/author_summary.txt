One of the pillars for the prevention of Aedes-transmitted arboviral infections has been vector control, which is primarily based on the use of chemical insecticides. However, extensive use of insecticides has led to the development of insecticide resistance, undermining the sustainability of control programs. Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene have been associated with knockdown resistance in many insect species including Aedes aegypti. In Africa, in spite of the use of insecticides for vector control in many countries, data on insecticide resistance and its underlying mechanisms remain scarce. In this study, we report for the first time the occurrence of a recently described kdr mutation, V410L, in Old World Ae. aegypti from Angola and Madeira island. Two other kdr mutations, V1016I and F1534C, were also identified in populations from Angola and Cape Verde, extending our knowledge about the distribution of these mutations in Africa. We found significant associations between kdr genotypes and the resistance phenotype but only in the Angolan population. These results suggest that populations carrying the same kdr mutations may respond differently to the same insecticide, stressing the need for complementary studies when assessing the impact of kdr resistance in the outcome of insecticide-based vector control.
