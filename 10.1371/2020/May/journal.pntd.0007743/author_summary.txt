The life cycle of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni is split between snail and mammalian (often human) hosts. An infection can last for more than 10 years, during which time the parasite physically interacts with its mammalian host as it moves through the bloodstream, travelling through the lungs and liver, to eventually establish a chronic infection in the blood vessels around the host gut. Throughout this complex journey, the parasite develops from a relatively simple larval form into a more complex, sexually reproducing adult. To understand the molecular basis of parasite interactions with the host during this complex journey we have produced genome-wide expression data from developing parasites. The parasites were collected from experimentally-infected mice over its developmental time-course from the poorly studied lung stage, to the fully mature egg-laying adult worm. The data highlight many genes involved in processes known to be associated with key stages of the infection. In addition, the gene expression data provide a unique view of interactions between the parasite and the immune system in the lung, including novel players in host-parasite interactions. A detailed understanding of these processes may provide new opportunities to design intervention strategies, particularly those focused on the early stages of the infection that are not targeted by current chemotherapy.
