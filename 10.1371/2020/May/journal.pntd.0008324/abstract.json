    "Abstract": "Local anomalies in rainfall and temperature induced by El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a episodes could change the structure of the vector community. We aimed to estimate the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013La Ni\u00f1a cycle in the potential distribution of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) vector species in Colombia and to compare the richness of the vectors with the occurrence of CL in the state of Norte de Santander. The potential distributions of four species were modeled using a MaxEnt algorithm for the following episodes: La Ni\u00f1a 2010\u20132011, Neutral 2012\u20132015 and El Ni\u00f1o 2015\u20132016. The relationship between the potential richness of the vectors and the occurrence of CL in Norte de Santander was evaluated with a log-binomial regression model. During the El Ni\u00f1o 2015\u20132016 episode, Lutzomyia ovallesi and Lutzomyia panamensis increased their distribution into environmentally suitable areas, and three vector species (Lutzomyia gomezi, Lutzomyia ovallesi and Lutzomyia panamensis) showed increases in the range of their altitudinal distribution. During the La Ni\u00f1a 2010\u20132011 episode, a reduction was observed in the area suitable for occupation by Lutzomyia gomezi and Lutzomyia spinicrassa. During the El Ni\u00f1o 2015\u20132016 episode, the occurrence of at least one CL case was related to a higher percentage of rural localities showing a richness of vectors = 4. The anomalies in rainfall and temperature induced by the episodes produced changes in the potential distribution of CL vectors in Colombia. In Norte de Santander, during Neutral 2012\u20132015 and El Ni\u00f1o 2015\u20132016 episodes, a higher probability of at least one CL case was related to a higher percentage of areas with a greater richness of vectors. The results help clarify the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013La Ni\u00f1a cycle in the dynamics of CL in Colombia and emphasize the need to monitor climate variability to improve the prediction of new cases."
