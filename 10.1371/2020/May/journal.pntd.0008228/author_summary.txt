Buruli ulcer caused by inoculated Mycobacterium ulcerans is a tropical infection fibrosing subcutaneous tissues thus causing severe disabilities. The reservoir and the mode of transmission of M. ulcerans remain elusive. Here, using molecular approaches, we traced M. ulcerans along an alimentary chain comprising some plants and a small herbivore named Thryonomys swinderianus (grasscutters), in Côte d’Ivoire. Grasscutters are hunted animals, sold as bush meat. People in Buruli ulcer endemic regions spend much time in close contacts with this animal during hunting and subsequent evisceration with unprotected hands increasing their risk of contamination. Our findings demonstrate for the first time, the transmission of M. ulcerans through a food-chain and propose prophylactic measures against Buruli ulcer in Côte d’Ivoire.
