The intestinal cells of parasitic nematodes are not known to regenerate, therefore disruption of essential processes that cause irreparable damage to intestinal cells is expected to promote worm expulsion. To facilitate improved methods of therapy we need to better understand the basic intestinal cell and tissue functions of this critical organ. To that end we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of multi-omics omics data and identify and prioritize intestinal genes/pathways with essential functions and associated drugs and established a foundational model of the STH intestinal system using the large roundworm Ascaris suum to test and validate inhibitors of these functions. We found 10 inhibitors that impacted motility, and seven of those showed severe pathology and an apparent irreparable damage to intestinal cells. Furthermore, five inhibitors were effective against the three phylogenetically diverse parasitic nematode species, indicating potential for broad spectrum anthelmintics. Our results firmly validate the focus on intestinal cell biology as a useful resource to develop novel anthelmintic strategies.
