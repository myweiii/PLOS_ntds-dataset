Chagas disease (ChD) is a neglected tropical disease, with the majority of the individuals affected living in Latin America. Functional limitation and poor perception of quality of life (QoL) may be identified. QoL indicators are important for planning and to improve patients care. However there is a gap in the literature regarding the evaluation of QoL in patients living with chronic CD, in remote regions assisted by primary health care in their territory of residence. A cross-sectional study was conducted using the baseline of a prospective cohort performed in remote towns in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Lower QoL scores were identified in the Environment domain followed by the Physical domain. Higher scores were found in the Social Relations domain. Low QoL scores have been associated with clinical aspects such as use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and history of acute myocardial infarction, and socio-demographic aspects such as increasing age. QoL is positively associated with medicine use of angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARA). The subjective perception of QoL was not associated with the severity of the disease using as a marker the presence of CCC in the evaluated population.
