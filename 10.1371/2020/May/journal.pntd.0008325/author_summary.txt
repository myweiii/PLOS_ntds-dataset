Leprosy is difficult to diagnose since it is caused by a bacterium that does not grow in vitro. Bacilli direct detection or the presence of specific antibodies can vary greatly depending on the clinical form. M. leprae direct DNA detection can aid clinical diagnosis, although invasive skin biopsies are still necessary to detect the pathogen or histological features consistent with leprosy. Here we show that a kit combining mechanical and chemical lysis efficiently removes host DNA and enriches for M. leprae DNA, allowing better detection of paucibacillary cases. We believe our findings can contribute to improving disease diagnosis, as well as early detection and that could help monitoring strategies.
