T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagasâ€™ disease, interacts with ECM in order to invade cells and establish the infection in the mammalian host. Studying this interaction, our group has recently described changes in the nitration profile of histones upon incubation of the parasite with ECM. Herein we used a proteomic approach to identify nitrated DNA binding proteins in T. cruzi. We also used ChIP-Seq to investigate whether the contact of the parasite with host ECM is capable of promoting changes in the DNA binding pattern of nitrated proteins. We observed significant alterations in the nitration levels and DNA binding profile of T. cruzi histones upon parasite incubation with ECM.
