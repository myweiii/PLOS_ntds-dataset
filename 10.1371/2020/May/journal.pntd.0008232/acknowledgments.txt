We thank the board of Miwatj Health Aboriginal Corporation, the clinic staff and community members for their encouragement and support. We also thank Steve White and Jenny Shield. Finally, we acknowledge our teacher, the late Emeritus Professor Rick Speare, who inspired us with the vision for a national strongyloidiasis control program to eliminate strongyloidiasis in remote Indigenous communities in Australia.
