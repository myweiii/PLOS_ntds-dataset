From our previous work in non-human primates and others using humans, we believe that previous DENV immunity confers some degree of protection against ZIKV infection. However, at least two highly relevant questions remain unanswered. One is precisely if the time between primary DENV and a subsequent ZIKV infections may play a role in the degree of protection conferred by DENV immunity. The second question is related to the mechanisms of cross-protection. In this work we provide evidences that a period of 12 months between DENV and ZIKV infections has a significant impact controlling ZIKV replication compared to a shorter period of 3 months. We also provide evidences that the pre-existing DENV Abs play no role controlling early ZIKV replication. Our results strongly suggest that the mechanisms controlling ZIKV replication are related to the complex interaction between the innate and the cellular immune responses. Our results have significant implications for vaccine design and schedules.
