Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne infection that causes significant disabling and disfiguring clinical conditions. Hydrocoele (scrotal swelling) is the most common condition affecting an estimated 25 million men worldwide. Surgery is the main intervention, however, there is limited information on its impact. This study assessed men before and after surgery in an endemic region of Malawi, to identify potential barriers and determine how surgery may change the quality of their life. Before surgery, 201 men reported to have moderate to severe problems with many aspects of their life including pain, mobility, usual activities, self-care, social issues, psychological health and ability to work. The main barrier to hydrocoele surgery was the cost, including associated transport and accommodation costs. After surgery, follow-up surveys at 3-months and 6- months found that men reported minimal or no physical, social, psychological problems and took no time off work. Surgery had a significant positive and lasting impact on menâ€™s lives. National programmes need to advocate for resources to increase funding to support men and the uptake and demand for quality surgical services.
