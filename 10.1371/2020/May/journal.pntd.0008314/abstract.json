    "Background": "Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne parasitic infection that causes significant disabling and disfiguring clinical manifestations. Hydrocoele (scrotal swelling) is the most common clinical condition, which affects an estimated 25 million men globally. The recommended strategy is surgical intervention, yet little is known about the impact of hydrocoele on men\u2019s lives, and how it may change if they have access to surgery.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "We prospectively recruited and followed-up men who underwent surgery for hydrocoele at six hospitals in an LF endemic area of Malawi in December 2015. Men were interviewed at hospitals pre-surgery and followed-up at 3-months and 6-months post-surgery. Data on demographic characteristics, clinical condition, barriers to surgery, post-surgery symptoms/complications and quality of life indicators were collected and analysed pre- and post-surgery, by age group and stage of disease (mild/moderate vs. severe), using chi-square tests and student\u2019s t test (paired).",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Surgery had a significant positive impact on many aspects of a patient\u2019s life, and the expansion of this treatment to all those affected in LF endemic areas would greatly improve the quality of men\u2019s and their families\u2019 lives, and greatly contribute to the global goal of providing universal health care."
