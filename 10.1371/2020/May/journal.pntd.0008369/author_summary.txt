Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic ulcerating tropical skin disease known to particularly affect vulnerable populations. Without early detection and effective treatment it can lead to disfigurement, disability and stigma. In order to improve outcomes, we need to understand what factors prevent patients from accessing and completing treatment, however these factors are often not well understood. Factors considered to potentially affect treatment completion include access to care and type of treatment. In this study we analysed data available from clinical records of patients treated in Ghana to identify whether type of treatment and common patient characteristics were associated with treatment completion. We found that treatment completion was higher in patients who took a newly introduced oral treatment compared to those who took the traditional injectable treatment. We did not find a difference in treatment completion between patients living close to the clinic and those living further away, however we found that those living further were more likely to present with more advanced disease. The results from this study suggest that management for patients living far from care needs to be improved. The newly recommended oral treatment makes it feasible to provide care away from health centres and the improved treatment completion seen in this study supports its use. However, further research should be conducted to determine how fully community based care can best be provided.
