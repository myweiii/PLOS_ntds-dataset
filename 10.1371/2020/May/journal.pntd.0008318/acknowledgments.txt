Sincere thanks to The Carter Center (TCC) for providing their support for this research. The research would not have been possible without the additional support of the Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population (MSPP) and IMA World Health. Specific thanks to the following people: Madsen Beau de Rochars, Stephen Blount, Gregory Noland, Franck Monestime, Karyn DeLuca, Shanaika Grandoit, Dorie Josma, and Cassandra Savino.
Additionally, the authors wish to express their deep gratitude to all LF MDA drug distribution team members and to the community members of Port-au-Prince who volunteered their time to participate in these interviews.
The important insights reported in this study were only possible because of the cooperation of the Haiti National Program to Eliminate LF team and their willingness to participate in this process of constructive scrutiny of their policies and practices. We are grateful to the entire LF elimination team in Haiti and applaud them for their commitment to learning and transparency, and their dedication to the continuous improvement of their own program, which we hope will also benefit LF elimination teams worldwide.
