In order to eliminate lymphatic filariasis from a region, the World Health Organization recommends a strategy of preventative drugs delivered annually to the population. At least 65% of the population must participate for four to six consecutive years for this approach to be effective. In urban Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the number of people taking the drugs has been declining progressively below the 65% benchmark since 2012. We used a qualitative case study to identify key factors behind the decline in coverage in Port-au-Prince and ways to address them. We found that the lymphatic filariasis elimination program lacks the necessary design and program infrastructure to ensure reliable learning about problems faced by pill distribution teams on the ground, and the improvisations they introduced to address these challenges. The inability to incorporate these lessons into program improvements and refinements resulted in under-performance and contributed to the decline in coverage. Furthermore, the way that people experience the program is strongly influenced by a host of contextual factors, which shape potential participantsâ€™ experience of the program and, in turn, influence their reasoning and decisions to take, or not take, the pills.
