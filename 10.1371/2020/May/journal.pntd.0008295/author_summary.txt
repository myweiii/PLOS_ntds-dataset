Genetic epidemiology is gaining widespread interest as a tool that can enhance conventional malaria surveillance. However, few studies have assessed the utility of molecular analyses in quantifying long-term changes in malaria transmission. The current study compared changes in the genetic diversity and structure of co-endemic P. vivax and P. falciparum populations sampled over 14 years (2004–2017) in Papua Indonesia, during which the incidence of both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria halved. The study found larger genetic changes in P. falciparum than P. vivax, reflecting a greater impact of local interventions, including the implementation of a new drug policy (universal Artemisinin-Based Combined Therapy) in 2006, on P. falciparum. Both species exhibited decreasing complexity of infections over time, consistent with declining transmission. However, the P. falciparum population showed greater evidence of a recent bottleneck than the P. vivax population. Four subpopulations were observed amongst the P. falciparum isolates, one of which predominated in 2016–2017, potentially reflecting recent adaptation. The results concur with epidemiological studies performed in the same area, that found declining transmission in both species, with less impact on P. vivax infections. Radical cure to treat the dormant liver stages may enable larger reductions in P. vivax transmission. The results support the great potential of molecular surveillance in complementing traditional malariometric approaches.
