Tsetse flies (Glossina spp) are the vectors of the African sleeping sickness. We derived expressions for the extinction probability, and mean time to extinction, of closed populations of G. m. morsitans experiencing different levels of fixed temperature. Temperature plays a key role in tsetse population dynamics: no population of G. m. morsitans can escape extinction at constant temperatures < 16°C or > 32°C. The effect of temperature is more severe if tsetse populations are already depleted. Increasingly high temperatures due to climate change may alter the distribution of tsetse populations in Africa. The continent may witness local extinctions of tsetse populations in some places, and appearances in places hitherto too cold for tsetse.
