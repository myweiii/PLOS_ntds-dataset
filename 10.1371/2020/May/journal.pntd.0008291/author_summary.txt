Areas endemic for skin-related neglected tropical diseases, or skin NTDs, also show high prevalence rates for other skin diseases. It is important to gauge the understanding of the people’s knowledge, attitudes and practices towards these more common skin diseases as well as their impact. This study was conducted in communities of the western African country, Côte d’Ivoire where there is co-endemicity of skin NTDs, including leprosy and Buruli ulcer. Ignorance and neglect of skin diseases in general were observed, due to the high prevalence and also their perceived minimal impact on children’s daily lives. However, some children were shown to have been affected significantly by their skin disease through our interviews and questionnaires. Our study results suggest a critical need for awareness raising activities, or skin health promotion, which supports changing health seeking behavior for skin conditions to aid in early detection and treatment of the skin NTDs. This may also be advantageous for those affected by other skin diseases. Messages need to be developed with care during delivery of education to avoid creating negative images of diseases, and further, stigma and discrimination.
