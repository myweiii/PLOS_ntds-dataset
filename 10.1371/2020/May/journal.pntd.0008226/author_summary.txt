Current World Health Organization recommendations for the treatment of trachoma state that hyperendemic districts, districts with a 30% or greater prevalence of the clinical sign trachomatous inflammation-follicular, should receive 5 years of annual mass drug administration with antibiotic to target Chlamydia trachomatis as part of the surgery, antibiotic, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement (SAFE) strategy. After approximately 5 years of SAFE in Amhara region, Ethiopia, however, many districts remained hyperendemic as measured by observed clinical signs. Given the persistent nature of trachoma in Amhara, a better understanding of the nature of actual Chlamydia trachomatis infection, including the distribution of infectious load within children, would be helpful for Amhara and for programs serving other hyperendemic regions. From 2011 to 2015 nearly 7,500 ocular swabs from 4 endemic zones were collected to monitor Chlamydia trachomatis following 5 years of SAFE among children aged 1 to 5 years, the group most at risk for infection. It was determined that pre-school age children still harbored considerable infection. The youngest children had the highest infection prevalence and highest infectious load burden, and therefore likely contributed in meaningful ways towards the persistent active trachoma observed in some districts. Treatment regimens focused on the youngest children or children harboring the highest infectious loads should be explored to help countries experiencing persistent trachoma reach elimination as a public health problem faster.
