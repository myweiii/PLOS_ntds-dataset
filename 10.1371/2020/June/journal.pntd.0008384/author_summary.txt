Taenia solium-neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a neglected parasite infection in humans causing a variety of neurological sequelae like epilepsy, and chronic headache. The purpose of this study was to estimate the burden of NCC in Ecuador using official nation-wide databases from the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) for the period of 2013–2017, and to assess for spatial clusters of four neurological disorders associated with NCC. The burden of NCC measured in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) was estimated in 3.54 to 3.56 DALY per 1000 population. Several significant spatial clusters for augmented risk of disease were identified along the country for NCC and its sequelae, most of which converged in the southern Sierra provinces. Our study suggests a possible spatial correlation between the presence of NCC cases and a higher prevalence of neurological conditions like epilepsy, status epilepticus, migraine, and hydrocephalus in several ‘hot spots’ of the southern provinces of Ecuador, indicating possible areas where the application of preventive measures is necessary to reduce cysticercosis transmission rates.
