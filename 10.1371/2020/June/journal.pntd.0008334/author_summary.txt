On a global scale, snakebite envenoming causes more than 100,000 human deaths annually, as well as pain, terror, or serious disabilities in about 5 million victims, as reported by the World Health Organization. However, accurate data from community-based surveys are lacking, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our aim was to assess the burden of snakebite in Akonolinga health district in Centre Region, Cameroon. We conducted a cross-sectional household survey in 20 randomly selected villages. Our study shows that about 6.6 victims per 1,000 inhabitants are bitten by a snake yearly, and that 3% of those victims die. The two victims who died in our survey were children who did not receive antivenom. Among all victims, 59% presented with severe symptoms, but only 3% received antivenom, and the majority used some traditional treatment. Consulting traditional healers was associated with clinical severity and medical complications. In summary, we found three main problems: a high burden in terms of incidence, severity and death; a lack of access to antivenoms; and the common use of potentially harmful traditional practices (causing delay and complications). This could represent tens of thousands of victims on a national level. We suggest conducting a country-wide representative study.
