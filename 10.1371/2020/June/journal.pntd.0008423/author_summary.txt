Scabies is a skin disease caused by parasitic mites that burrow into the skin and cause itchiness and rash. Since these mites can be easily transmitted from person to person the disease is highly contagious. Many guidelines on the treatment of scabies recommend that all family members and close contacts of persons suffering from scabies should be treated alongside the affected person, in order to prevent the disease from spreading. However, there is only little evidence to be found in the medical literature on how well this practice works. We conducted a study in Lambaréné, Gabon and surrounding villages, where many cases of scabies occurred at the time, to answer this question. We found that, on average, those patients whose entire family was treated were more likely to be cured after 4 weeks, and that fewer of their family members were affected. However, the difference to patients whose families weren’t treated was smaller than expected, suggesting that larger studies are needed to definitively answer the question.
