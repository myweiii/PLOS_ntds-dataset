In patients with β-thalassemia, regular blood transfusions increase patient survival but increase the risk of acquiring blood-borne viral infections, especially viral hepatitis. The SEN virus (SENV) is associated with non-A-E hepatitis but its exact role in the pathogenesis of liver disease remains unknown. This study investigated the frequency of SENV infections among Iraqi patients with thalassemia, with and without hepatitis C infections. The study revealed that the prevalence of SENV infections is significantly higher in patients with β-thalassemia, regardless of their hepatitis C infection status, than in a healthy population of blood donors. The two most common genotypes of the virus (D and H) have generally similar physiological impacts as both increase the levels of markers of hepatic dysfunction in thalassemia patients. However, SENV-H infections were associated with significantly higher levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase in HCV-negative patients with thalassemia, potentially predicting hepatocellular carcinoma development. Although thalassemia patients demonstrated significantly lower levels of the antioxidants vitamins C and E, compared with healthy donors, only the levels of glutathione peroxidase (another antioxidant) were significantly lower in SENV-infected patients than in non-SENV-infected patients. This study aids our understanding of the differential effects of SENV-D and SENV-H infections in β-thalassemia patients.
