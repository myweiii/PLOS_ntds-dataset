Inflammatory chemokine receptors such as CXCR3 play an important role in T lymphocytes migration into an infected tissue during Th1 response. Recently, the role of CXCR3 as a co-stimulatory molecule was demonstrated, and T lymphocytes from CXCR3 deficient mice had impaired effector function. CXCR3 receptor was highly expressed on specific CD8+ T cells after challenge with T. cruzi, and the hypothesis of that molecule is important for CD8+ T cells activation, migration and functionality was raised. We used the anti-CXCR3 neutralizing antibody approach and demonstrated that C57BL/6 treated mice died very quickly due to T. cruzi infection, and specific CD8+ T cells had decreased effector phenotyping, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity. In addition, anti-CXCR3 treatment decreased the number of dendritic plasmacytoid cells in the lymphoid tissues. The lower quantity of dendritic plasmacytoid cells in those tissues might contribute to the decrease in CD8+ T cells activation. Overall, CXCR3 molecule seems to be an important molecule to be explored during vaccine against Chagas disease strategies.
