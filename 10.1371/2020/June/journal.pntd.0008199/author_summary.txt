Dengue fever results in a self-limiting, non-specific febrile illness. In approximately 10% of cases, the disease progresses to a severe, life-threatening syndrome. While hematological derangement is a key indicator of dengue, the mechanisms by which pathophysiological changes occur over the course of infection remain unclear. Additionally, there are limited clinical algorithms to facilitate rapid prognosis of dengue. We conducted a prospective clinical cohort study in Caracas, Venezuela to determine whether clinical and hematological parameters could distinguish dengue fever from other febrile illnesses, and identify early prognostic biomarkers of severe disease. Piecewise linear mixed effects regression models demonstrate that rates of change of albumin, fibrinogen, lymphocytes, platelets and thrombin time were significantly different between dengue and other febrile illnesses, and that the absolute value of albumin, fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex, thrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were prognostic of severe dengue on the day of defervescence. Our study offers extended insights into dengue pathogenesis and provides new approaches to dengue diagnosis and severity prognosis.
