Soil-transmitted-helminthiases and schistosomiasis have major programs for control within the neglected tropical diseases agenda. Deworming programs, that is, periodic mass drug administration, with albendazole or mebendazole and praziquantel, for at-risk populations, are the main strategy for control and success in interrupting the transmission of these diseases. But despite huge efforts made, programs are still unsuccessful in controlling STH in endemic areas in Africa. In Ethiopia most parts of the country are suitable for helminth transmission. Mapping for identification of risk areas for hookworm, A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and Schistosoma spp., has been conducted by the government, in order to prioritize the health agenda. The focus of the interventions are school- aged children. Another species of soil-transmitted helminth, Strongyloides stercoralis, of high morbidity, which requires special laboratory methods for diagnosis and a different treatment drug, is highly underestimated and not included in control programs. With the aim of knowing the prevalence of S. stercoralis and other intestinal helminths at the community level, a population in the rural area of north-western Ethiopia was studied using parasitological and molecular techniques. A high prevalence of helminths at the community level and specifically a high prevalence of S. stercoralis were detected. These results suggest there is a need to revise control programs in order to be able to cut transmission and to ensure universal health coverage that â€œleaves no one behind".
