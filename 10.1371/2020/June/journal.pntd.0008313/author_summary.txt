A newly developed one-step reagent strip test for detection of S. mansoni circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine was evaluated in different countries and claimed that it has high sensitivity as well as specificity for the epidemiological study of schistosomiasis. However, it is of practical importance to evaluate the effectiveness of such a new technique in several schistosomiasis-endemic areas prior to its application for routine diagnosis or epidemiological study of the disease. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate this new method in order to be adopted and applied in the Sudan to improve the diagnosis and to assist in the control of schistosomiasis. 489 school children in central Sudan were examined for stool and urine using Kato-Katz technique and CCA strip test for S. mansoni infection. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of the CCA test were 96%, 85.4%, 78.5% and 97.5% respectively. The CCA strip test also showed high accuracy in monitoring of treatment 93.8% and 100% after three and six weeks of administration of Praziquantel respectively. Therefore, the uses of urine CCA strip test in the field would provide more accurate information on the epidemiology and monitoring of the Schistosoma mansoni infection in endemic areas of schistosomiasis. Additional assessment is recommended in areas with lower schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity levels.
