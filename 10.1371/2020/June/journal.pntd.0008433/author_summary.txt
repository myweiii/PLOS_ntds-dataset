The importance of mosquitoes for Public Health in Europe increased dramatically with the introduction of alien species considered to be competent vectors of important human pathogens (e.g. dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses), which autochthonous mosquitoes are not yet known to transmit. The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), the Asian bush mosquito (Aedes japonicus), and Aedes koreicus are particularly of relevance, as they are expanding their range in Europe. Tyrol, a region in the Alps with main transport routes from Italy to Germany is of high relevance for the spread of potential invasive, alien Aedes mosquitoes. In this study, we demonstrate highways to be points of entry, and point to possible establishment of the Asian tiger mosquito and the East Asian bush mosquito in Tyrol (findings at highways and urban areas). Moreover, we report the first findings of Ae. koreicus in Austria, this species having most probably spread from neighbouring populations in Italy.
