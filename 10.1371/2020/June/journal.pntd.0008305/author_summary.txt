The dengue virus is endemic in many low- and middle-income countries, including Burkina Faso. Since 2013, successive seasonal epidemics in the country have resulted in many deaths that could have been prevented if health professionals had been better trained. Although recent studies have reported the presence of the virus in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, several cases of dengue fever have been reported that were misdiagnosed and treated incorrectly. Video is a promising knowledge transfer (KT) tool to address the training needs of health workers. The ease with which a video can be shared, and its playful nature makes it a particularly attractive tool for reaching and training them and transforming their practices, especially, given their busy schedules. The study addresses the use of video as a KT strategy in relation to the narrative genre, i.e., how information is presented. It contributes to the advancement of knowledge on what motivates the use of video as a KT tool and practice changes in working contexts where professionals need to know how to respond, quickly and appropriately, to health problems such as dengue and other emerging pathologies in Africa.
