Naegleria fowleri is a unicellular amoeba living in warm freshwater that is able to infect humans and cause a serious and mostly fatal disease with rapid progression. When water with the amoeba enters the nose, Naegleria penetrates the mucosa and invades the human brain, where it destroys cells and causes massive inflammation. It is a rare infection with unspecific symptoms, which slows the critical process of identifying the cause of the disease. Iron is a necessary element for all living organisms used in many biological pathways; therefore, iron acquisition and iron metabolism have the potential to be exploited against this parasite to clear or slow the infection. It was discovered that N. fowleri is unable to efficiently regulate iron uptake in an environment with a low iron concentration and merely changes its energy metabolism to handle the lack of this element. Because of this limited response, N. fowleri is more sensitive to low iron conditions than are human cells, and treatment by iron chelators has the potential to kill the pathogen or slow the infection in the host.
