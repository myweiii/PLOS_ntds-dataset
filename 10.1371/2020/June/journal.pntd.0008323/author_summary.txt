In recent years, malaria initiatives have increasingly shifted focus from achieving malaria control to achieving malaria elimination. However, the interventions used are leading to drastic changes in the proportions of different Plasmodium species causing clinical infection, particularly within Southeast Asia. Little is known about how these different parasite species interact/compete in nature or whether exposure to one species could cause some level of protection against another. We examined cross-reactive antibody responses to key parasite proteins with roles in red blood cell invasion and identified novel cross-species reactivity among the closest of malaria affecting the human population (P. vivax and P. knowlesi). This comprehensive analysis provides evidence that cross-reactive immunity could play an important role in areas where species distributions are perturbed by malaria control measures, and future efforts to identify the specific cross-reactive epitopes involved would be invaluable both to our understanding of malaria immunity and vaccine development.
