Rabies virus is the deadliest virus affecting mammals. In Latin America, rabies transmitted by vampire bats is one of the most recognized zoonoses affecting humans and livestock. For unknown reasons, species such as bats and cattle can produce antibodies against rabies that clear viral infection prior to the development of deadly clinical signs. However, the extend of this phenomenon in naturally exposed populations remains unknows. In this study, we detected anti-rabies antibodies among cattle and, for the first time, goats and sheep bitten by vampire bats across as large geographic area endemic of vampire bat rabies in South Peru. We also showed that the presence of antibodies in livestock can indicate the past and future levels of cattle mortality due to rabies in the area. Future research should resolve the within-host biology underlying clearance of rabies infections and evaluate if antibody detection of healthy animals can be used for monitoring vampire bat rabies risk.
