In helminthes, Excretory-secretory products (ESPs) contains a wide range of molecules, including proteins, lipids, glycans, and nucleic acids, that assist in the penetration of host defensive barriers, reduction of oxidative stress, and avoid the host immune attack. It has been known as a key factor for parasite development, including feeding, invasion and molting. Therefore, ESPs is a valuable target for the investigation of the host-parasite relationships. However, only a few researches about the function of Angiostrongyliasis cantonensis ESPs have been verified to date. Angiostrongyliasis cantonensis, a blood-feeding nematode, and it is an important causative agent of eosinophilic meningitis and meningoencephalitis in human. Recent our studies have demonstrated that the A. cantonensis ESPs can induce oxidative stress, apoptosis, and immune response. In this study, we will use a mouse astrocytes as a model to investigate the signaling mechanisms of autophagy induction by ESPs treatment. First, the Microarray, Western blotting, and Transmission electron microscopy data demonstrated that A. cantonensis ESPs can induce autophagy generation in astrocytes. Next, ESPs-induced autophagy was activated via Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, and it has a protective potential for astrocytes. These finding will provide new insights into the mechanisms and effects of the A. cantonensis ESPs.
