Chagas disease (CD) is a serious public health problem in Latin America and has a strong social impact worldwide. Up to 30% of the infected people may have cardiac alterations, which are associated with a worse prognosis and with high mortality rates. The occurrence of CD is associated with contexts of social vulnerability. However, no studies have been identified that assessed whether unfavorable social contexts are related to the prognosis and evolution of CD, which is the purpose of our study. We evaluated 1,637 patients with CD who lived in 21 municipalities located in regions to which CD is endemic in Brazil, over a two-year period. Of these people, 12.5% ​​evolved into a worse prognosis. Our study revealed that socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals were not isolated protagonists of the evolution of CD. The context in which individuals lived was also a determining factor of a worse prognosis, including living in municipalities with a smaller rural population, fewer physicians, and a smaller Primary Health Care (PHC) coverage. Thus, we observed that characteristics related to the health care available in the municipalities influenced the evolution of CD. This knowledge has the potential to support health care planning that is more appropriate for the evolution of patients with CD, especially considering poor and remote regions.
