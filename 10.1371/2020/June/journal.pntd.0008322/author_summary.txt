In low-income rural settings of Africa, populations are commonly affected by multiple parasitic diseases. Some of these diseases have been targeted for elimination through dedicated national or international programs. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined a specific strategy to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, the disease responsible for elephantiasis, in central Africa. This strategy consists in treating the whole population living in endemic areas every six months with a single donated drugâ€”albendazole. Together with the use of the night bed nets distributed as part of malaria programs, it was expected that this strategy could interrupt the transmission and eliminate lymphatic filariasis locally within period of 4 to 7 years. Here, we evaluated this strategy in two endemic communities near Bandundu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We also assessed the impact of the semiannual community treatments on three species of gastrointestinal parasitic worms. Our results suggest that semiannual MDA with albendazole is effective for LF elimination in Central Africa, but they also indicate that drug-based only intervention is not enough to eliminate gastrointestinal worm infections in areas with high transmission.
