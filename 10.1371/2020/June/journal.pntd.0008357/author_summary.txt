The macrolide toxin mycolactone is the key virulence factor of Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of the chronic necrotizing skin disease Buruli ulcer. Mycolactone has cytotoxic activity and is secreted by the mycobacteria, causing tissue necrosis and immunosuppression. For research on Buruli ulcer, there is urgent need for a simple tool to quantify mycolactone. Using the first mycolactone-specific monoclonal antibodies that we have described previously, we have optimized here an antigen competition ELISA that detects common natural variants of mycolactone at a low nanomolar scale. Sensitivity of the assay is sufficient to detect the toxin in M. ulcerans culture supernatants and in the tissue of experimentally infected animals. Converted into a simple point-of-care test format, the competition assay may in future also be suitable as a diagnostic laboratory test for Buruli ulcer.
