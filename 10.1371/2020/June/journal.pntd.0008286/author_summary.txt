Among neglected tropical diseases, foodborne trematodiases rank among the least studied, especially in the Americas. In Ecuador, a parasite of the genus Amphimerus, family Opisthorchiidae, has been found in the biliary ducts of humans, cats, and dogs, in the northern province of Esmeraldas. Reports as old as 1949 document opisthorchiid infections in the coastal province of Manabí. Given a lack of studies elucidating the infective larval stage of these flukes in Ecuador, we decided to conduct parasitological and molecular experiments to characterize the presence of these human liver infections in the area. We found adult Amphimerus sp. flukes in humans and other domestic animals, and its metacercariae in four edible freshwater fish species: Rhoadsia altipinna, Bryconamericus bucay, Andinoacara rivulatus, and Piabucina aureoguttata. Moreover, we found a prevalence of 35.8% of small trematode eggs in humans. Finally, we also found the metacercariae of the intestinal fluke Haplorchis pumilio in all fish species examined. Our findings confirm the area of Pedro Pablo Gómez as an endemic region for opisthorchiid liver infections due to Amphimerus sp., and expand the human differential diagnosis of small trematode eggs to liver and intestinal flukes. Consumption of undercooked freshwater fish of the species identified here could lead to Amphimerus sp. infections. Surveillance in other areas known for raw fish consumption would likely unveil new cases of foodborne trematodiases in Ecuador and other regions.
