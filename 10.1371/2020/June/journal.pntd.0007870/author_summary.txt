Mosquito-borne viruses, such as Zika, are an urgent public health threat, particularly in tropical, low-income regions. Vector control, the main strategy for combatting outbreaks, can be challenging because the urban-adapted, container-breeding mosquitoes that transmit these viruses often exhibit metapopulation dynamics, where mortality in one population is compensated by migration from neighboring populations. The timing and spatial distribution of vector control efforts can therefore have a large impact on their efficacy. Using a model of virus transmission and vector population dynamics, we demonstrate that local mosquito control initiatives aimed at reducing the burden of Zika and other mosquito-borne infections are most effective when there is communication of surveillance findings among neighboring control agencies and coordination over the timing of mosquito reduction treatments. We find that local communication improves epidemic outcomes even when it imposes costs to resource-limited control agencies due to gains in the efficiency of mosquito control from spatial coordination.
