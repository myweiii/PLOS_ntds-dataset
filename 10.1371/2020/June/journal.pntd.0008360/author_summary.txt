Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect the life of more than a billion people, particularly those living in vulnerable conditions. Five priority strategies exist to prevent and control these diseases that require the adoption of preventive or control behaviors. Social marketing is an approach to behavior change that can help address NTDs. This study aimed to examine social marketing interventions focusing on NTDs using a systematic review of the literature. This qualitative study examined the characteristics, breadth of coverage, and outcomes of interventions for the prevention and control of NTDs. This was done using the Hierarchical Model of Social Marketing framework consisting of one principle, four concepts, and five techniques. The 20 Interventions retrieved were implemented in 13 countries, focused on eight diseases, and addressed four public health strategic interventions for NTDs. Most interventions incorporated the concepts “relationship building” and “public / people orientation focus”, and the technique “insight-driven segmentation”. Findings show that the interventions were successful in generating changes in behavioral determinants, behavior change, and health outcomes and that social marketing can be used to prevent and control NTDs. It is recommended that the new NTD Roadmap integrates this approach to behavior change.
