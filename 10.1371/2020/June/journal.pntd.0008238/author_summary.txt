Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a tick-borne viral disease is a zoonotic priority disease in Pakistan. During the current study, we found a mortality rate of 40.7% due CCHF which is high in comparison to studies from regional countries Iran, Afghanistan and Oman. The disease was commonly associated with people involved in animal husbandry and farming however other occupations were also affected. High proportion of cases was observed in the summer months, around the Eid-Al-Ahda festival. Genetic analysis revealed Pakistani CCHF viruses to be closely related with strains from bordering countries Iran and Afghanistan as well as with Oman indicating that animal trade and movement of people serve as a common source for the disease transmission.
