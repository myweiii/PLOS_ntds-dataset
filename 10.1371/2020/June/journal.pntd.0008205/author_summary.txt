Many important diseases are spread by Aedes mosquitoes including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. Dengue cases are increasing worldwide and there is a lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, mosquitoes have become resistant to commonly used insecticides. Pyriproxyfen (PPF) is an insecticide that prevents juvenile Aedes mosquitoes from becoming adults. The objective of this review was to determine the effect of PFF on percentage inhibition of emergence to adulthood, larval mortality, and resistance ratios and determine different use cases, strengths, and limitations. A systematic search was applied to scholarly databases where 67 full text articles met the inclusion criteria. Nearly all included studies fit in four categories, 1) granules, 2) auto-dissemination, 3) ultra-low volume spray, thermal fogging, and fumigant formulations, and 4) mosquito resistance. While mosquito populations were still susceptible to PPF, the concentrations needed to kill a majority of mosquitoes increased among those resistant to temephos (a commonly used insecticide). The evidence is strong that PPF granules do increase immature mortality and adult inhibition, however evidence for other forms and uses is still weak or could be increased. Better understanding of the cross-resistance between PPF, temephos, and other insecticides will allow control teams to make better informed decisions.
