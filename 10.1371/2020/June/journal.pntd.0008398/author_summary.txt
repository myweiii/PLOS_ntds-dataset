Less than 1% of persons in the United States with Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the cause of Chagas disease, have received antiparasitic treatment. In this paper, we examine the status of access to benznidazole in the United States following its approval by the FDA for treatment of Chagas disease treatment in 2017 and its commercialization in 2018. We found that the average number of patients who received benznidazole from the manufacturer increased after commercialization from just under 5 (when distributed by the CDC) to 13 patients (when sold in commercial channels) per month. We identified various barriers to access to treatment such as problems in the drug ordering process, low demand from health care providers, inadequate clinical assessment of patient eligibility for treatment, obstacles for patients to make medical appointments or to pay medical costs, and weak coordination among key actors in the health system. To overcome these access barriers, we propose strategic actions that can be taken by the pharmaceutical producer in collaboration with other key actors. Our work contributes to expanding access to Chagas disease treatment in the United States, and our approach could be applied to efforts to expand access to health products for other neglected diseases.
