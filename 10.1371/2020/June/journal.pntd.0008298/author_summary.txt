Lymphatic filariasis (LF) also known as “elephantiasis” is caused by infection with filarial worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. The Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF) aims to interrupt disease transmission through annual rounds of mass drug administration (MDA). Several studies have shown that a single dose of a triple-drug therapy (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole or IDA) was superior to a single dose of the standard double-drug therapy (diethylcarbamazine and albendazole or DA) and might accelerate LF elimination. In Northern Haiti, we performed a large community treatment study to compare the safety and efficacy of three-drug and two-drug therapies. Almost 6,000 participants were treated with IDA or DA and tested for LF. Each participant was assessed for adverse events (AE) and participants who tested positive for LF at enrollment were retested one year after treatment. Less participants who received IDA (11.0%) experienced AEs compared to participants who received DA (17.3%). IDA was also more effective to eliminate microfilariae (adult worm offspring) from the blood compare to DA. Results from this study showed that IDA was well tolerated in Haiti and has the potential to accelerate LF elimination in countries that currently use DA if high MDA coverage can be achieved.
