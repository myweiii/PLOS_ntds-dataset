Urogenital schistosomiasis, caused by parasitic trematode Schistosoma haematobium is a significant source of morbidity in sub Saharan Africa. HIV infection caused by a retrovirus is of two subtypes HIV 1 and HIV 2, with subtype HIV 1 being found worldwide and more aggressive, leading to HIV/AIDS. Research on both of these diseases in the same settings, has shown that these diseases cross paths. This has led to the suggestion that there could be a possible association between the two. Here we describe a systematic review that was carried out to determine if there is an association between UGS and HIV/AIDS infections. We searched all published articles available in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health (CABI), and Global Index Medicus before 28th January 2020. We found eight observational studies eligible to be included in the systematic review and no intervention study. Six of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. A summarized meta-analysis of the study findings with adjusted OR showed that there was a likely association between urogenital schistosomiasis and HIV/AIDS infections in females. However, due to limited papers in males, no conclusion could be drawn.
