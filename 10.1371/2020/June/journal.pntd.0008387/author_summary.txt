Stunting (poor linear growth) is a major global problem. Stunting affects one-third of the half-billion preschool children in low and middle-income countries and is associated with ~20% of all-cause deaths before age five. Stunting is believed to be a consequence of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED). EED is a gut inflammatory process that is endemic in children living in low and middle-income countries. EED and, by extension, stunting are thought to have microbial origins. However, attempts to find specific pathogens that drive (or protect from) EED have not been fruitful. Here, we define the comprehensive gut virome, which includes viruses that infect humans and animals and viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophage) and the bacterial gut microbiome in rural Malawian children. These participants are very well characterized (with careful growth measurements and intestinal permeability testing), enabling us to more precisely correlate the populations of viruses and bacteria in their stool with how well, or how poorly, the children are growing. We found thirty bacterial species and three bacteriophage that were differentially associated with linear growth in the three months after sampling. We found a positive correlation between bacteria and bacteriophage richness in children with subsequent adequate and moderate linear growth which children with subsequent poor growth lacked. Our data suggest that disrupting the bacteria-bacteriophage equilibrium between bacteria and bacteriophage communities might impair childhood linear growth.
