Mosquito-borne viruses pose a serious threat to public health worldwide. For an efficient preparedness to future emergences, an early detection of arboviruses in vector populations would be wise before animal/human cases arise. Here, we used a recently developed high-throughput chip based on the BioMark Dynamic arrays system, capable of screening various arboviruses in a single experiment. By examining 1,212 mosquitoes collected in Iran, we provide evidence that chikungunya virus is circulating in Iran.
