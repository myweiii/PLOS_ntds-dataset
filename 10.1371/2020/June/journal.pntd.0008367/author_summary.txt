The efficacy of the Biogents Sentinel traps, the gold standard for catching Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, is impacted by various factors. We investigated environmental influences on BGS trap catches of Ae. aegypti during a “rear and release” program using control sites, not containing manipulated populations, and treatment sites where males infected with Wolbachia were released. We found BGS trap catches to be influenced by premises vegetative characteristics, potential larval habitats, trap placement factors and the amount of residential habitat surrounding trap positions. These effects varied depending on the mosquito sex, whether the trap used CO2 and whether the population was impacted by male releases. Our findings can inform a variety of programs requiring the surveillance of adult Ae. aegypti.
