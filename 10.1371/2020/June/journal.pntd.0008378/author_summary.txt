The maintenance of high prevalence of enteric parasitic diseases in human and animal populations is an indisputable fact in the current scientific context. Despite all the advances in ecology, pathology, epidemiology and treatment, the control of these diseases remains ineffective and is a major problem in public health management. New control strategies should be tested in order to optimize the actions of current preventive programs and thus reduce prevalence. These strategies should include identification and mapping of geopolitical areas experiencing a greater frequency and overlap of enteric parasitic infections, and they must include the prevalence in both canine and human populations. This study indicates that poverty is strongly associated with the parasite's frequency. In a One Health approach, it demonstrates that affirmative actions of citizenship and income can be preventive health measures, and it also demonstrates the areas in which deworming actions must be a priority through control actions based on risk.
