Dengue virus (DENV) infection is an increasingly significant threat to global health, with a yearly estimate of 390 million infections and an expected increasing burden with the rise of climate change and globalization. DENV is caused by one of the four serotypes (DENV-1-4), each of which have been associated with different immune responses and clinical manifestations. We developed a method to detect DENV serotypes by targeting the nonstructural 1 (NS1) antigen through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based assay (ELISA) with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate that our high throughput mouse-derived antibody screening method selected for optimal test performance. The antibodies were integrated into an ELISA that can distinguish between the four different dengue serotypes by serotype-specific pairing. In addition, we provide a dengue universal antibody combination that enables pan-virus detection independently of the serotype. We use the ELISA in three different countries and calculate overall and site-specific sensitivities and specificities. The assay performs optimally when levels of viremia are high during the first five days of fever.
