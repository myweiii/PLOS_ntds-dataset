Outbreaks of enterically transmitted infection, including acute hepatitis A and shigellosis, among men who have sex with men and people living with HIV have been reported in Taiwan and in many developed countries in recent years. This study reveals that the prevalence of invasive amoebiasis among newly diagnosed people living with HIV increased in Taiwan since 2012, accompanied by increasing seroprevalence of syphilis and hepatitis A virus infection. This study also shows that concurrent infections with shigellosis and giardiasis and history of syphilis were independently associated with invasive amoebiasis, which indicates that transmission of Entamoeba histolytica might have occurred through sexual behaviours that increased faecal-oral contact in this population. In the era of improved access to HIV prevention and treatment, emerging and re-emerging enterically transmitted infections, including amoebiasis, pose an ongoing health threat to at-risk individuals and the public as a whole.
