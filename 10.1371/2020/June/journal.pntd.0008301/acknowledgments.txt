The authors would like to thank all those involved from the Ministries of Health, volunteers and community members in the sentinel and spot-check site surveys for their tireless commitment to ridding the world of LF. In addition, gratitude is given to Joseph Koroma and all the partners, including USAID, RTI International, FHI 360, IMA World Health, and Helen Keller International, who supported the surveys financially and technically.
