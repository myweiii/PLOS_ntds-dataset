African trypanosomiasis is a fatal infectious disease caused by an extracellular parasite of the Trypanosoma brucei species affecting both human and livestock. The most effective immune response against this pathogen involves the production of antibodies by B cells. However, experimental trypanosomiasis model in mice has demonstrated that this parasite has evolved multiple immune evasion strategies targeting B cells. For instance, trypanosomes abolish homeostatic B cell development, the adaptive protective response against unrelated antigens as well as the progression of B-cell mediated arthritis and multiple myeloma. Here, we demonstrate that infection of resistant C57BL/6 mice impairs the development of both thymo-dependent and -independent humoral response using the well-characterized hapten-carrier NP-CGG (4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Chicken Gamma Globulin) emulsified in Alum adjuvant and NP-Ficoll models, respectively. This occurs independently of antigen specific B cell affinity and the pro-inflammatory IFNÉ£ cytokine signalling. Finally, trypanosoma abolishes the vaccine-induced memory response against another life-threatening parasite, namely malaria, in Trypanosoma brucei susceptible BALB/c mice. In summary, African trypanosomiasis abrogates diverse plasma cell-mediated effector B cell responses, independently of their specificity, affinity and host genetic background.
