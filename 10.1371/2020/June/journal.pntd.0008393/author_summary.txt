Plantar ulceration is a major cause of disability in leprosy patients. Most of the ulcers are chronic, which occur even years after completion of Multidrug therapy (MDT) and do not heal despite proper wound care and dressings. Understanding the factors associated with non-healing of plantar ulcers and identifying appropriate control measures could be one of the major interventions for preventing disability in leprosy patients. We undertook a study on 66 leprosy patients with plantar ulcers in these lines. Most of the ulcers were seen on the forefoot, with meta-tarsal bone involvement, the most vulnerable pressure point, indicating the necessity for its protection to prevent the occurrence of ulcers. Key findings from this study are a significant association of increased ulcer dimensions with low body mass index, hypertension and smoking. Further studies are required to establish the role of these comorbidities in causation and progression of ulcer.
