Bothrops atrox is a snake of major medical importance in the Amazon. Its venom is specialized to kill preys in the nature, especially because of coagulotoxic and proteolytic activities. B. atrox envenomings cause local inflammation and, in a significant proportion, systemic manifestations, namely bleeding disorders. These signs and symptoms are caused by the various toxins present in the venom of this snake, which act in the organism by different mechanisms. It is not known to what extent the composition of the venom that was inoculated by the snake that caused the envenoming can influence the patientâ€™s clinical condition. To study this subject, this work correlated the constituents of the venom with the clinical manifestations of hospitalized patients, taking advantage of the fact that many patients bring the snake responsible for the bite. The abundance of each toxin family was similar among the venom samples, but the variants composition of each toxin was highly variable. Considering the protein families, a group named metalloproteases (SVMP) presented the best correlation with bleeding disorders and edema. Some variants of venom SVMPs, and other toxin families, such as C-type lectin-like toxins (CTL) and snake venom serine proteinases (SVSP) presented correlation to signs and symptoms presented by the patients as bleeding disorders, edema, ecchymosis and blister formation. Our results show that venom composition modulates clinical manifestations of snakebites.
