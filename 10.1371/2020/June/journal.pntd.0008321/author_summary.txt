The conflict between the Kachin Independence Army and the Myanmar government armed forces has lasted for more than eight years in the Kachin State (since 9th June 2011). Control of vector-borne diseases is especially important in emergency settings of tropical regions. In 2017, a dengue outbreak occurred and then was successfully controlled in Kachin Special Region (KSR2), Myanmar. To understand further preparedness at the community level for future possible re-emergence of DF, one IDP camp and a local community were sampled to investigate peopleâ€™s health beliefs in general, knowledge and treatment-seeking and prevention behaviors related to dengue control from August to December, the local dengue transmission season in 2018. This study found that the IDPs and local Kachin residents have sound knowledge about dengue, treatment-seeking and prevention behaviors; an inconsistency exists between their religious and health beliefs due to pressure from various diseases and health problems. The community members perceived DF as a serious and life-threatening disease; however, the local health authority did not think dengue was a priority health problem. The actual situation of dengue is still not clear due to lacking laboratory test and surveillance data. In the emergency context, dengue may still be a local health threat and dengue control is particularly important. The local capacity for dengue laboratory testing and control and prevention activities should be promoted urgently. This should get more international attention and assistance.
