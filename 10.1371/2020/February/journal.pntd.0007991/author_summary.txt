Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a dermal sequel of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by the digenetic protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The parasite infects humans and replicates intracellularly within macrophages, cells normally engaged in protecting the host from pathogens. Iron plays a crucial role in microbes and mammalian cells, being needed by the former for its growth and survival, while the latter uses it for activation of the immune system by facilitating generation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the availability of iron needs to be tightly regulated to ensure its accessibility for core biological functions, and yet prevent its utilization by intracellular pathogens. Here we investigated the status of intra-macrophage iron along with expression of its transporters in patients with PKDL. Our study suggests that within monocytes/macrophages there is an enhanced entry of iron via the upregulation of CD71 and CD163 that translates into an enhanced labile iron pool and Ferritin. However, the concomitant increase in expression of iron exporters NRAMP-1 and Fpn-1 suggested the hostâ€™s attempt to deny the pathogen access to iron. This Ferritinhigh/Ferroportinhigh phenotype was in contrast to the conventional Ferritinlow/Ferroportinhigh phenotype present in alternatively activated M2 macrophages. Taken together, the control of iron homeostasis is one of the contributors in the host-pathogen interplay as it influences the course of an infectious disease by favouring either the mammalian host or the invading pathogen.
