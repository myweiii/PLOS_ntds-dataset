    "Background": "During infections involving intracellular pathogens, iron performs a double-edged function by providing the pathogen with nutrients, but also boosts the host\u2019s antimicrobial arsenal. Although the role of iron has been described in visceral leishmaniasis, information regarding its status in the dermal sequel, Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) remains limited. Accordingly, this study aimed to establish the status of iron within monocytes/macrophages of PKDL cases.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "The intramonocytic labile iron pool (LIP), status of CD163 (hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenging receptor) and CD71 (transferrin receptor, Tfr) were evaluated within CD14+ monocytes by flow cytometry, and soluble CD163 by ELISA. At the lesional sites, Fe3+ status was evaluated by Prussian blue staining, parasite load by qPCR, while the mRNA expression of Tfr (TfR1/CD71), CD163, divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1), Lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2), Heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Ferritin, Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP-1) and Ferroportin (Fpn-1) was evaluated by droplet digital PCR. Circulating monocytes demonstrated elevated levels of CD71, CD163 and soluble CD163, which corroborated with an enhanced lesional mRNA expression of TfR, CD163, DMT1 and Lcn-2. Additionally, the LIP was raised along with an elevated mRNA expression of ferritin and HO-1, as also iron exporters NRAMP-1 and Fpn-1.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "In monocytes/macrophages of PKDL cases, enhancement of the iron influx gateways (TfR, CD163, DMT-1 and Lcn-2) possibly accounted for the enhanced LIP. However, enhancement of the iron exporters (NRAMP-1 and Fpn-1) defied the classical Ferritinlow/Ferroportinhigh phenotype of alternatively activated macrophages. The creation of such a pro-parasitic environment suggests incorporation of chemotherapeutic strategies wherein the availability of iron to the parasite can be restricted."
