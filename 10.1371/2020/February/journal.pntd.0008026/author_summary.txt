Gastrointestinal anthrax is one of the forms of anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis. It is a serious but rarely diagnosed form owing to its presentation being similar to gastroenteritis illness due to other organisms. In this investigation, we ascertained that this was a gastrointestinal anthrax outbreak that was caused by consumption of beef of suspicious origin. Trace back identified the source of this beef as being from one specific butcher. All the case-patients were treated and recovered. The outbreak was controlled at the source through treatment and we provided public education of the masses about the dangers of eating meat of animals that have died of unknown causes. We additionally recommended inspection of meat before sale at butcheries to ensure that it is suitable for human consumption as well as vaccination of the animals in the region. In the long term, anthrax control requires a One-Health approach that is multisectoral, involving ministries of agriculture, animal industries and ministries of health.
