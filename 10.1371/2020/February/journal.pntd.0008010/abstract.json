    "Abstract": "To achieve the goal of eliminating dog-mediated human rabies deaths by 2030, many African countries have agreed to list rabies as a priority zoonotic disease and to undertake both short and long-term control programs. Within this context, reliable local diagnosis is essential for the success of field surveillance systems. However, a harmonized, sustainable and supportive diagnostic offer has yet to be achieved in the continent. We herewith describe the organization and outcome of a proficiency test (PT) for the post-mortem diagnosis of rabies in animals, involving thirteen veterinary laboratories and one public health laboratory in Africa. Participants were invited to assess both the performance of the Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) test and of a conventional RT-PCR. From the submitted results, while thirteen laboratories proved to be able to test the samples through DFA test, eleven performed the RT-PCR method; ten applied both techniques. Of note, the number of laboratories able to apply rabies RT-PCR had increased from four to ten after the exercise. Importantly, results showed a higher proficiency in applying the molecular test compared to the DFA test (concordance, sensitivity and specificity: 98.2%, 96.97% and 100% for RT-PCR; 87.69%, 89.23% and 86.15% for DFA test), indicating the feasibility of molecular methods to diagnose animal pathogens in Africa. Another positive outcome of this approach was that negative and positive controls were made available for further in-house validation of new techniques; in addition, a detailed questionnaire was provided to collect useful and relevant information on the diagnostic procedures and biosafety measures applied at laboratory level."
