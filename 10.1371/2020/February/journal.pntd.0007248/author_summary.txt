While rabies is a vaccine preventable disease, and despite tremendous improvements in access to healthcare, human rabies fatalities continue to occur in Thailand. Data from a voluntary, electronic hospital-based, rabies exposure and PEP surveillance system was analyzed from eight provinces in Eastern Thailand. In total 6,204 suspected rabies exposures were reported between January 1 â€“December 31, 2015, yielding a crude exposure rate of 106 reported rabies exposures per 100,000 population or 204/100,000 when adjusted for under-reporting. Dogs were the main sources of exposure and children age < 15 years and elderly aged > 60 years had the highest overall reported exposure rate. Adherence to either the intramuscular or the intradermal PEP regimen was low (15.8% for IM and 46.5% for ID). There is likely a high level of under-detection of persons seeking medical care for suspected rabies exposures in Eastern Thailand, but expanded implementation of electronic surveillance systems will likely improve reporting. Further investigation is needed to understand why rates of adherence to PEP were low. Adherence was better by the intradermal route, which provides more support for its use in situations where it is economically feasible.
