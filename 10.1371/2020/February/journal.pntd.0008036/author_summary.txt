Typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, is an acute and often life-threatening febrile illness in developing countries. Until recently, there have been limited studies focusing on the epidemiology and disease burden of typhoid in poor resource settings including Bangladesh. This study highlights the urgent need for sustained genomics based surveillance studies to monitor the population structure and ongoing evolution of AMR. Our data revealed a diverse range of S. Typhi genotypes and AMR patterns among 202 isolates collected from three urban areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Moreover, we defined a novel genotype, subclade 3.3.2 (previously typed only to clade level, 3.3) with two Bangladesh-localized clades 3.3.2.Bd1 and 3.3.2.Bd2 showing reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Our data shows a significant increase in non-H58 genotypes carrying QRDR mutations from 2012 onwards, replacing MDR H58 genotypes. Our data suggest that a shift in treatment practice towards third generation cephalosporins to control typhoid may be beneficial, in addition to the introduction of vaccination programs and improvements in water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh.
