Given the lack of information on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in Argentina, the aim of this study was to generate a national risk map to guide the implementation of surveys to determine baseline data. For this purpose, factors most associated with the presence of STHs from previous studies conducted in other countries were ranked by experts in the field through the use of an Analytical Hierarchy Process. These characteristics were grouped into categories: socioeconomic, environmental and soil characteristics. The resulting map was validated against point prevalence studies conducted in the country and it showed that the top half of the country, from the Central provinces to the North, have localities with conditions appropriate for the development of these parasites.
