The under-reporting of rabies in Nigeria may partly be attributed to a lack of adequate diagnostic facilities, which in turn leads to its neglect. The role that dog meat markets play in the epidemiology of rabies in Nigeria remains poorly defined as the activities in these markets are neither properly regulated nor reported to appropriate veterinary and public health authorities. Several diagnostic assays have recently been recommended for rabies diagnosis by the OIE. However, challenges faced in resource-limited countries like Nigeria make the use of some of the recommended assays challenging or impractical. During this study, we evaluated the most feasible OIE-recommended diagnostic assay (based on both diagnostic efficacy and cost) for decentralized laboratory diagnosis of rabies in Nigeria using dog meat markets as a case study. Our findings suggest that the dRIT is best suited for implementation in Nigeria. In addition, our results highlight the importance of confirmatory testing at a central veterinary laboratory, ensuring accurate diagnosis to facilitate improved surveillance for the progression of Nigeria towards eliminating dog rabies.
