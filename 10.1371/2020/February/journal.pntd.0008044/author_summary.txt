Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affecting humans and/or domestic animals severely impair the socio-economic development of endemic areas. One of these diseases, animal trypanosomosis, affects livestock and is caused by the parasites of the Trypanosoma genus. The most widespread causative agent of animal trypanosomosis is T. evansi, which is found in large parts of the world (Africa, Asia, South America, Middle East, and the Mediterranean). Proper control and treatment of the disease requires the availability of reliable and sensitive diagnostic tools. DNA-based detection techniques are powerful and versatile in the sense that they can be tailored to achieve a high specificity and usually allow the reliable detection of low amounts of parasite genetic material. However, many DNA-based methodologies (such as PCR) require trained staff and well-equipped laboratories, which is why the research community has actively investigated in developing amplification strategies that are simple, fast, cost-effective and are suitable for use in minimally equipped laboratories and field settings. In this paper, we describe the development of a diagnostic test under a dipstick format for the specific detection of T. evansi, based on a DNA amplification principle (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification aka RPA) that meets the above-mentioned criteria.
