Visceral leishmaniasis is a virulent disease transmitted to man by phlebotomine sand flies. Prior research has suggested the potential for fipronil-based drugs administered orally to cattle to successfully control adult sand flies feeding on cattle blood and larvae developing in cattle feces. However, field studies have yet to be conducted and uncertainties surrounding sand fly ecology may impact the success of treatment. We use an individual-based, stochastic model representing the sand fly life cycle, previously used to evaluate a number of potential fipronil-based sand fly control schemes, to investigate two of these uncertainties: 1) the percentage of sand flies feeding on cattle blood, 2) the percentage of sand flies laying eggs in cattle feces. Results indicate that changes in our assumptions regarding these two uncertainties have a significant impact on our estimates of the probable success of fipronil-based control schemes. Additionally, simulations suggest that the results are most sensitive to changes in the percentage of sand flies ovipositing in cattle feces. Hence, our results place the evaluation of fipronil-based cattle treatment within a broader ecological context and emphasize the need for novel approaches for determining the oviposition sites of sand flies.
