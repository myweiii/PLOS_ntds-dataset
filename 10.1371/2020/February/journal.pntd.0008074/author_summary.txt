Leptospirosis is a globally important zoonotic disease is caused by Leptospira spp. This disease is often difficult to diagnose because its clinical manifestations resemble those of other diseases, such as dengue and malaria. Leptospirosis is often misdiagnosed, leading to improper medical management of patients. Accurate and timely diagnosis of the disease is important because antibiotic therapy is the most effective during the early stage. Nucleic acid assays are superior to most currently available diagnostics because they provide a definitive diagnosis during the acute stage of the disease even before antibodies are detectable. Nevertheless, the choice of genetic markers for these assays remains perplexing. Hence, this study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of these genetic markers by pooling and analyzing them simultaneously. Results revealed that nucleic acid assays targeting the secY gene of leptospires had better diagnostic accuracy with the three other genetic markers coming close with good diagnostic performance. With the heterogeneity observed, there is no clear cut answer as to which of these markers is the best for diagnosing leptospirosis. Nevertheless, the analyses in this study suggested that all four markers exhibited good diagnostic measures and are promising targets for the future development of nucleic acid-based diagnostics.
