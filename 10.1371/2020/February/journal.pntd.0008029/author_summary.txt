In this study, we described how IL-32 isoforms are crucial to host defense against new world Leishmania species infections. Furthermore, by accessing the genotype frequency of genetic variations in IL32 in a cohort of Brazilian patients with American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) and controls, we have obtained indications that IL-32 is associated with disease susceptibility and the development of different clinical manifestations. Thus, this study provides us an extra evidence that the isoforms of IL-32 shape the immune response favoring the development of different cytokines produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells that might contribute to skin/mucosal inflammation and host defense.
