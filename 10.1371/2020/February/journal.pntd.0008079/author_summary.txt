Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by a protozoan of the genus Leishmania. In Brazil, the parasites are mainly transmitted through the bite of female Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies that have been previously infected with Leishmania infantum. Dogs are the main domestic reservoirs of Leishmania. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has implemented euthanasia of VL-seropositive dogs as a measure to prevent VL expansion in the country, using the Dual-Path Platform Immunochromatographic Rapid Test (TR-DPP) as the screening method and the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA EIE) as the confirmatory test for diagnosis. Dogs with positive results in both tests are considered seropositive and recommended for euthanasia. Dogs with divergent serology between these tests remain at their ownersâ€™ home and part of them become seropositive within months. Therefore, even adopting euthanasia of seropositive dogs, part of the canine population will continue to serve as a source of Leishmania infection for sand flies, causing new canine and / or human cases of the disease. Difficulties and limitations to implement the screening-culling policy are also discussed.
