In nature, females Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit the malaria parasites Plasmodium, take successive blood meals to maximize their offspring. During these blood meals, mosquitoes are exposed to a variety of microbes present in the host blood in addition to Plasmodium, the obligate parasite that causes malaria. The Trypanosoma parasites, causing trypanosomiases, are sympatric with the malaria parasites in numerous African regions, therefore, a single female mosquito could be in contact with both pathogens concurrently or through successive blood meals. In this work, we showed that exposure of females Anopheles mosquitoes to Trypanosoma enhanced their susceptibility to malaria parasites, reduced their reproductive fitness and modulated their bacterial gut flora. While the effect of trypanosomes ingestion on Plasmodium infection is microbiome dependent, the phenotype on the reproductive fitness is microbiome independent. These results highlight the need for considering the effect of eukaryotic microbes on Anopheles biology for malaria control strategies.
