Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a devastating disease that affects close to a million people every year. Its clinical presentation ranges from small uncomplicated lesions that heal over a few months to debilitating large chronic or recurring lesions that result in disfigurement, stigma, and economic loss. Antimonials are the first line treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis in most countries, but the lengthy treatment schedules, significant associated toxicities, and the emergence of resistant strains, require the development of alternative strategies. As the immune response is a key determinant of disease course, immunomodulatory therapies could be harnessed to act in concert with antimonials to improve the safety and efficacy of CL treatment. Synthetic oligonucleotide D35 selectively activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells and was previously shown to reduce the severity of L. major and L. amazonensis lesions in rhesus macaques, but its activity in combination with antimonials was unknown. Our studies show that a single subcutaneous dose of innate immune modulator D35 improved the response to a low-dose abbreviated antimonial course, reducing the severity of the lesions and accelerating healing in primates. No toxicities were evident with D35 at doses ten-fold higher than the effective dose. The studies suggest that the combined therapy strategy shows clinical promise.
