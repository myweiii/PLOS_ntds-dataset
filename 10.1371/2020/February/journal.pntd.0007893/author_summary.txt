Rickettsia felis is a flea-borne bacteria that has recently emerged worldwide as a cause of disease. Little is known about its distribution or details of transmission but typically it has been described as causing mild, self-limiting, febrile illness. It has, however, been incriminated in Mexico and Sweden of causing acute neurological disease. We report from North Sulawesi, Indonesia evidence that R. felis caused or contributed to the death of two adult men admitted to hospital with progressive meningoencephalitis. One case was a farmer and the other was an itinerant urban salesman. DNA unique to R. felis was identified in the patientsâ€™ cerebrospinal fluid using Sanger sequencing techniques. No other potential pathogens were found. These appear to be the first possible cases of fatal R. felis reported. Because rickettsial infections can usually be quickly, cheaply, and effectively treated with doxycycline and related tetracylines, it is important for clinicians in the region to consider using these antibiotics to treat suspect cases presumptively.
