Trypanosome parasites pose a significant health risk worldwide. Conventional drug development strategies have proven challenging given the high conservation between humans and pathogens, with off-target toxicity being a common problem. Protein synthesis inhibitors have historically been an attractive target for antimicrobial discovery against bacteria, and more recently for eukaryotic pathogens. Here we propose that exploiting pathogen-specific tRNA-synthetase interactions offers the potential for highly targeted drug discovery. To this end, we improved tRNA gene annotations in trypanosome genomes, identified functionally informative trypanosome-specific tRNA features, and showed that these features are highly conserved over approximately 250 million years of trypanosome evolution. Highlighting the species-specific and broad-spectrum potential of our approach, we identified natural product inhibitors against the parasite translational machinery that have no effect on the homologous human enzyme.
