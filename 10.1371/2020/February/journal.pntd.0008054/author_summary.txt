Naja atra envenomation is an important public health issue in Taiwan. Although the mortality rate of cobra snakebite is controlled using antivenom, more than half of victims develop symptoms of local necrosis and require surgical intervention. Whether the Taiwanese freeze-dried neurotoxic antivenom (FNAV) currently in clinical use is able to prevent the local necrosis extension induced by N. atra venom is still unclear. In this study, we developed a dermo-necrosis animal model using purified cytotoxins (CTXs), the major necrosis-related proteins from N. atra venom. We found that FNAV was able to neutralize the lethality of whole cobra venom, but was unable to neutralize the necrosis induced by CTXs in vivo. This finding introduced an example that supplementary quality control assays may be necessary to determine the effectiveness of antivenoms in neutralizing specific pathology induced by the venom; only evaluating the rodent lethality prevention is insufficient. Our results provide insights that should help improve current antivenoms and advance cobra snakebite management in Taiwan.
