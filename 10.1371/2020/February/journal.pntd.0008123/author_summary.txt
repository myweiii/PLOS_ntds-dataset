Mycetoma is a chronic skin disease that can invade bone or underlying organs. Inadequate treatment may lead to long-lasting disability. Information about treatment is scarce. We report the outcomes of 31 patients with a diagnosis of bacterial actinomycetoma attending a tertiary care hospital in northeast Mexico. Most cases were treated with a combination of antibiotics including TMP/SMX plus amikacin or TMP/SMX plus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Cure was achieved in 90% of patients and only one required surgery.
