Hantavirus is a pathogen spread by small rodents in many regions of the world. In Panama, infection with hantavirus can lead to Hantavirus Fever or Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome. In 2018, there were 107 cases of hantavirus infection in Panama, the majority in the Tonosí District, and 4 deaths. Currently, there is no treatment, cure, or vaccine for hantaviruses. It is important that communities carry out the recommended prevention measures. In this study, we investigated what influences people to carry out the proper prevention measures and what influences people’s knowledge of hantavirus in order to design interventions in highly affected communities. We found that barriers such as physical restrictions limit people’s ability to perform the measures. Additionally, we found that those with higher education and those that knew more people who had been sick with hantavirus were more likely to have higher knowledge of the disease. We recommend that future interventions are community-based and focus on removing obstacles to performing the recommended prevention practices and involve those who have been affected by the disease to spread information.
