Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family) and causes severe neurologic diseases. The development of safe and effective vaccine is urgent need. In this study, we constructed a novel simian adenovirus type 23 vector-based vaccine expressing ZIKV pre-membrane-envelope proteins (Sad23L-prM-E). By vaccinating the common marmosets with prime immunization of vaccine, and upon challenge with a high dose of ZIKV to the vaccinated marmosets, the immune response and protective efficacy of vaccine were extensively evaluated. The data suggested that Sad23L-prM-E vaccine could protect marmosets against a high dose of ZIKV challenge, which provided a promising vaccine for preventing ZIKV infection in humans.
