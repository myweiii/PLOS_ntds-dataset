After elimination, most of the leprosy cases were detected passively and advanced cases with longer delay and visible disability were common. In the past decade, comprehensive case-finding measures including health promotion, personnel training, reward-offering symptom surveillance and a powerful referral center were implemented successively in Shandong province after the restoration of government commitments. 231 cases detected during 2007â€“2017 were analyzed and factors associated with G2D were explored. Annual proportion of G2D among new cases showed a declining trend, from 50% in 2008 to 23% in 2017. PB type, longer delay in diagnosis, detected by other than skin-clinics and known infectious sources were associated with G2D. Even in late phase of leprosy control, some kind of leprosy control program is still necessary. Comprehensive case-finding measures based on government commitments would be beneficial to improve early detection of leprosy cases.
