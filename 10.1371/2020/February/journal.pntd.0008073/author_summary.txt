Aedes mosquitoes are the primary carriers of Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses around the globe. Given the emergence of insecticide-resistance in this genus and unprecedented ‘globalization’ of mosquito-borne viruses, new chemicals to control these mosquitoes (e.g., insecticides, repellents) are urgently needed. In the continuation of our search for new and safe natural product derived insecticides, we generated semi-synthetic derivatives of cinnamodial (CDIAL), previously identified as an insect antifeedant, repellent and insecticide, to give insights into the important features of the molecule that can contribute to the observed activities. Since the antifeedant and repellent activity of CDIAL are found to be mediated by modulation of a sensory receptor (TRPA1) in the mosquito, we developed a structural model to understand how CDIAL interacts with TRPA1 and to explain the difference in activities of CDIAL and the prepared derivatives. Our findings aid in the development of plant-derived insecticides to control the Ae. aegypti mosquito and justify continued efforts using TRPA1 as a target for new mosquito repellents.
