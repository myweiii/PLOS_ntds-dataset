The goal of this study was to characterize the transcriptional response of the digestive tract of the rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, to infection with Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. This flea is generally considered the most prevalent and efficient vector of Y. pestis. Because most pathogens transmitted by fleas, including Y. pestis, reside in the insect digestive tract prior to transmission, the transcriptional program induced in the gut epithelium likely influences bacterial colonization of the flea. To determine the specific response to infection, RNA profiles were generated from fleas that were either unfed, fed sterile blood, or fed blood containing Y. pestis. Comparative analyses of the transcriptomes resulted in identification of 34 infection-responsive transcripts. The functions of these differentially regulated genes indicate that infection of fleas with Y. pestis induces a limited immune response and potentially alters the insectâ€™s behavior, metabolism, and other aspects of its physiology. Based on these data, we describe potential mechanisms fleas use to eliminate bacteria and the corresponding strategies Y. pestis uses to resist elimination. These findings may be helpful for developing targeted strategies to make fleas resistant to microbial infection and thereby reduce the incidence of diseases they spread.
