Pathogenic Leptospira are the causative agents for leptospirosis, a neglected zoonosis occurring worldwide with the highest incidence of the disease found in the Pacific region, including French Polynesia (FP). In this study, a nested PCR of blood specimens allowed a high isolation frequency of Leptospira DNA among patients with febrile illness in FP. Infecting Leptospira isolates were characterized by sequencing of the secY gene from 244 clinical samples from 2011 to 2019. The genotypes have been assigned to Leptospira species and serogroups by comparing the secY sequences with the genomes of strains isolated prior to 2011 in FP. This study therefore enables to follow the distribution of genotypes/serogroups over a 18-year time period. Leptospiral sequences from patients were also compared with secY sequences from different animal reservoirs from a previous study in FP showing that not only rats but also dogs and pigs might play an important role in the circulation of pathogenic Leptospira strains in FP. Further progress in our understanding of the epidemiology of Leptospira circulating genotypes should contribute to the implementation of prevention and intervention measures to reduce the risk of leptospirosis transmission in FP.
