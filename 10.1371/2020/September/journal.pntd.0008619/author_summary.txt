Schistosomiasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease, which is caused by a parasite called Schistosoma. The disease is mainly manifested by bloody urine (urinary schistosomiasis) and bloody diarrhea (intestinal schistosomiasis). Schistosomiasis is usually asymptomatic during early infection but, if not treated, may cause devastating long-term complications, including poor growth and cognitive development in children, portal hypertension, and cancers. For several years, children in Sub Saharan Africa have been receiving targeted mass praziquantel treatments for the control and elimination of schistosomiasis. Despite the reported success in reducing morbidity, single dose praziquantel alone treatment is apparently insufficient for elimination of schistosomiasis in endemic countries. This is partly due to its poor activity against the immature/juvenile stage of the parasite. Previous studies reported that artemisinin derivatives are effective against juvenile worms. In this study, we explored if combination therapy of praziquantel and Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine would increase the efficacy by targeting to kill both developmental stages (matured and juvenile worms) of the parasite. In a randomized clinical trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of praziquantel and Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine against the standard praziquantel alone for the treatment of intestinal schistosomiasis in a rural endemic setting in North-Western Tanzania. Our findings indicate that praziquantel and Dihydroartemisinin piperaquine combination therapy is safe and more effective than praziquantel alone for the treatment of intestinal schistosomiasis.
