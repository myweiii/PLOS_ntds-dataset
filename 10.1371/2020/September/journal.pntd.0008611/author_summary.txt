There is increasing interest in the potential for cessation of transmission of M Leprae. In several European countries, as social and economic conditions have improved, leprosy rates have declined and transmission appears to have stopped. The epidemiology of leprosy is still not fully understood: the study of leprosy in countries with low incidence rates can give valuable information on its epidemiology that could inform eradication campaigns in other countries. Leprosy has been endemic in Spain for centuries and, despite very low incidence in the last decades, new autochthonous cases are diagnosed every year. In this study, we analyse the epidemiologic trends of autochthonous leprosy in Spain in recent years. Our data provide insights into the dramatic decline of leprosy in Spain since 1950, and, for the cases diagnosed after 2003, show a shift from a predominace of disease attributable to locally acquired infection to overwhelming predominance of disease attributable to infections acquired elsewhere. The comparison of patterns of disease between the autochthonous and imported cases shows important differences, suggesting that the most recent autochthonous cases were those with long incubation periods after infections which were acquired many years ago. The epidemiologic trends are similar to those found in other countries with declining incidence and suggest that transmission effectively stopped in Spain more than two decades ago.
