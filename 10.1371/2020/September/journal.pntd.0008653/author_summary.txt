The parasite Taenia solium causes neurocysticercosis in humans in its larval stage and is the main cause of seizure disorders in poor communities that keep pigs (the intermediate host). Diagnosis and treatment of neurocysticercosis remains beyond the reach of the general population in Madagascar. Prevention is therefore the most suitable strategy for combating this disease. Mass drug administration (MDA) is used to treat communities for several parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis. Infection with the T. solium tapeworm in people can be treated with MDA using praziquantel. Here, we conducted a pilot project in Madagascar, giving over 220,000 treatments to people in 52 villages once per year, for 3 consecutive years. The effects on taeniasis seemed to be encouraging when assessed 4 months after finishing the treatment, but 16 months later, the parasiteâ€™s prevalence had returned to its original level. MDA was effective in providing temporary control of taeniasis, but parasite transmission was not interrupted. With respect to T. solium, this highlights the need of incorporating other interventions such as vaccination and medication in pigs, improved pig husbandry and meat inspection to tackle the whole cycle of the parasite.
