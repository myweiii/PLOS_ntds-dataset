Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is an intestinal disorder common among children in low-resource settings and has been associated with increased risk of growth stunting, cognitive deficits, and reduced oral vaccine immunogenicity. A key challenge to identifying children with EED at highest risk of morbid sequelae is the lack of validated predictive biomarkers. Ongoing clinical studies are testing and validating EED biomarkers in child populations at risk for stunting, yet testing multiple biomarkers commonly requires specialized equipment, complex methods, resources, and considerable effort. The Micronutrient and EED Assessment Tool (MEEDAT) is a multiplexed immunoassay that measures biomarkers associated with child growth faltering and oral vaccine immunogenicity, and biomarkers indicative of systemic inflammation and micronutrient deficiencies. The performance of MEEDAT was well-correlated with commercial monoplex assays in specimens from children living in a low-resource setting in the present study. MEEDAT biomarkers were associated with growth outcomes and seroconversion in response to several vaccines. MEEDAT has the potential to reduce the time and cost of evaluating impact of interventions targeting EED.
