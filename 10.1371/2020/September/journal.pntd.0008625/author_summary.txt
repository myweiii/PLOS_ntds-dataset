Over the past ten years, there has been a worldwide intensification of large-scale deworming programs aimed at controlling the morbidity of intestinal worms (roundworms, whipworms and hookworms). In order to make well-founded decisions, it is of utmost importance that the program managers have access to high quality data on the prevalence and intensity of these infections, and the therapeutic efficacy of the administered drugs. In the present study, we report the results of the quality control (QC) that was performed on the diagnosis and the data entry. We analyze and discuss how QC affected the study outcomes of four clinical trials designed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of a standard deworming treatment in Brazil, Ethiopia, Lao PDR and Tanzania. Our results indicate that, when staff is aware that QC will be performed, study outcomes were not significantly affected by performing QC on both the diagnosis or the data entry. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that training, adherence to good standard operating procedures and performing QC does improve the overall quality of the data.
