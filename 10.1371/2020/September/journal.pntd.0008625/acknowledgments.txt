First and foremost, the authors would like to express their gratitude towards all children, their parents, the school teachers and principals that provided the information for this study. Second, we wish to specifically thank all the people that provided the necessary laboratory and logistic support in each of the four different sampling sites. This work would not have been possible without their willful participation and assistance.
