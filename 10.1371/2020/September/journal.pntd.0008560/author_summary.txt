Food and water-borne illness arising from the consumption of contaminated food and water are serious health hazards globally. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are the major food and waterâ€’borne parasites. The infection occurs mainly by (oo)cyst phase of the parasites. People in developing countries are more vulnerable to these parasites where infection is more likely underdiagnosed and underreported due to limited resources for detection. There is need of a method that is affordable and easy to implement. In this study, we developed and optimized a novel smartphone microscope method that can detect and quantify the (oo)cyst of the parasites in food and water samples. The developed method is easy to implement and affordable and provides similar performance to the other commercially available microscopic methods.
