Anthrax, an ancient disease largely controlled in the developed world, is still widespread in remote and rural communities of low- and middle-income countries where it affects human and animal health, and livelihoods. To control anthrax effectively, detection and accurate confirmation are important, but solutions need to be feasible for the most-affected areas where resources and infrastructure are typically limited. To achieve this, we assessed a newly proposed stain, azure B, for microscopic confirmation on animal blood smears, as this method can be implemented in low-resource laboratories and in the field. Microscopy using azure B was highly accurate compared to other recommended stains and has the added advantage of being more readily available and convenient. However, blood smear samples were unavailable for more than half of suspected cases. We therefore evaluated a molecular test (PCR) on other sample types–whole blood, blood swabs, skin, and flies–stored at ambient temperature. We show high performance of PCR with skin tissues which were available for 90% of carcasses. Thus, under field conditions, smear samples (when available) and tissue samples are most suitable for diagnostic testing of animal anthrax, whereby microscopy can be conducted in affected areas and PCR in in-country reference laboratories.
