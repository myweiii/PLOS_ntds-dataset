Trichinella spp., pathogenic agents of trichinellosis, is foodborne zoonotic nematodes cause huge economic burden to the livestock industry. The potential of new adjuvants for improving veterinary vaccines remains largely unexploited to trigger safe and long-lasting immunity in large animals, including livestock. Polysaccharides are effective, safe, and biodegradable as adjuvant. We first observed the protective efficacy of lentinan as a novel adjuvant against helminth T. spiralis infection. NLRP3 is associated with lentinan -triggering Th2 protective immunity against T. spiralis infection. NLRP3 therefore represents an important target for adjuvant discovery and the control of T. spiralis infection.
