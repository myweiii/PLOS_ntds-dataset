Mosquito-borne viral diseases including yellow fever and chikungunya are becoming major public health problem in Africa. Community-based sero-epidemiological studies of mosquito-borne viral infections are important to known the occurrence of these diseases and to design appropriate prevention and control strategies. In this study, we assessed the sero-prevalence of IgG antibody against Chikungunya virus and Yellow fever virus in 360 study participants and associated risk factors among the community members of South Omo, Southern Ethiopia. Our study showed a sero-prevalence of IgG antibody; 43.6%, (157 out of 360) to Chikungunya virus, and 49.5% (155 out of 313) against Yellow fever virus in the study participants.Further studies on active case detection of chikungunya and raising awareness, advocating policies to mitigate the risk of arboviral infections have paramount importance in the present study area.
