Melioidosis, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is an infectious disease with diverse clinical presentations including pneumonia, localised cutaneous lesion, bacteraemia without evident focus, septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, and severe sepsis with multiple organ abscesses. Therapy is prolonged, consisting of an intensive intravenous phase and an oral eradication phase. Guidelines from northern Australia have evolved and now recommend an often-longer duration of intravenous antibiotics than in prior recommendations. The Darwin melioidosis guideline, which was first published internationally in 2015 and described as a new treatment paradigm, has been associated with relatively low rates of recrudescence and relapse. We have reassessed use of this guideline and have again demonstrated low rates of recrudescence, relapse and mortality. There has been a tendency for treating clinicians to prolong intravenous phase therapy beyond the 2-week recommendation in those presenting with concurrent bacteraemia and pneumonia and in those with multi-lobar pneumonia. The 2015 guideline remains the standard for treatment recommendations for our region, but the 2020 revision now includes multi-lobar pneumonia as an indication for a minimum of 3 weeks intravenous treatment if bacteraemia is not present and 4 weeks if bacteraemia is present, while a minimum of 3 weeks is recommended for those with concurrent bacteraemia and pneumonia involving only a single lobe.
