Viral diseases like Zika and dengue fevers that are vectored by mosquitoes cause illness and death in populations worldwide. Chemical pesticides are the frontline tools used to control mosquitoes, however, development of resistance by the vectors to these agents overtime ultimately reduces effectiveness. Hence, the development of new pesticides that do not spur the development of resistance is of paramount importance. We therefore developed and characterized various types of well-defined cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria) and studied the impacts on Aedes (Ae.) aegypti mosquitoes resulting from exposure to these novel agents. We found that nanoceria not only have larvicidal potential, but also alter the life history traits (e.g., reduced egg hatch proportion and altered sex ratio) of the subsequent adult mosquitoes exposed to these nanoparticles during the larval stage. One of the most interesting and important findings of our study is that exposure of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to nanoceria via blood meals significantly reduced egg clutches apparently via arresting oocyte growth, thereby interfering with the ultimate development and production of eggs. Thus, this study reveals until-now-unappreciated impacts of nanoceria exposure on Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and helps inform how these kinds of agents can be potentially deployed in control strategies.
