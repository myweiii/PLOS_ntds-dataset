Dengue is the most rapidly expanding arbovirus in the world. Counts of reported dengue cases, as usually reported by surveillance systems, are a poor metric of the underlying transmission because most of the infections are asymptomatic. Population based serological surveys, where the prevalence of antibodies to dengue virus are measured in a random sample of the population, are considered the gold-standard to quantify dengue transmission. In this study, the authors conducted a population based serological survey in urban and rural areas of Piedecuesta, Santander, Colombia. Seropositivity was significantly higher in urban as compared to rural locations. Age was a major predictor of seropositivity, consistent with long-term circulation of the virus in this setting. They estimated that, on average, 12% of susceptible individuals living in urban locations get infected by dengue each year. The only predictor of prior dengue infection in urban inhabitants was self-reported history dengue. In rural locations, traveling regularly outside of their “vereda” (neighborhood) and having been born outside of Santander department were associated with seropositivity.
These results show that the Piedecuesta municipality is an endemic area of dengue transmission, with large heterogeneities between urban and rural settings. Control interventions, including vaccination should be targeted at fine spatial scales.
