To expand the repertoire of insecticides available for public health purposes, we explored the potential of biodegradable polyanhydride nanoparticles for localizing within specific tissues within the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, after a variety of exposures. These nanoparticles successfully migrated across the insect cuticle, one of the primary barriers to insecticide potency, and localized within specific tissues observed in this study. We also demonstrated that these nanoparticles associated with an insect cell line and were internalized within these cells. In all exposures, these nanoparticles did not produce toxicity to the exposed organisms, making them ideal carriers for future insecticides. This study demonstrates the utility of these biodegradable nanoparticles in the future of insecticide development.
