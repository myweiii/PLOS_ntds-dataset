Novel, ‘green’ mosquito control strategies like Sterile-Insect-Technique, require the production of large numbers of mosquitoes from the targeted species. Females from these species require a meal of vertebrate blood to develop their eggs. Blood requires a cold chain for shipping and storage, has a short shelf life, and handling requires trained personnel. To address this problem, we have developed an artificial blood meal replacement called SkitoSnack that does not require cooling and has a much longer shelf life than blood. For this study we raised a colony of Yellow fever mosquitoes for 30 consecutive generations on SkitoSnack to test if long-term SkitoSnack culture affected mosquito fitness and life history traits. We found that 30th generation SkitoSnack-raised mosquitoes had equivalent egg numbers and hatch rates compared to blood-raised control mosquitoes and equal fitness. We found similar results for a closely related species, the Asian tiger mosquito, which we raised for 11 generations on SkitoSnack. We also found that SkitoSnack is not suitable to raise bed bugs. Together, our results show that SkitoSnack is a suitable meal for mass culture of yellow fever mosquitoes and Asian tiger mosquitoes.
