Control methods for dengue, and other diseases which are transmitted by mosquitoes, are often tested in cluster-randomized trials. This means that whole groups of people, often defined by geographical area, are randomly allocated to receive the control method or not. These control methods often have a mass effect so that they may be stronger if applied to a whole area together. However, if the areas (clusters) are not very far apart then the effects may ‘spill over’ from one to another. In this paper we use a new spatial statistical method to re-analyse data from a cluster-randomized trial which was done in a town in Venezuela. The idea was to use insecticide treated curtains and water tank covers to try to control the mosquitoes which transmit dengue. To assess the spillover effect we calculate how much each location was surrounded by locations which got the control method. We found some evidence that the greater the surroundedness then the stronger the effect of the intervention.
