Dengue is a viral disease that results in various health conditions, ranging from strictly asymptomatic infections to life-threatening severe dengue. Here we have compared the two World Health Organization (WHO) dengue classification schemes from 1997 and 2009, which define different categories of dengue fever and have been at the root of much debate in the dengue research community. We enrolled a Cambodian pediatric cohort of hospitalized dengue-confirmed patients, with clinical and biological follow-up. Our findings demonstrate that (i) the WHO 1997 classification is a longitudinal dengue-case classification which uses strict prerequisite clinical and/or biological signs to move from one level of severity to another, and (ii) the WHO 2009 classification, being a transversal dengue-case classifier, is more flexible and when adapted with systematic use of ultrasound is more accurate in identifying severe dengue case for timely and appropriate clinical management of hospitalized patients. Our laboratory results found that lipid profiles exhibited changes and differences between different dengue severity groups at hospital.
