Chagas disease and tuberculosis are important public health problems in Bolivia, where the prevalence and incidence of these diseases are high compared to other Latin American countries. Treatment for both infections requires a long period of time, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are frequent. One of the main challenges in the management of Chagas disease and tuberculosis is poor adherence to treatment. In this context, strengthening the Bolivian pharmacovigilance system is proposed as a key issue to reinforce therapeutic strategies. Several interventions were carried out in fifteen health centers of the Department of Cochabamba and included a situation analysis of pharmacovigilance, the implementation of a new local case report form, specific training on drug safety monitoring and reporting, and follow-up visits. ADRs were also analyzed. Overall, our findings suggest that the Bolivian pharmacovigilance system still presents some challenges that should be addressed in the coming years in order to achieve a strong, integrated and consolidated ADR reporting system, which will be essential for avoiding patient abandonment and achieving therapeutic success.
