Leprosy–although use of this term is not recommended because of the negative stigma attached to it–also known as Hansen’s disease is one of the oldest diseases in the world. In modern times, we have identified the agent that causes it, we know how to diagnose it, and we know how to treat it. Nevertheless, thousands of people are still diagnosed late and even though they receive the treatment recommended, they suffer from sequelae that can be highly incapacitating. When discussing its clinical presentation, what springs to mind, even among the public, are the notorious, whitened, discolored patches of skin with sensory dysfunction, but ocular involvement caused by the Mycobacterium leprae bacteria is often ignored by patients and even health professionals. Few studies have been published worldwide reporting the true incidence of eye damage caused by Hansen’s disease and identifying which patients need special care for the eyes. It is extremely important to raise awareness and increase knowledge about these conditions, so that public policies on treatment and prevention can be established. This study found that 100% of the sample of patients with Hansen’s disease had some type of abnormality of the eyes or adnexa and that patients over the age of 50 and those with some degree of physical incapacity secondary to Hansen’s disease were at greatest risk. Another important finding was the high rate of Meibomian gland dysfunction (89.5%) and dry eye syndrome.
