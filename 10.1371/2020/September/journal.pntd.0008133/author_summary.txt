Tick-borne pathogens represent a major emerging threat to public health and in recent years have been expanding into new areas. LIV is a neglected virus endemic to the UK and Ireland (though it has been detected in Scandinavia and Russia) which is closely related to the major human pathogen TBEV, but predominantly causes disease in sheep and grouse. The recent detection of TBEV in the UK, which has also emerged elsewhere in Europe, requires more detailed understanding of the spread and sequence diversity of LIV. This could be important for diagnosis and vaccination, but also to improve our understanding of the evolution and emergence of these tick-borne viruses. Here we describe the sequencing of 22 LIV isolates which have been sampled from several host species across the past century. We have utilised this dataset to investigate the evolutionary pressures that LIV is subjected to and have explored the evolution of LIV using phylogenetic analysis. Crucially we were unable to estimate a reliable molecular clock rate for LIV and found that this problem also extends to a larger phylogeny of TBEV sequences. This work highlights a previously unknown caveat of tick-borne flavivirus evolutionary analysis which may be important for understanding the evolution of these important pathogens.
