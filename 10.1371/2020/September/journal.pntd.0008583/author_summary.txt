While multi-drug therapy (MDT) has been successful in decreasing the worldwide prevalence of leprosy, the new case detection rate, or incidence, remains consistent. These circumstances indicate that leprosy transmission is still occurring. Subclinical asymptomatic leprosy infections are considered a leading cause of ongoing transmission. One means to control this source is an effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen that would prevent both subsequent progression to clinical leprosy for the individual and transmission of the disease to others. Therefore, in this study, we used a modified kinetic mouse footpad screening assay and sensitive molecular bacterial enumeration in a susceptible-subclinical mouse model to identify effective potential PEP drug regimens for leprosy. Using these methods, we showed that a single dose PEP regimen is not effective in a susceptible host, and multiple intermittent doses of combination therapies are required. This model could provide useful pre-clinical information for the development of PEP regimens for leprosy.
