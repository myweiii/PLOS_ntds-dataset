    "Abstract": "The receptor Signaling Lymphocyte-Activation Molecule Family 1 (SLAMF1) controls susceptibility to Infection by the lethal Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain. To elucidate whether genetic diversity of the parasite was related with disease susceptibility, we further analyzed the role of SLAMF1 using 6 different Trypanosoma cruzi strains including Y. The interaction of SLAMF1 receptor with T. cruzi was evidenced by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and quantitative PCR. All the strains, except VFRA, showed a decrease in parasite load in infected macrophages in Slamf1-/- compared to BALB/c. In macrophages gene expression NADPH oxidase (NOX2), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increased in Slamf1-/- compared to BALB/c in 5 out of 6 strains. However, Slamf1-/-macrophages infected with VFRA strain exhibited a divergent behavior, with higher parasite load, lower NOX2 expression and ROS production compared to BALB/c. Parasitological and immunological studies in vivo with Y strain showed that in the absence of SLAMF1 the immune response protected mice from the otherwise lethal Y infection favoring a proinflammatory response likely involving CD4, CD8, dendritic cells and classically activated macrophages. In the case of VFRA, no major changes were observed in the absence of SLAMF1. Thus, the results suggest that the T. cruzi affects SLAMF1-dependent ROS production, controlling parasite replication in macrophages and affecting survival in mice in a strain-dependent manner. Further studies will focus in the identification of parasite molecules involved in SLAMF1 interaction to explain the immunopathogenesis of the disease."
