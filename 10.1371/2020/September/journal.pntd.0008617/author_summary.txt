The primate malaria parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, is a common cause of human malaria in Malaysian Borneo. Most knowledge about the ecology and behaviour of mosquitoes transmitting P. knowlesi in Borneo comes from a limited number of sites near the major epicentre of human infection in Kudat District, Sabah. On this basis, human exposure to vectors was predicted to be higher in human settlement areas than in farming or forest habitats. Here we aimed to characterise the diversity and abundance of P. knowlesi vectors over a wider area of Sabah to test hypotheses about vector-habitat relationships and associated human exposure risk. Working in 11 villages across 4 districts in Sabah, we found low densities of the P. knowlesi vector, An. balabacensis. However, vector densities were higher in farm and forest habitats than in villages across this broader area, in contrast to findings from small scale study in Kudat. No association was observed between mean An. balabacensis abundance and P. knowlesi seropositivity in communities; however the ability to detect such an association, even if present, was limited by the relatively small number of mosquitoes collected.
