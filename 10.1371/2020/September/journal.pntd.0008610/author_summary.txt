Tick-transmitted Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFV) causes a serious and potentially fatal disease in humans. The CCHFV polymerase possesses an N-terminal ovarian tumor-type protease (OTU) domain that cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 modifiers from target proteins. Previous studies demonstrated that the ectopically expressed OTU domain can inhibit antiviral type I interferon responses. Hence, cleavage-negative OTU mutants of virus or transcriptionally active virus-like particles (tc-VLPs) are expected to exhibit elevated immunogenicity and would be candidates for a live vaccine. For unknown reasons, however, recombinant virus with just the OTU minus mutation cannot be generated. Using tc-VLPs, we show that in human HuH-7 cells the activity of the OTU minus polymerase is reduced by more than 80%. Curiously, the attenuation could not be compensated by inactivating the interferon system or by adding the OTU domain in trans. However, a complete reversion of the OTU minus phenotype was achieved by transcomplementation with ISG15, whereas the other OTU substrate, ubiquitin, had no such positive influence. Our data thus indicate a role of cis OTU in CCHFV polymerase regulation that is independent of an anti-interferon activity but connected to ISG15. Transcomplementation with ISG15 may be a means to rescue the OTU minus CCHV vaccine candidate.
