Community-wide MDA to eliminate LF and onchocerciasis has the beneficial effect to reduce also STH infections. The objective of the current study was to determine whether five semi-annual rounds of MDA have a greater impact on STH than three annual rounds of MDA using ivermectin combined with albendazole. In Abengourou and Akoupé health Districts in eastern Côte d’Ivoire the prevalence and intensity of hookworm infection were evaluated before and after MDA. Prior to MDA and after each annual treatment cycle, study participants were tested for STH using the Kato-Katz technique. The mean MDA compliance assessed during the survey was 65%, and no difference was observed between treatment areas. Compliance results were confirmed by an independent coverage survey as recommended by WHO. Hookworm was the most prevalent STH species in both areas and the prevalence of other STH species was less than 1%. The crude prevalence of hookworm dropped significantly, from 23.9% to 5.5% in the annual and from 12.4% to 1.9% in the semi-annual treatment areas. The intensity of hookworm infection in infected persons decreased significantly in the annual MDA area (406.2 epg to 118.3 epg, p = 0.017), but not in the semi-annual MDA area (804.9 epg to 875.0 epg, p = 0.216). Moderate and heavy infections were reduced to less than 1% in both treatment areas. Three annual and five semi-annual rounds of community-wide MDA with the combination of IVM and ALB showed strong, but similar effects on hookworm prevalence and intensity in eastern Côte d’Ivoire. Therefore, an annual MDA regimen seems to be an efficient strategy for controlling hookworm infection in endemic areas with low and moderate infection prevalence.
