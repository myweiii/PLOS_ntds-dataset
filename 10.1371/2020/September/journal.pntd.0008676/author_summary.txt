The rise in global incidence of DENV and the resulting rise in mortality rate necessitates an effective universal vaccine against it. Since infection from one DENV serotype makes a person vulnerable to severe disease upon infection from another serotype, an effective vaccine should protect against all DENV serotypes. Increasing experimental evidence suggests that T cells are important for protecting against DENV. In this work, we comprehensively analyzed the extensive publicly-available data on DENV and revealed a distinct pattern of epitope conservation for several of the DENV T cell epitopes. Importantly, we identified a set of epitopes that are highly conserved across at least three DENV serotypes. Incorporating information about the HLA alleles associated with these epitopes, we identified a potentially robust set of epitopes as targets for a prospective universal T cell-based vaccine that maximizes global population coverage. By training the immune system to target specific regions of DENV proteins which are likely to protect against multiple serotypes, a T cell-based vaccine might be effective in circumventing progression to severe dengue infection.
