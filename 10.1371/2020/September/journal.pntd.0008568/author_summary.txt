Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a group of organisms that exist as human, animal and plant parasites. T. brucei (a human and animal parasite) has been developed as a model system to study basic biological as well as disease related questions in this group of organisms. We study how the parasite duplicates and divides its mitochondrial genome, an essential component of its energy generating machinery. The structure involved in dividing the mitochondrial genome into the daughter cells during cell division is called the tripartite attachment complex (TAC). The TAC is likely a unique structure not present in the host and thus might provide a new avenue for drug development. In this manuscript, we compare different techniques that allow the identification of novel components of this structure and verify the localisation of some of them. Furthermore, we also establish the interaction of two previously identified protein components.
