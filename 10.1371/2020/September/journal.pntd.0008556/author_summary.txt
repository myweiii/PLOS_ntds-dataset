Ebola virus (EBOV) is established as a sexually transmitted infection, however there is limited information on the sexual behaviors of Ebola survivors. We surveyed a cohort of male Ebola survivors regarding sexual activity and condom use and offered semen testing to assess EBOV persistence in semen. We found that a large majority of men who were sexually active prior to contracting Ebola Virus Disease remained sexually active after their recovery with most reporting only intermittent condom use. Semen testing for the presence of Ebola virus had limited impact on sexual behaviors, with most continuing to report engaging in condomless sex whether EBOV was detected or not. This finding has implications for use of semen testing for outbreak control as well as counseling for Ebola survivors and their partners.
