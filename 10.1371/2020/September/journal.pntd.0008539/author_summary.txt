Liberia was one of the worst countries hit by the 2014–2016 Ebola Virus outbreak (EVD). All hospitals’ isolation capacity in Monrovia was stretched by the spiralling number of EVD cases. As a stop-gap measure, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) distributed household disinfection kit to those who were considered at high risk of EVD transmission, including relatives of confirmed EVD cases, health staff and households in the most affected districts across Monrovia. The purpose of the kit was to care for sick person while waiting for an ambulance or handling dead body while waiting for burial team. The kit contained chlorine and personal protective materials. Health promotion strategy on the purpose and use of the kit was integrated into the distribution. Follow up with the kit recipients was done by phone to better understand the use of the kit. Overall, 65,609 kits were distributed between September and November 2014. Among 1,386 recipients reached by phone, 60 cases of sickness and/or death events occurred in households which received a kit. The majority of these were among the relatives of confirmed EVD cases. Kits’ use was documented in 56 out of 60 affected households. The distribution of household disinfection kits was feasible and kits were appropriately used by the majority of the recipients. In similar circumstances in future, the intervention should be considered.
