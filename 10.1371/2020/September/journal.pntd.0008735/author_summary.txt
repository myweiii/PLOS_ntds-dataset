Blood-sucking bugs are vectors of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes the Chagas disease. Triatoma brasiliensis is the main Chagas disease vector in the Caatinga eco-region of northeastern Brazil. Previous studies have already indicated that this species is associated with rodents of the Caviidae family–mainly in the sylvatic environment. In this study, we showed that these rodents are the main food sources of T. brasiliensis also in peridomestic environments. This association is frequently followed by numerous populations of T. cruzi infected insects in man-made ecotopes to store materials of mineral and wood origin. We suggest that the key-host that drives these infestations are mainly Galea spixii, followed by Kerodon rupestris (both Rodentia: Caviidae), which seem to be in synanthropic processes because they were found as frequent blood meals for T. brasiliensis in the sylvatic and domestic environments. Other mammals–mainly cats–may play an important role in Chagas disease eco-epidemiology for also being an important source of food for triatomines in the sylvatic and peridomestic environments. We conclude that educational programs to avoid Chagas disease transmission should include advising local people to avoid storing wood and tiles/bricks in the peridomestic environment–shelters for key-host rodents. Besides, they must be aware that these cavies may be infected by T. cruzi; and cautions are needed if they are to be used as a source of protein by hunting.
