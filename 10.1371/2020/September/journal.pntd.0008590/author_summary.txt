This study used a plaque-formation screen, as a surrogate for bacterial virulence, to identify a plaque-defective environmental isolate of B. pseudomallei that is impaired in intracellular replication, actin polymerization and MNGC formation in infected cells. Whole genome sequencing and PCR indicated that this phenotype was attributable to genomic loss. A similar event was detected in a K96243 isogenic morphotype in vitro under a laboratory stress condition. In contrast, all isolates from clinical samples induced high plaque-forming efficiency. Our data suggest that further studies are required to identify the distribution of less virulent strains in the environment and the correlation with human melioidosis.
