As the most common human arbovirus infection in Australia, Ross River virus exerts a significant public health and economic burden on the population. Because the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, incidence is influenced by climate, environment, and socio-economic factors. Using epidemiological models to predict incidence or outbreaks of RRV fully utilises these data to inform decision-making. In this systematic review, we summarised models and their predictive performance, and highlighted significant exposures in order to increase understanding of transmission.
