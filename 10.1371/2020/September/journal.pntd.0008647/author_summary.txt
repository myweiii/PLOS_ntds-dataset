Trachoma, an infection of the eye caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis, and many diarrhea-causing infections are associated with access to water for washing hands and faces. Measuring these different pathogens in a population is challenging and rarely are multiple infections measured at the same time. Here, we used an integrated approach to simultaneously measure antibody responses to C. trachomatis, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Vibrio cholerae among young children residing in rural Ethiopia. We found that the seroprevalence of all pathogens increased with age and that seropositivity to more than one pathogen was common. Children living further from a water source were more likely to be exposed to S. enterica and G. intestinalis. Integrated sero-surveillance is a promising avenue to explore the complexities of multi-pathogen exposure as well as to investigate associations between water, sanitation, and hygiene related exposures and disease transmission.
