We thank the PNLTHA (programme National de Lutte contre la Trypanosomiase Africaine) for facilitating the logistics and the access to the field and for that we would like to address a special acknowledgement to Jean-Marie Mwanankesa, the driver. We also deeply thank Ruth Nzuzi and Jean Lumengo for their hard work on the field, accompanying communities in the whole process and for their valuable data collection. Finally, we sincerely thank the Dunda communities for their warm welcome.
