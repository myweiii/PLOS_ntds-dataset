During epidemics of Zika virus disease in the Americas in 2015 and 2016, assessment of transmission dynamics was limited by inconsistent laboratory testing of patients with suspected Zika virus disease. This limitation was further complicated by co-circulation of dengue and chikungunya viruses, which cause illnesses clinically similar to Zika virus disease. In Puerto Rico, all reported suspect cases of arboviral disease were tested for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus infection throughout the epidemic, which allowed for fine-scale analysis of epidemiologic and spatiotemporal trends. In total, 39,717 cases of Zika virus disease were detected, or roughly 1% of all residents of Puerto Rico. Young adults and females were most affected. Disease was mostly mild, as only 1% of cases were hospitalized. Thirteen patients with Zika virus disease died, most of whom had Guillain-Barr√© syndrome or severe underlying illnesses. Early detection of Zika virus disease cases was associated with more populated areas of eastern Puerto Rico, where early detection of peak case numbers also occurred, particularly in warmer areas. These trends suggest that, in contrast to prior epidemics of dengue and chikungunya that started in the San Juan metropolitan region, the Zika virus epidemic appears to have begun in eastern Puerto Rico.
