The authors would like to acknowledge all the veterinarians and animal owners who submitted samples from rabies-suspected animals to the NRL. They would also like to acknowledge all the staff who works in the NRL and at the NRC-R and who contributed to the recording and analysis of samples. We are also grateful to the three anonymous reviewers for their remarks which substantially contributed to improve the manuscript.
