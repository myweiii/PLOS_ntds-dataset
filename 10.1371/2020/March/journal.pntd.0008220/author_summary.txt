The liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis, is endemic in East Asian countries. People get infected through consumption of raw freshwater fish carrying C. sinensis metacercaria, an infective form to human. The metacercaria excysts in the human duodenum and the juvenile fluke migrates into the intrahepatic bile duct following chemical cues provided by bile. The juvenile fluke matures in the intrahepatic bile duct, and the adult fluke causes inflammatory injuries to the bile duct, which can eventually lead to bile duct cancer. Bile plays a critical role in the flukeâ€™s life in the human host. In this study, we demonstrated that the adult C. sinensis fluke was attracted by bile and bile acids, such as cholic acid and deoxycholic acid, but repelled by lithocholic acid. The chemotactic attraction of the fluke to cholic acid was suppressed by experimental dopaminergic antagonists. Clinically used antipsychotic drugs that are dopaminergic antagonists, namely chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and clozapine, also strongly suppressed the chemotaxis. While the drugs elicited a minor response of fluke expulsion from the bile ducts of infected rabbits, they significantly reduced egg production. The results could be utilized to develop effective drugs to treat C. sinensis infection.
