Cryptosporidium is a major cause of diarrheal disease in humans globally. Due to the lack of effective drug treatment and vaccine prevention against cryptosporidiosis, it is particularly important to develop efficient control strategies to intervene with and prevent Cryptosporidium infection in humans. The present review presented and analyzed epidemiological status and characteristics of Cryptosporidium infection in humans in China since the first report in 1987. To date, epidemiological investigations of Cryptosporidium infecion have been carried out in different populations in 27 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Average prevalence of Cryptosporidium was 2.97% (5,933/200,054). Like other infectious disease, due to poor sanitation conditions in rural areas, people living in rural areas had a significantly higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium (1.77–12.87%) than those living in urban areas (0–3.70%). Seven Cryptosporidium species were identified, including C. hominis, C. andersoni, C. parvum, C. meleagridis, C. felis, C. canis and C. suis. This retrospective epidemiological analysis indicates wide geographical distribution of human Cryptosporidium infection/cryptosporidiosis in China.
