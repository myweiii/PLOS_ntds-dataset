Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is becoming an emerging threat in non-endemic countries and establishing new foci in endemic countries. The treatment available has not changed significantly in over 40 years. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a greater understanding of parasite biology and disease pathogenesis to identify new therapeutic targets and to maximise the efficient use of existing drugs. We have used genetically modified strains of T. cruzi carrying a bioluminescence/fluorescence dual reporter fusion gene to monitor parasite replication in vivo during both acute and chronic infections in a mouse model. Utilising TUNEL assays for mitochondrial DNA replication and EdU incorporation for total DNA replication, we have found that parasite division within infected cells is asynchronous in all phases of infection. Differentiation also appears to be uncoordinated, with replicating amastigotes co-existing with non-dividing trypomastigotes in the same host cell.
