Mosquito-borne pathogens include flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, which continue to cause disease worldwide. Some of these flaviviruses have only recently emerged as major human pathogens, despite having been discovered decades ago. Determining the mechanisms of host-restriction of viruses with cryptic ecological niches will help us to understand how new viral diseases may emerge. In this study, we investigated the host-restriction of a recently discovered flavivirus, Bamaga virus. We demonstrated that the virus host-restriction observed in vertebrate cells only occurs at 37Â°C, and that the virus can replicate efficiently at lower temperatures. We identified three amino acid substitutions located at two viral protease cleavage sites, which we have demonstrated are directly involved in BgV host-restriction in vitro and attenuation in vivo. Overall, our data provide new insight into mechanisms flavivirus attenuation and host-restriction in vertebrates.
