The authors thank all of the families and communities at the study sites for allowing us to conduct this work around their homes. We are particularly grateful for the contributions of the MRC Gambia fieldworkers Pateh Makalo, Kemo Ceesay and Dembo Camara, without whose hard work, dedication and ingenuity this study would not have been possible, and for the assistance of Keol Debele, the entomology fieldworker in Oromia. We are also grateful for the assistance from Aida Abashawl in project co-ordination, Nazif Jemal in communications, and Munira Haji Mohammed Yusuf, Helen W/Semayat, and Demitu Legesse in translation in the Oromian work.
