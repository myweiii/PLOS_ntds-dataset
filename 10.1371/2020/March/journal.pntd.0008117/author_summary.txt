Because of its implications for awareness, surveillance and risk assessment of EBOV transmission to humans, the origin of emerging Zaire ebolavirus is investigated at each outbreak. To reliably do so requires a good understanding of the circulation dynamics of Zaire ebolavirus in its reservoir, which has yet to be determined. Here, we analyzed available full-length Zaire ebolavirus genomes from past and current outbreaks to infer the between-outbreak circulation dynamics while avoiding model misspecification by downsampling the data.
