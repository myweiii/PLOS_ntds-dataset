The uncontrolled spreading of cyanobacteria in drinking water reservoirs has been the cause of serious public health problems worldwide. Toxin-producing cyanobacterial blooms commonly occur during drought periods in the northeast (NE) region of Brazil. During Zika Virus (ZIKV) outbreak in 2015–16, Brazilian NE showed disproportionately higher microcephaly incidence. Here, we test the hypothesis that the cyanotoxin saxitoxin (STX) may act as a co-insult for ZIKV. Water quality surveillance data showed increased cyanobacteria population and higher STX amount in NE region during 2014–2018. In vitro, we observed that neural progenitor cell death was doubled after STX exposure to ZIKV-infected brain organoids. In vivo, chronic ingestion of STX during gestational period potentiated ZIKV-derived brain abnormalities in newborn mice. Our study provides new insights that may explain the discrepancies among Brazilian regions regarding CZS severity. Moreover, the data highlight the importance of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin freshwater monitoring for future arbovirus outbreaks.
