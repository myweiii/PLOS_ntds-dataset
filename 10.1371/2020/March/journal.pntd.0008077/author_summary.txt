Leishmania (L.) infantum is responsible for both visceral leishmaniasis and sporadic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Tunisia. The isoenzymatic typing of this taxon revealed three zymodemes and only one (L. infantum MON-1) presents the transmission cycle elucidated. In this study, we conducted an entomological survey using CDC light traps in central Tunisia wherein the three zymodemes of L. infantum coexist, to investigate the presence of L. infantum, to quantify the parasite load, and to analyze the blood meal sources in infected sand flies belonging to Larroussius (Lar.) subgenus. Our results demonstrate the role of Ph. Lar. species in L. infantum transmission and their potential role in L. major and L. killicki life cycles. The high parasite load observed in Ph. perfiliewi underline its incrimination in L. infantum transmission. Also, blood meal analysis showed that Lar. subgenus sand flies fed on cattle, goat, sheep, chicken, and human. Thus, in the light of the present results, further studies should be performed for a better understanding of L. infantum transmission cycles.
