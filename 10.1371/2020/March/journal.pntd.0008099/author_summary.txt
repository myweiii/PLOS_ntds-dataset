Dengue virus (DENV) is an emerging mosquito-borne global health threat in the tropics and subtropics. The majority of the world’s population live in areas at risk of dengue that can cause a wide variety of symptoms from febrile illness to haemorrhagic fever. Information of DENV in Africa is limited and fragmented. In Kenya, dengue is a recognized disease in coastal cities that have experienced recent outbreaks. We investigated the role of DENV infection as a cause of acute febrile disease in non-epidemic settings in rural and urban study areas in Kenya. We found DENV-2 in five febrile patients from rural Taita–Taveta, where no dengue has been reported before. Genetic analysis of the virus suggests it to be most likely of Indian origin. This Indian origin DENV-2 was detected in the Mombasa outbreak in 2013, in Kilifi in 2014, in Taita–Taveta in 2016 (our study samples) and again in the Malindi outbreak in 2017. The results suggest that dengue is unrecognized in rural Kenya and more studies are needed for local risk assessment. Our findings of virus transmission between epidemics contribute to better understanding of the epidemiological situation and origins of DENV in Kenya.
