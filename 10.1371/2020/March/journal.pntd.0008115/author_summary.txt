Schistosomes are formidable parasites that cause the debilitating and life-threatening disease human schistosomiasis. We need to better understand the cellular biology of these parasites to develop novel strategies for their control. Within cells, a process called protein phosphorylation controls many aspects of molecular communication or ‘signalling’ and is central to cellular function and homeostasis. Here, using complementary strategies, we have performed the first in-depth characterisation and functional annotation of protein phosphorylation events in schistosomes, providing one of the richest phosphoprotein resources for any parasite to date. Using this knowledge, we have developed a novel tool to simultaneously evaluate signalling processes in these worms and highlight sex-biased differences in adult worm protein phosphorylation. Several proteins were found to be more greatly phosphorylated by female worm extracts, suggesting their possible importance to female worm function. This work will help drive new research into the fundamental biology of schistosomes, as well as related parasites, and will support efforts to develop new drug or vaccine-based therapeutics for their control.
