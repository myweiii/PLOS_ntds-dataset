Clonorchiasis is an important food-borne parasitic disease. People get infected mainly through eating raw and infected fish, thus different behaviors of raw-fish-consumption play an important role on transmission. Itâ€™s critical to find effective and sustainable control strategies for morbidity control of the disease. Control programmes have been implemented in endemic areas mostly in short periods, which is difficult to assess their long-term benefits and sustainability. We developed a multi-group model depicting transmission dynamics of the disease among different groups of people with different raw-fish-consumption behaviors, based on which, long-term effects of possible control strategies were simulated and assessed. Under a typical transmission setting, we found that combinations of control measures were much beneficial than those singly applied; higher coverages of measures had better effects; and strategies targeted on whole population performed better than that on at-risk population with raw-fish-consumption behaviors. The strategy recommended by the government of Guangdong Province, China shows good and sustainable effects. Besides, several sustainable strategies are provided under the study setting. The proposed transmission model is easily facilitated with other transmission settings. The simulation outputs can be considered together with actual practical situations to support decision making on selection of effective control strategies on clonorchiasis.
