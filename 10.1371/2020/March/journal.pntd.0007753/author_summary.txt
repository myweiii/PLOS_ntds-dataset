The author is interested in the evolution of genes that confer resistance to insecticides, especially when this evolution affects the binding of insecticides to their target sites. The Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel gene provides an excellent opportunity to understand how mutations at the target site(s) affect the evolution of resistance in many different pest insect species, including Aedes aegypti, which is the primary vector of the dengue, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya viruses.
