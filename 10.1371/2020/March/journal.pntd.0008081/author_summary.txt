We describe the genetic diversity distribution in Africa of the pathogen Mycobacterium bovis, the responsible for bovine tuberculosis, mostly present in cattle but also transmittable to other animals including humans. This diversity is geographically clustered within the African continent meaning that the genetic diversity was established through independent evolution within different areas. Higher diversity values of M. bovis are found in Eastern and Northern Africa, followed by Central Africa, with Western and Southern Africa displaying the lowest diversity. These levels of diversity correlate well with the introduction of domesticated livestock in the different regions of Africa, following their domestication in the Near East 10,000 ago. We hypothesize that M. bovis emerged in the Near East and it was carried across Africa together with domesticated animals and people that developed herding practices and biological tolerance for digesting milk in adulthood. Such scenario implies a strong evolution and co-evolution of M. bovis across Africa leading to locally adapted strains that could prove a challenge for public health actions.
