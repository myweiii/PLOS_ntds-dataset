One of the major gaps in Leishmania research is the lack of stage-specific markers to differentiate the Leishmania promastigote stages in the sand fly vector as well as in culture. In this study, we report the transcriptional boundaries amongst Leishmania infantum promastigote stages developing in the sand fly vector Lutzomyia longipalpis. Despite the policystronic nature of Leishmania mRNAs, we were able to detect 10- to 100 fold differences in transcriptional abundance between genes throught RNA sequencing. Significant number of genes were differentially expressed between subsequent stages, showing enrichment of stage specific up-regulated genes even across chromosomes. In light of such differences, we identified potential stage-specific markers for each promastigote stage of Leishmania with potential use in epidemiological studies as well as in further characterization the developmental differences amongst the promastigote stages in the vector.
