Tropical viruses transmitted by ticks or mosquitoes are becoming a health threat in areas of the world that were previously na√Øve to these infections. Usutu virus is a mosquito-borne virus that is circulating in Europe causing massive outbreaks in birds. Transmission to humans is documented, with some reports of severe neurological disease. However, the real size of transmission to humans suffers from lack of data due to insufficient surveillance. The first confirmed case of human USUV infection in an asymptomatic blood donor from North-Eastern Italy is hereby demonstrated by molecular assays and virus isolation. Specific Usutu virus serology has also been developed taking advantage of the NS1 viral antigen, which is tested on a number of blood donors demonstrating a high level of Usutu positivity. These findings confirm the human transmission in the region and offer a novel tool for specific Usutu virus surveillance. Finally, two drugs that were previously shown to have a wide spectrum of activity towards members of this family of viruses are shown to inhibit also Usutu virus, opening the way to a novel class antivirals.
