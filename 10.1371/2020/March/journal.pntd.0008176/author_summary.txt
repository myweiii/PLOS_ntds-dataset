The role of water treatment in integrated interventions, alongside preventive chemotherapy and behavior change programs, is growing, as we now look towards elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health concern. So far, no guidelines have been developed for treating schistosome infested water. This is partially due to the lack of appropriate methods for measuring cercarial viability, which has impeded the research into the effectiveness of water treatment processes against schistosome cercariae. This study develops and validates two dual-staining, high-throughput fluorescence assays for quantifying cercarial viability in water samples. These methods will facilitate the testing of water treatment processes against cercariae, thereby bringing the knowledge of water treatment for schistosomiasis up to speed with the level of our knowledge of how to control other waterborne and water-based diseases. This will promote the development of water treatment guidelines and the design of effective water infrastructure for schistosomiasis-endemic regions.
