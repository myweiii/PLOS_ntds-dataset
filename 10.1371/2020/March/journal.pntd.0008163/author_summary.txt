Zika virus (ZIKV), isolated for the first time in Uganda in 1947, is transmitted to human beings mainly by the bite of an infected mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes genus notably Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Both Aedes species are present in Central Africa, however their epidemiological role is poorly characterized. Here, we assessed the ability of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus collected in different ecological settings in Central Africa to transmit a ZIKV strain isolated in West Africa. Analysis showed that both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are able to transmit ZIKV but with higher overall transmission efficiency for Ae. aegypti compared to Ae. albopictus. In addition, disseminated infection and transmission rates for both Aedes species varied significantly according to the sampling location. Overall, our result suggests that in Central Africa, Ae. aegypti is more competent to transmit ZIKV than Ae. albopictus although parameters such as the feeding behaviour, longevity and mosquito densities can modulate pathogens transmission in nature. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiological transmission of ZIKV in Central Africa and develop suitable strategy to prevent major ZIKV outbreaks in this region.
