ZIKV represents a serious threat to global health with particular relevance to microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in newborns, and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, meningoencephalitis, multi-organ failure in adults. Despite the global health threat of Zika virus infection, there is currently no vaccine or effective antiviral therapy available for the disease. As widely recognized, interferon signaling is key to establishing a strong antiviral state in host cells, mainly mediated through the anti-viral effects of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). This work described our novel finding of the antiviral effect of a novel ISG, C19orf66, and its underlying mechanisms. We identified C19orf66 as a novel ISG that exerts antiviral effects against ZIKV by specifically interacting and colocalizing with the ZIKV nonstructural (NS) protein NS3, which inducing NS3 degradation via a lysosome-dependent pathway. Thus, this work broadens the understanding of the pivotal roles of C19orf66 in the interaction between the host and ZIKV, which might further provide a rational basis for developing novel anti-ZIKV strategies.
