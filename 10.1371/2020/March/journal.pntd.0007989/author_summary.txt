Oral cholera vaccines (OCV) are now on the WHO stockpile and targeted for use for countries with outbreaks and epidemics but also for control of endemic cholera. In Bangladesh many studies have been carried out to assess the safety, immunogenicity as well as feasibility of vaccination in the endemic settings of the country. However, with the large recent influx of displaced Rohingya nationals from Myanmar (termed Forcibly Displace Myanmar National; FDMN), mass campaigns with OCV were conducted between October 2017-December 2018. However, no data is available of the previous exposure to cholera of this population, prior to their arrival in Bangladesh. An assessment of immunogenicity status of FDMN is needed to find out if OCV is able to elicit comparable immune response and whether the same dose regimen of OCV was immunogenic among the FDMNs. In this study, we have measured the immune responses to the OCV, Shanchol, in adults (18 years and above), older children (6–17 years), and younger children (1–5 years). The results of this study shows that the oral cholera vaccine capable of inducing an immune response in adults and children among this FDMN population and the responses were comparable to that seen in Bangladeshi participants in earlier studies.
