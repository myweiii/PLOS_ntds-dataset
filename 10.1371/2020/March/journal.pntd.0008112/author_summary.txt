Mosquitoes carry many globally important human pathogens including a family of related viruses: dengue virus, West Nile virus, Yellow Fever virus, and recently of critical significance, Zika virus. The Zika virus epidemic emerged very rapidly in the susceptible South American population and in many cases immune responses were unable to control the infection. Immune history is a key element of susceptibility or resistance to severe disease. We examined whether pre-existing infection would skew or divert immune resources and might play a role in the severity of Zika infection in the Americas. Using samples from dengue patients and healthy controls from India, we tested functional responses to Zika virus in the context of pre-existing dengue infection. We quantified frequency and functional status of 36 individual cell subsets in depth using advanced profiling techniques and a novel deep learning algorithm. We showed an intact response to new infection with Zika virus which was enriched for early innate immune pathways and robust even during existing dengue infection. Thus, our study suggests that concurrent dengue infection would not be expected to impair immune responses to new infection with Zika virus.
