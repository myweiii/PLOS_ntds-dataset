Typhoid fever is an infectious and life-threatening disease in developing countries. Before 2017, Ty21a and Vi polysaccharide vaccines were licensed but these are not recommended in young children under 2-year-old. Vaccine manufacturers are developing typhoid Vi conjugate vaccines (TCVs) to improve immunogenicity. Typbar-TCV (Vi-TT) demonstrated its safety and immunogenicity in infants and recently, prequalified by WHO. Serum Vi-specific IgG antibody has been used to measure the immunogenicity of TCV in many clinical trials. However, due to lack of harmonized assay, comparison of the immunogenicity among various TCVs is not possible in the absence of head-to-head clinical trials. Recently, we evaluated immunogenicity of Vi-DT using an in-house ELISA in the clinical study. In this study, 48 sera were selected from Vi-DT phase 1 study and measured anti-Vi IgG using commercial Vacczyme ELISA kit, used in the phase 3 study of Vi-TT, to compare the immunogenicity between two vaccines. Based on the correlation between two assays, anti-Vi IgG of all participants in the Vi-DT study was converted to Vacczyme antibody value using statistical model and compared with results of Vi-TT phase 3 study. The antibody levels induced by two studies were similar in pre- and post-vaccinated sera. This approach enables to compare the antibody responses among TCVs under development and would facilitate licensing of new TCVs.
