In 1978, dengue fever was first reported in Guangdong province, China, and this has been continuously prevalent in Guangdong in recent years. This is responsible for the heavy burden on the control of dengue, and raises the concern about whether dengue outbreaks have become endemic in Guangdong. Previous studies based on single E gene or few full-length genome sequences were inconclusive. In this study, we sequenced 114 DENV complete genomes of DENV1-4 obtained from 2013 to 2017 in Guangdong and further analyzed the epidemiological and molecular characteristics. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that dengue fever was not endemic in Guangdong, which was indirectly supported by results of our recombination analyses. Nucleotide variation analyses indicated that purification selection shaped dengue virus population. Our investigation will facilitate the development of more effective epidemiological surveillance strategies for dengue infection.
