Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is endemic in 72 countries of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. It causes painful, disabling hydrocele in an estimated 25 million men. Hydrocele leads to reduced mobility, social exclusion, and depression, all of which limit the menâ€™s ability to work. Filarial hydrocele can be corrected with surgery with few complications. We measured the economic loss due to hydrocele and the benefits of hydrocelectomy in two districts in southern Malawi. We calculated lost earnings over the lifetime due to filarial hydrocele and compared it to the costs of surgery to determine the benefit-cost ratio. The ratio of the benefit of surgery to its cost is US$1684/US$68 or 24.8. The results are robust to variations in cost of surgery and length of working life. Scaling up subsidies to hydrocelectomy campaigns should be a priority for governments and international aid organizations to prevent and alleviate disability and lost earnings that aggravate poverty among the many millions of men with filarial hydrocele, their families, and their communities.
