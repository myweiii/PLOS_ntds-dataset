Several studies have shown that leprosy, podoconiosis and lymphatic filariasis impact individual quality of life. In contrast, family quality of life has not received as much attention despite evidence that families are also affected. This is especially relevant given the crucial role of the family in most societies around the world. This study looked at the impact of leprosy, podoconiosis and lymphatic filariasis on family quality of life in Northwest Ethiopia. The study used a cross-sectional design with a qualitative approach. Both semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with persons affected and their family members. A total of 86 participants were included in this study: 56 participants in the in-depth interviews and 30 participants in the focus group discussions. This study revealed that leprosy, lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis have an effect on family quality of life, resulting in: participation restrictions, reduced productivity, marginalisation, discrimination, divorce, difficulties finding a spouse, school dropouts, mental health problems and poverty. Both persons affected and their family members were impacted. Many problems reported related to impairments, stigma and poverty. The results of this study can be used to inform leprosy, lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis treatment and after care programmes.
