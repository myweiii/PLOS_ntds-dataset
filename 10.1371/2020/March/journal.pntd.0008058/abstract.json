    "Background": "Lymphoedema caused by lymphatic filariasis (LF) or podoconiosis can result in physical disability and social exclusion, which is exacerbated by painful acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA) episodes. These conditions have a significant impact on patients, however, little is known about the indirect effects on their caregivers. This study, therefore, aimed to determine the impact on caregivers for patients with leg lymphoedema in a co-endemic district of Ethiopia.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "A cross-sectional survey of lymphoedema patients and their caregivers was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires in the Southern Nation Nationalities Peoples Region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia. Lymphoedema patient information on clinical severity (mild, moderate, severe), frequency of ADLAs, their socio-demographic characteristics and the identity of main caregiver(s) was collected. Caregiver information on socio-demographic characteristics, types of care provided, their quality of life (QoL) measured across nine domains, and productivity was collected, with key indicators compared in the presence and absence of patients\u2019 ADLAs.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "Lymphoedema and ADLAs impact negatively on patients\u2019 and their caregivers\u2019 lives. This emphasises the importance of increasing access to effective morbidity management and disability prevention services to reduce the burden and help to address the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, target 5.4, which seeks to recognise and value unpaid care and domestic work."
