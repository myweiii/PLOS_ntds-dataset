Lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis can result in chronic severe lymphoedema of the limbs, which is aggravated by frequent painful episodes of acute bacterial infection known as ‘acute attacks’. The debilitating impact of these conditions on patients are well documented, however, the extent to which the hardship extends to their caregivers is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, a survey of 73 lymphoedema patients and their caregivers was conducted in an endemic region of Ethiopia. Patients were found to be predominately female and caregivers predominately male, mostly spouses. Caregivers provided a wide range of care, and the type, frequency and time spent on tasks significantly increased when patients experienced an acute attack. Caregivers reported a negative impact on their quality of life and provided care for an average of 15 days and forfeited an average of 7 days of work or school per month. This study has revealed a previously hidden burden of lymphoedema that not only affects patients, but their caregivers who are mostly family members. This emphasises the importance of increasing access to effective morbidity management and disability prevention programmes to reduce the burden and help to address the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, target 5.4, which seeks to recognise and value unpaid and domestic work.
