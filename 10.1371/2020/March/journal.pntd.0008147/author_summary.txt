Echinococcosis is a severe chronic parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. According to the World Health Organization, there are more than 1 million people living with echinococcosis worldwide. For decades, little progress has been made to develop a molecular diagnosis and specific treatment for the disease. Although imaging and immunological detection are used for diagnosis, these technologies are either only effective for late stages of the disease or hardly conclusive. The detection of cell-free DNA has been a powerful tool for precise diagnosis. In this study, we showed the presence of Echinococcus-derived cell-free DNA in plasma of echinococcosis patients. We further established an assay to detect parasite DNA in blood samples based on amplification of Echinococcus specific repeat regions followed by targeted next-generation sequencing. This technique provides a new method for potential extensive screening and precision diagnosis of echinococcosis with high specificity.
