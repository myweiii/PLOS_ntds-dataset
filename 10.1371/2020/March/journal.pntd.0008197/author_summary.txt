Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. To date, the genus Leptospira contains 64 species isolated from human, animals and environments. Identification of Leptospira species causing human leptospirosis is important to decipher the epidemiology and transmission pattern of this disease. In our study, we identified Leptospira interrogans, Leptospira kirschneri, and Leptospira wolffii as the human-infecting Leptospira species in Malaysia. These three species have been isolated from rodents and environment in Malaysia earlier, however, these novel isolates are genotypically distinct. The identification of novel clinically important Leptospira interrogans strains in the present study underscores the importance of characterizing more human-infecting strains and search for the potential animal reservoirs.
