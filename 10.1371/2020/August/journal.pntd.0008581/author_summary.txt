Snakebite envenomation is an important public health problem recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a neglected tropical disease affecting about 2 million of poor people of the tropical world. The most effective therapy is the timely administration of efficacious antivenoms which are usually produced in horses. The serum/plasma of horse immunized with snake venoms is purified and tested for its efficacies in neutralizing the target venoms. The neutralization is assayed using mice injected with the venom together with the antivenom. This assay requires about 60 mice for each pair of venom and antivenom. The assay is expensive, laborious, giving highly variable results and is objected on ethical and religious grounds. The present study involves the development of an in vitro assay involving the binding of a snake neurotoxin to a soluble receptor protein called nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. It is shown here that this receptor binding assay gave good correlation with the assay using mice. The test tube assay is simpler, faster, cheaper and less variable when compared with the mouse assay and thus could reduce or even replace the use of life animal. Furthermore, it could expedite the development of effective antivenoms against various venomous snakes in many parts of the world.
