This population-based cohort study is the first one conducted in the Old World which compares the incidence of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) to the temporal dynamics of LST in two foci contrasting in their past history for L major transmission. Our results demonstrate that people living in an old CL focus with intense and sustained exposure to L major, develop long-lasting immunity against the parasite resulting in protection against overt disease; This feature markedly differs from that observed in more recent CL focus where overt CL occurs regardless of LST status. Our study highlights that although LST is a useful epidemiological tool for monitoring leishmania transmission rate over time, its use as a surrogate marker of protection against recurrence of CL or as an inclusion criterion in vaccine trials, calls caution. Moreover, the intensity and past history of Leishmania transmission in the study site should be anticipated as important confounders of the outcome of infection and should be carefully addressed in the design of anti-Leishmania vaccine trials.
