Perception of mass drug administration (MDA) programs for helminth control by the affected populations influences compliance and therefore affects the success of the program. We determined the perception of the impact of Zimbabweâ€™s National Helminth Control Program with a specific focus on schistosomiasis in the school children treated with praziquantel and the opinion of schoolteachers and village health workers (VHW). Overall, 84% of the children responded that their awareness of schistosomiasis had improved because of participating in the MDAs. Of the children self-diagnosed with schistosomiasis, over 90% reported that their health had improved following treatment with praziquantel. This included resolution of self identified health symptoms including haematuria, painful urination, sore stomach, tiredness and falling asleep during class lessons, although the latter two were less frequent before treatment. The children and teachers reported improvements in both pupil school attendance and performance at school as well as increased health-seeking behaviour for schistosomiasis treatment in-between MDAs. Finally, > 90% of the VHW reported improvement in handwashing behaviour, schistosomiasis awareness and treatment uptake within the community. However, only 59% of the VHW reported improvement in toilet use while only 50% of the VHW reported improvement in clean water use, within their communities, highlighting the need for improved safe water and sanitation provision.
