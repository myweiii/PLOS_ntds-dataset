The Neglected Tropical Disease, loiasis (tropical eye worm disease) affects 13â€“15 million individuals in Central Africa. Loiasis has recently been identified as a cause of premature mortality and is a barrier to ivermectin-based elimination of onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis where co-infections occur, due to the risk of serious adverse events. Loiasis lacks laboratory preclinical models for drug development, biomarker discovery and inflammatory pathology research. Here we detail the successful development of an experimental technique for the laboratory production of Loa loa infective larvae via injection of purified microfilariae into the thorax of wild-caught tabanid flies that are the natural transmission vector. The high yielding infective larvae produced in the laboratory were validated as biologically viable in culture and in a new mouse infection model whereby adult-stage parasites could be produced. The evidence reported herein is an important step to establishing a full laboratory life cycle of L. loa by passage between animal models and experimental injections of the wild-caught vector, Chrysops.
