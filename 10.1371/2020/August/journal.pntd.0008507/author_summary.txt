Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is vector-born intracellular protozoan infection of human. It is the most common form of leishmaniasis. Cutaneous leishmaniasis imposes a major public health problem to human being. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical presentation like nodular, Papular, nodulo-Papular, diffuse induration, nodulo-ulcerative and indurated plaque. Its clinical manifestation usually begins with an erythematous papule seen at the site of inoculation, then papule enlarges and breaks, forming a painless ulcer with a well-demarcated raised border with different centimeters in diameter, finally this will end up with depressed scar after healing. The lesions usually occur in the face and exposed extremities. Even though CL is not fatal, it can lead to disfigurement and lifelong scar leading to social exclusion and stigmatization. The number of cases and epidemiological foci of CL in Ethiopia is increasing. Here we confirm endemicity of CL in Kutaber district. We also showed as CL is associated with the presence of hyrax, working in and near to farm land and the existence of CL lesion in the neighbor.
