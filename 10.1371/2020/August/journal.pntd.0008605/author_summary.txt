West Bengal has been battling against several mosquito borne diseases such as Malaria, Dengue and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) in recent years. In our study, mosquito larval density of three mosquito species (An. stephensi, A. albopictus and C.vishnui) was measured in the years 2017 and 2018, where most of the mosquito- borne disease cases were reported in West Bengal. Correlation of larval density of three mosquito species with habitat water factors (pH, Hardness, Dissolved Oxygen, Ammonia nitrogen etc.) was determined. Inter- correlation of three different mosquito species was also analyzed. The results demonstrate mosquito larval density of each species were correlated negatively or positively with different water factors and their occurrence lies in between specific range of different water factors. Mosquitoes exhibited negative inter- correlation with each other. Larval density was found to be increased in most of the spots in 2nd sampling year. We may interpret that, increased pollution of water during the year, which changes water quality, is a positive enhancer of mosquito population. Therefore, determining water quality parameters are most important to design the mosquito eradication program in target areas.
