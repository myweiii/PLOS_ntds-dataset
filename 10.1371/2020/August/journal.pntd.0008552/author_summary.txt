In the present study, we characterised the complete mitochondrial genome of Clonorchis sinensis—a carcinogenic liver fluke. To do this, we sequenced from total genomic DNA from multiple adult worms using a new method (Oxford Nanopore technology) to obtain data for long stretches of DNA, and then assembled these data to construct a mitochondrial genome of 18,304 bp, containing a > 4.5 kb-long tandem-repetitive region—not previously detected in this species. The results demonstrate that this method is effective at sequencing long and complex non-coding elements—not achievable using conventional techniques. The discovery of this long tandem-repetitive region in C. sinensis provides an opportunity to now explore its origin(s) and length/sequence diversity in populations of this species, and also to characterise its function(s). The technological approach employed here should have broad applicability to characterise previously-elusive non-coding mitochondrial genomic regions in a wide range of taxa.
