Shigella is the second leading cause of diarrhea morbidity and mortality among children in low and middle-income countries. We characterized the epidemiology of Shigella using highly sensitive diagnostic methods in 41,405 diarrheal and monthly non-diarrheal stools from the first two years of life in a multisite birth cohort. The prevalence of Shigella varied from 4.9%-17.8% across sites, and the incidence of Shigella-attributable diarrhea was 31.8 cases (95% CI: 29.6, 34.2) per 100 child-years. Shigella diarrhea episodes were more likely to be severe and less likely to be culture positive in younger children. Older age, unimproved sanitation, low maternal education, initiating complementary foods before 3 months, and malnutrition were risk factors for Shigella. There was a linear dose-response between Shigella quantity and myeloperoxidase, a marker of intestinal inflammation, which suggests a potential mechanism for the impact of Shigella on child growth. Because culture missed most clinically relevant cases of severe diarrhea and dysentery, molecular diagnostics may be important tools in upcoming Shigella vaccine trials.
