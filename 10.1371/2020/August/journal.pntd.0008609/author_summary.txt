Schistosoma japonicum is a major causative agent of human schistosomiasis. Unlike other parasitic worms, S. japonicum females are determined by the heterogametic sex chromosome (ZW) and males by the homogametic sex chromosome (ZZ). The life cycle of S. japonicum includes the egg, miracidium, mother sporocyst, daughter sporocyst, cercaria, schistosomulum, and adult stages. The sex of adult male and female worms can be morphologically distinguished, whereas the sex of larvae, such as cercariae, can only be discriminated by molecular methods. In this study, we established an efficient duplex real-time PCR method for sexing S. japonicum cercariae based on newly identified W chromosome-specific genes. The established duplex real-time PCR method will facilitate construction of sex-controlled schistosome-infected intermediate host or definitive host models for schistosome-host interplays and schistosomiasis studies. This method is also a powerful tool for investigating the epidemiology of single-sex and mixed-sex schistosome-infected snails in the field.
