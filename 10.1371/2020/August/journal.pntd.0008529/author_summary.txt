Chagas disease is a major public health problem that requires, among other control interventions, an optimal trypanocidal therapy that achieves the best possible compliance to cure active infection, mainly in children and young populations, women before they become pregnant to prevent congenital transmission, and chronic populations who are currently not being treated and with a risk of progression to cardiomyopathy. Some studies suggest that a simple fixed-dose scheme of benznidazole could be equivalent to the dose adjusted by weight for the treatment of adults seropositive to T. cruzi without clinically evident chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. To confirm or reject this potential equivalence of schemes, we conducted a rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by reviewing and analyzing the totality of available literature on the subject. Although we did not find direct evidence addressing this question, it appears that an adjusted dose is probably equivalent in terms of important safety and efficacy outcomes, while the effect on critical outcomes is uncertain. Since we did not find any ongoing study comparing fixed versus adjusted doses of benznidazole, we are conducting an individual patient data network meta-analysis to address this question.
