The aim of this study was to evaluate a kit prototype (T. cruzi Loopamp or Tc LAMP) based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for molecular diagnosis of acute Chagas disease in well-characterized individuals, collected in real life conditions, such as newborns or infants born to Chagas disease mothers aiming to detect congenital Chagas disease, recipients of organs from Chagas disease donors who acquired T. cruzi infection after transplantation, persons with oral Chagas disease acquired after consumption of a contaminated meal, and HIV/T. cruzi coinfected patients at risk of Chagas disease reactivation due to immunosuppression. Different types of clinical samples were tested; peripheral blood samples treated with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagulant or with guanidine hydrochloride or DNAgard stabilizer agents, as well as dried blood spots and cerebrospinal fluid samples. The performance of Tc LAMP was estimated using the case definition in the different groups as a reference and all test kit results were compared to those obtained using standardized duplex real-time PCR (qPCR) in the same clinical samples. Sensitivity and specificity of Tc LAMP in blood samples from the pooled clinical groups were 93% (95% CI: 77–99) and 100% (95% CI: 80–100) respectively. The agreement between Tc LAMP and qPCR was almost perfect (κ index of Cohen = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.62–1.00). Tc LAMP was sensitive and specific for detection of T. cruzi infection in the tested samples, encouraging prospective field studies to validate its use for rapid detection of T. cruzi infection in congenital, acute and CD reactivation due to HIV infection.
