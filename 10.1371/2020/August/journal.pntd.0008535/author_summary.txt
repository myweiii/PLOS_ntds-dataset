Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne virus, and a major cause of fever, with an estimated 390 million infections annually. Guatemala, in Central America, has had ongoing dengue transmission since the 1990s. Its national surveillance system monitors outbreaks and seasonal trends of infections to inform public health responses. We have analysed 17 years of surveillance data collected from 2000 to 2016, to describe seasonal trends, outbreak years, and the fluctuating prevalence of the four dengue serotypes. Laboratory data from 91,554 individual serum samples were included, of which 7.8% were positive for dengue. All four dengue serotypes circulate in the country, with dengue 1 and 2 being the predominant serotypes. This is important, as it increases the likelihood of dengue infections being followed by a new infection with a different serotype, which can lead to severe dengue. We also report that adults in Guatemala have a lower likelihood of infection the year after an epidemic, which might be linked to an increased immunity in the population.
