Schistosomiasis affects more than 229 million people in 78 countries of the world. The main treatment is Mass Drug Administration with praziquantel. With donations to the World Health Organization, approximately 250 million tablets of praziquantel are being administered in sub-Saharan Africa where about 90% of the cases of schistosomiasis occur. The concern with a monotherapy is the development of drug resistance. The need for new drugs with a different mode of action to be used in combination with praziquantel is great. In this regard, we have taken oxamniquine, a drug that was previously used to treat Schistosoma mansoni but was ineffective against S. haematobium and S. japonicum, and determined the enzyme responsible for activation of oxamniquine as a sulfotransferase. With this knowledge and the sulfotransferase crystal structure, we were able to determine the mode of action of the drug and develop an iterative approach of soaking oxamniquine derivatives into sulfotransferase crystals, determining structure function relationships, synthesizing new derivatives and testing them in an in vitro killing assay. The most effective derivatives are soaked into new crystals and the process repeated. We have identified two derivatives, CIDD-0072229 and CIDD-149830 that will kill S. haematobium and S. japonicum in addition to S. mansoni. CIDD-149830 will kill 100% of the worms of all three species within 7 days.
