Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) continues to challenge Asia with pandemic potential. Synthesizing epidemiological data remains essential to inform the development of appropriate interventions. We report the results of a comprehensive hospital-based study conducted in southern Vietnam during 2015–2018. A total of 19 different viruses were detected in 1196 HFMD patients enrolled in the study, with enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6), CV-A10 and CV-A16 being the major causes. EV-A71 was associated with severe HFMD and consistently detected at a higher frequency during the second half of the years. The emergence of EV-A71 subgenogroup C4 in late 2018 was preceded by its low activity during 2017–early 2018. Compared with subgenogroup B5, C4 was more likely to be associated with severe HFMD. Collectively, despite the emergence of coxsackieviruses, EV-A71 remains the major cause of severe HFMD, and multivalent vaccines are urgently needed to control the ongoing HFMD challenge.
