Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic disease present in more than 90 countries. Different species of Leishmania produce skin ulcers upon infection through the bite of infected sand fly vectors. There are several drugs used to treat CL but most of them are toxic or difficult to administer and there is increasing drug resistance leading to treatment failure. Therefore, new drugs are needed for treating CL. The objective of this study was to determine the anti-leishmanial efficacy of antihistamine drugs. Using cell cultures of lymph nodes obtained from Leishmania major infected mice, we evaluated the parasiticidal activity of the antihistamine drugs azelastine and fexofenadine. Both drugs showed high efficacy against L. major and low toxicity for a human cell line. Treatment of mice infected in the skin with L. major indicated that both azelastine and fexofenadine significantly reduced the size of the lesions and suppressed parasite multiplication. Consequently, these two drugs are good candidates to further evaluate their efficacy as monotherapies or in combination with other anti-leishmanial drugs.
