The acute form of sleeping sickness in Africa is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. It is transmitted by tsetse flies and can be maintained in cycles involving both livestock and wildlife as hosts. Humans are incidentally infected and are particularly at risk of infection near protected areas where there is both wildlife and suitable habitat for tsetse. In these regions, the tsetse vector cannot be eradicated, nor can infection be prevented in wildlife. Here we use field studies of tsetse and livestock in combination with mathematical models of tsetse population change and trypanosome transmission to show that use of pyrethroid-based insecticides on cattle–by farmers at the edge of protected areas–could be contributing to lowering the risk of sleeping sickness in Serengeti District, Tanzania. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report farmer-led tsetse control, co-incident with tsetse decline and relatively low prevalence of T. brucei s.l. in cattle.
