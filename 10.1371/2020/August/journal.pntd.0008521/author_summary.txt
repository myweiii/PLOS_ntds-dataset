Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium leprae and is one of the major causes of preventable disability in low- and middle-income countries. Disabled people face lifelong socioeconomic challenges and are often excluded from society. It brings people affected by leprosy in a vicious cycle of poverty and disability. This cycle needs to be curbed through scientific evidence on health economic aspects of leprosy. Unfortunately, there is not much literature available on cost or cost-effectiveness of leprosy prevention. New prevention methods such as post-exposure chemoprophylaxis are now available, providing opportunity to collect up-to-date health economic evidence to support health policy and planning. Here, we present a cost-effectiveness study of contact screening in combination of post-exposure prophylaxis with single-dose rifampicin in the Union Territory of Dadra Nagar Haveli in India. We compare the intervention with the continuation of the routine leprosy control programme. As leprosy is moving towards elimination, evidence from this study will contribute to an investment case for leprosy elimination.
