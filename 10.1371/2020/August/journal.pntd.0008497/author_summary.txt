Rabies is an important viral zoonosis that causes approximately 59,000 human deaths every year. The vast majority of cases result from a bite from an infected dog. Annual vaccination of at least 70% of the dog population is recommended for elimination of canine rabies. Canine surgical sterilisation programmes are sometimes conducted alongside rabies vaccination. However the contribution of sterilisation to rabies control, above that of the vaccination alone, is controversial. This systematic review compared the outcomes and impacts of vaccination and sterilisation programmes with vaccination only programmes. Sixteen studies met the studyâ€™s formal inclusion criteria, however we were unable to answer the question using this evidence and the role of sterilisation remains unclear. We identify gaps in knowledge regarding the implementation and impact of the sterilisation component as well as any resulting effects on rabies transmission and control. Prospective studies evaluating the two types of intervention would provide comparative evidence, which is needed to enable informed decisions to be made regarding whether sterilisation should be conducted for the purposes of canine rabies control.
