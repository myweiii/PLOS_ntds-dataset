Urinary schistosomiasis caused by the parasitic blood fluke Schistosoma haematobium is an important public health concern in the tropics and subtropics. Freshwater snails of the genus Bulinus are the intermediate hosts and infection is acquired by contact with fresh water inhabited by infected snails. This means that transmission of the parasite strongly depends on environmental factors, which we wanted to explore in this study. Individually assessed questionnaire and laboratory data from a study in Mbeya Region in Southwestern Tanzania were combined with remotely sensed and other environmental data that were publicly available. We found that the odds of urinary schistosomiasis were higher in school-aged children and young adults than in older age groups and in children below 5 years. Odds of infection were also higher at lower altitudes, in areas with less vegetation and in the vicinity of Lake Nyasa. These results add to the general knowledge regarding S. haematobium infection and could help to design more effective control strategies in the future, both locally and on larger scales.
