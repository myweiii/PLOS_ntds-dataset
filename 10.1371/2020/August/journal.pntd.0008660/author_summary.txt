Aedes mosquitoes are the vectors that can transmit dengue fever and several other severe vector-borne viral diseases in the human population. Insects control and clear viral infections via their innate immune systems. Studies of the genes and molecules in mosquitos that control pathogen infection may provide insights into finding novel targets for controlling the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. In this study, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the role of MAPKs in Aedes mosquitoes following DENV2 infection in vitro and in vivo. Activation of the Ras/ERK pathway via insulin treatment and overexpression of Ras significantly decreased the DENV titers, whereas inhibition of the Ras/ERK pathway by either U0126 treatment or by Ras knockdown enhanced DENV infection. We demonstrated that the Ras/ERK signaling couples AMPs to mediate the resistance of Aedes mosquitoes to DENV infection, which reveals a novel antiviral mechanism regulated by multiple innate immune components in mosquitoes.
