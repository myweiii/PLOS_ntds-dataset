Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) or Kala-azar, classed as a neglected tropical disease, is still a major problem worldwide, aggravated by increasing parasitic resistance against the drugs commonly used for its treatment. Since the development of novel therapeutics involves exorbitant costs, the effectiveness of the currently available antitrypanosomatid drug suramin has been investigated as an antileishmanial, specifically for VL, in vitro and in animal model experiments. Our study showed that suramin is effective against L.donovani and significantly reduced the (splenic/hepatic) parasitic burden in L. donovani infected BALB/c mice, switching the immune response in the infected BALB/c mice from TH2 to a TH1 type. The ITC data confirmed that suramin does indeed interact with parasitic phosphoglycerate kinase (LmPGK) and enzyme assays demonstrated the inhibition of LmPGK due to the drug. Therefore, our investigation raises the possibility of suramin being included in the repertoire of drugs used to treat VL.
