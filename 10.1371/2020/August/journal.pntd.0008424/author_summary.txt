The Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in adults is usually characterized by mild flu-like symptoms, with most cases remaining asymptomatic. However, in the last years, widespread ZIKV infection was shown for the first time to be associated with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and death of neonates. It is estimated that CZS occurs in ~1–40% of cases of pregnant women infected by ZIKV, which suggests that different susceptibility factors might be involved, including the host genetic background. Here, by analyzing trophoblast cells that recapitulate the placenta from three pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS, we were able to show that trophoblasts from CZS-affected twins were significantly more susceptible to ZIKV infection when compared with trophoblasts from the non-affected twins. We also provide a detailed picture of genes differentially expressed by trophoblasts from the discordant twins after infection with ZIKV. These genes can be further investigated as possible therapeutic targets to avoid viral dissemination into developing fetus’ tissues. Our results suggest that CZS might be caused, among other factors, by a decreased ability of the placenta to respond to ZIKV infection in CZS-affected neonates, concomitant with a previously known deregulation of neural development genes in ZIKV-infected neuroprogenitor cells of these CZS-affected babies.
