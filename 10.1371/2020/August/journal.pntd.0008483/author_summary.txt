Clonorchiasis, caused by the fish-borne trematode Clonorchis sinensis, is a chronic liver infection and is classified as a neglected tropical disease, particularly in some Asian countries such as Vietnam. Light infections with C. sinensis are asymptomatic, yet heavy chronic infections are associated with clinical complications such as, bile duct obstruction, hepatic fibrosis and the most serious complication being bile duct cancer. We carried out a community-based study on C. sinensis infection in rural communities in northern Vietnam. Our results indicated that the Thac Ba lake area in Yen Bai province is a hot spot of C. sinensis infection, and that Thanh Hoa province remains an area with widespread small liver fluke infection. Eating raw fish was confirmed to be an important risk factor for C. sinensis infection in Vietnam. Presence of infection was furthermore associated with gender, age, education and hygienic practices. Mass drug administration and improved awareness campaigns for the population in these regions are needed. Setting-specific interventions targeting different risk groups should be considered to reduce the disease transmission.
