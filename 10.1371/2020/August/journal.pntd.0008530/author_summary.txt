Recurrent episodes of typhoid fever can occur in individuals, particularly those living in typhoid endemic regions. Natural typhoid infection should, in theory, offer a degree of protection against future typhoid, however, this protection has only been assessed in a limited number of studies, none of which were conducted recently nor in the context of a carefully controlled clinical trial. The findings from our study, which were based on data from a cluster-randomized trial of Vi polysaccharide vaccine in Kolkata, India, suggest that previous typhoid fever does not provide an appreciable level of protection against future typhoid disease. This finding is important for informing mathematical modelers who predict transmission dynamics within a population and influence the design of effective vaccine intervention strategies.
