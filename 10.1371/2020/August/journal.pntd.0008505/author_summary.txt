Intestinal worm infections are extremely frequent in areas where sanitation, access to clean water, and hygiene measures are poor. These infections negatively affect the nutritional status and development of children and women. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the periodic administration of anthelmintic drugs as one of the components of a control strategy to eliminate these infections. Since 2010, WHO has managed two donations of anthelmintics (i.e., albendazole and mebendazole) that are provided to ministries of health in endemic countries. The present paper summarizes anthelmintic treatment coverage data over a 10-year period (2008â€“2018) from over 690 reports (reporting for more than 3.3 billion tablets) submitted to WHO by ministries of health. It also reports on the results of surveys, which have been conducted in several countries to evaluate the impact of the drug distribution. Lastly, it presents global objectives for the control of intestinal worm infections, to be achieved by 2030, as identified by a panel of WHO experts and collaborators. In conclusion, the program for the control of intestinal worm infections has steadily progressed between 2008 and 2018 and achieving a coverage level of over 60% in school-age children. The health consequences of these infections have also been significantly reduced. With sustained program implementation, the elimination of these worm infections as a public health problem might be achieved by 2030.
