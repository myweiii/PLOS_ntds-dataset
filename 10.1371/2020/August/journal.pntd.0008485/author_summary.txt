Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a disease caused by fungi living in the soil, which are inhaled mainly by rural workers from Latin America. These fungi are classified into the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex and Paracoccidioides lutzii. PCM may involve any organ and its treatment frequently results in fibrotic scars and functional limitations, which not rarely lead to early retirement. The mycological examination performed by routine laboratory tests cannot identify these species. However, the serological tests can suggest what species the etiological agent is, long as an antigen from both species is used. In order to determine whether there are differences in epidemiological aspects, clinical manifestations, severity, treatment response, and intensity of lung lesions according to the species involved, we compared 51 patients with serological profile suggestive of PCM caused by P. brasiliensis complex with 16 others caused by P. lutzii. Our results showed no differences between these species related to the parameters evaluated. Nevertheless, other clinical variables should be evaluated to detect differences regarding species. This study reinforces the importance of using antigens from both species for serological tests in PCM diagnosis, determination of severity, treatment follow-up and control of cure.
