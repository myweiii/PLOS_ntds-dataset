The current treatment for Buruli ulcer (BU), an infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is based on a daily antibiotic combination of rifampin associated with streptomycin or clarithromycin. A shorter or intermittent treatment without an injectable drug would clearly simplify the management in the field. We evaluated the bactericidal activity of several new antimicrobial drugs in a mouse model of BU and found that telacebec (Q203) exhibited the greatest bactericidal effect. We subsequently identified new antibiotic combinations containing telacebec with high sterilizing activity when administered twice a week for 8 weeks, i.e. at a total of only 16 doses.
