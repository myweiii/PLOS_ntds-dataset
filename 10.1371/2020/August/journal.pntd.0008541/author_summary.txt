There is a lack of data on comparing the observed dengue incidences under the real-world scenarios that interventions commenced at different times. In 2019, WHO scaled up the response to dengue due to the escalation of outbreaks occurring in many countries. In the same year, local government in Guangzhou started the Grade III response to dengue one month ahead in August. It is uncertain the degree to which the early intervention mitigated dengue burden. Our study examined the effectiveness of early start of Grade III response in Guangzhou using a quasi-Poisson regression model by comparing the dengue incidence with early start of Grade III response and that under the counterfactual scenario that the Grade III response began in September as in 2017 and 2018. We estimated that 987 dengue cases were averted due to the early start of Grade III response, which were equivalent to 71.4% of the total number of local dengue cases in 2019. Early start of Grade III response reduced the dengue burden, which might be partially through controlling the mosquito vector density. Dengue intervention strategies applied in Guangzhou could provide experience on how to effectively prevent and control dengue for other locations with dengue epidemics.
