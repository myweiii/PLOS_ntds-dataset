This study aimed to present a plan for scabies control by investigating the current status of scabies and management in long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and by identifying the general characteristics of nursing staff managing scabies patients at nursing homes. To determine the incidence of scabies in LTCHs, we contacted all the 1,336 LTCHs registered at the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in South Korea in 2018. Among them, 256 LTCHs agreed to participate in the present study, but only 110 LTCHs completed the survey questionnaire. Studies have shown that scabies is common in LTCHs, and secondary bacterial infection is also common in patients with scabies. Moreover, the incidence rate of scabies has increased in the last 5 years even in LTCHs with highly educated healthcare staff, manuals on the prevention and management of scabies, and infection reporting systems. Regular and enhanced staff training is needed, considering that most hospitals have rarely focused on the handling of equipment and furniture used by scabies patients and on educating their healthcare staff. These findings can be used to develop various strategies to reduce the prevalence of scabies.
