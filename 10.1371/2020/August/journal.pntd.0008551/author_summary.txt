Soil-transmitted helminths are parasitic worms that infect an estimated 1 billion people globally, primarily in low- and middle-income countries. One of the main strategies to reduce the prevalence of these parasitic infections is through preventive chemotherapyâ€”the periodic widespread treatment of an entire at-risk population (e.g. children) with albendazole or mebendazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) tracks the progress of mass deworming programs by estimating the national coverage of these programs through aggregation of local health district program reports, which represent the proportion of at-risk people in a country that are reported to have received deworming treatment. In this study, we used an alternative source of data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) that provides maternally-reported child deworming treatment to estimate coverage in pre-school aged children and was subsequently compared to data reported to WHO. We conducted this comparison of deworming coverage at a sub-national level for three countries with available data: Burundi, Myanmar, and the Philippines. Coverage reported to WHO and estimated by DHS were broadly consistent in Burundi, highly discrepant in Myanmar, and varied in agreement for the Philippines. These differences may be explained by variability in the medication distribution monitoring practices, quality of national validation systems, and mis-reporting due to albendazole receipt through non-STH related public health campaigns (e.g. lymphatic filariasis treatment). This analysis suggests that in specific settings, DHS data can complement deworming coverage data reported to WHO, serving as an independent source of data to improve monitoring and evaluation of deworming programs globally.
