Campylobacter is the leading bacterial cause of gastroenteritis worldwide and despite high incidence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where infection can be fatal, culture based isolation is rare and the genotypes responsible for disease have not broadly been identified. The epidemiology of disease is different to that in high income countries, where sporadic infection associated with contaminated food consumption typically leads to acute gastroenteritis. In some LMICs infection is endemic among children and common asymptomatic carriage is associated with malnutrition, attenuated growth in early childhood, and poor cognitive and physical development. Here, we sequenced the genomes of isolates sampled from children in the Peruvian Amazon to investigate genotypes associated with varying disease severity and the source of infection. Among the common globally circulating genotypes and local genotypes rarely seen before, no single lineage was responsible for symptomatic or asymptomatic infectionâ€“suggesting an important role for host factors. However, consistent with other countries, poultry-associated strains were a likely major source of infection. This genomic surveillance approach, that integrates microbial ecology with population based studies in humans and animals, has considerable potential for describing cryptic epidemiology in LMICs and will inform work to improve infant health worldwide.
