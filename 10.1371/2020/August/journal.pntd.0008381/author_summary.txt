We enrolled 200 severely ill patients in an observational study of sepsis in Takeo Province Cambodia. In an effort to provide an in-depth characterization of their illness, we combined standard clinical microbiology practices (culture, microscopy, etc) with serological analyses, newer molecular diagnostics, and next-generation sequencing to produce the most detailed characterization to date of sepsis and microbiological cause for southern Cambodia. Specifically, we were able to identify a causative pathogen in 46.5% of cases. A viral source was identified in 26 (13%) patients and bacterial source in 79 (39.5%) patients. In all, we detected 139 infections in 93 (46.5%) patients. Despite our best efforts though, 52.5% of the cohort remained undiagnosed, further underscoring the urgent need for new infectious disease diagnostics that can identify the cause of infections in near real time.
