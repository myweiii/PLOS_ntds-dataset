Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected zoonosis caused by infection with the parasite Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, naturally transmitted between canids and livestock; CE in humans can be a serious condition. In endemic areas, CE is responsible for significant health and economic losses, but its real burden is difficult to estimate. E. granulosus s.l. is especially present in areas where livestock breeding is practiced, including European Mediterranean and Balkan countries. We carried out a systematic literature review on the epidemiology of E. granulosus s.l. human and animal infection in this area in 2000–2019. Data were extracted from 79 publications, and referred to Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) levels per year. Average annual incidence rates of human CE ranged from 0.10–7.74/100,000; pooled prevalences ranged from 0.003–64.09% in cattle, 0.004–68.73% in sheep, and 0–31.86% in dogs. Bovine data showed a more similar pattern to human data compared to sheep and dogs. Our results confirm that Italy, Spain, and Eastern Europe are the most affected areas, but data are extremely heterogeneous, geographical coverage very patchy, and human prevalence studies extremely scant. Results also highlight the well-known problem of underreporting of E. granulosus s.l. infection in both humans and animals.
