Serpins are protease inhibitors that regulate various biological processes, including digestion, blood coagulation, inflammation and immune responses. The liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, produces an array of inhibitors to regulate proteolytic enzymes they encounter during development within the mammalian host. In this study, we identified seven different serpins that have evolved to inhibit a range of host proteases. In particular, we characterized two representatives, FhSrp1 and FhSrp2, that we found highly expressed on the surface of the invasive newly excysted juvenile (NEJ), suggesting that they protect the parasites from harmful proteolytic effects during invasion. Contrasting inhibitory profiles were observed; while recombinant FhSrp1 inhibited kallikrein, recombinant FhSrp2 was a highly potent inhibitor of chymotrypsin. The unusual inhibition of kallikrein suggests that rFhSrp1 influences host responses such as inflammation and vascular permeability by interfering with the kallikrein-kinin system. Conversely, chymotrypsin is typically inhibited by trematode-specific serpins, implying a conserved mechanism to regulate digestive enzymes. The ability of the liver fluke serpin family to inhibit such an array of proteases highlights the importance of these inhibitors in parasite-host interactions and encourages future investigations of serpins as candidate anti-parasite vaccine targets for the control of fasciolosis in ruminants.
