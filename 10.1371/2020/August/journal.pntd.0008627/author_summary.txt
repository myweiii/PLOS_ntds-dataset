Human filarial parasites are the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) and onchocerciasis (river blindness) and are some of the most important causes of morbidity worldwide. A large obstacle to research on these organisms has been the inability to employ reverse genetic methods and to develop integrated transgenic parasite lines. Recently, we developed a piggyBac transposon-based method that employed a co-culture system that permitted the infective larval stage of B. malayi to be transfected by lipofection in culture, resulting in the production of developmentally competent transgenic parasites. However, the piggyBac system cannot be used to precisely edit particular sequences in the genome. Thus, the piggyBac system has generally been supplanted by Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) based technology, which permits precise targeting (and editing) of particular sequences in the genome. Here, we report building upon the methods developed for piggyBac mediated transfection of B. malayi to develop a CRISPR mediated method for precise transgenesis in this parasite.
