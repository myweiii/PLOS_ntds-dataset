HTLV-1 is endemic in Africa where it infects millions of individuals and causes Adult T Leukemia. Thirty years ago, an epidemiological study was performed in Gabon, where HTLV-1 is endemic. This revealed a high prevalence of this retroviral infection. Thirty years later, we performed a larger study in the general Gabonese population. This reveals that this oncogenic retrovirus is still highly frequent in this country and that prevalence remains unchanged. It would be extremely important to inform the general population about this infection in order to be able to decrease this retrovirus transmission.
