Human lymphatic filariasis (LF) and river blindness (onchocerciasis) are highly debilitating neglected tropical diseases. As with all parasitic nematodes, Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori, the etiological agents of LF and Onchocerca volvulus the causative agent of river blindness, possess limited lipid metabolic pathways and hence rely on lipids scavenged from their human hosts. Two unusual lipid-trafficking proteins from Brugia malayi (Bm-FAR-1 and Bm-FAR-2) were expressed as recombinant proteins, and their ligand binding activities along with their structural characteristics were examined. Their immunogenicity in infected children and those who are classified as endemic normal or putatively naturally immune were also evaluated. Their immunogenicity and immunoprotective efficacies were also evaluated in a B. malayi gerbil infection model. The possible role these proteins play in the survival of filarial nematodes in the host, and their prospects of being candidates for vaccine against these highly pathogenic infections are discussed.
