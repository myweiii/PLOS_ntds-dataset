Today, infections with soil-transmitted helminths are diagnosed by looking for the eggs of these helminths in stool samples using different microscopic techniques. However, these standard diagnostic techniques still show a number of limitations. The FECPAKG2 method was recently developed for diagnosing worm infections in the veterinary field and could also be useful to diagnose human helminth infections. This method produces digital images of helminth eggs that have been concentrated into one microscopic field of view and stores these images online. This eliminates the need for skilled technicians and opens the possibility for standardized quality control and possibly even automated egg counting by egg recognition software. This study presents, for the first time, a standard operating FECPAKG2 procedure for the detection and quantification of human STH eggs. We optimized the sedimentation and accumulation steps in the FECPAKG2 procedure for the detection of human helminth eggs using stool samples from naturally infected children. This established protocol allows for a thorough and objective evaluation of the system as a diagnostic tool that shows potential for implementation in future STH control programs.
