RNA-binding proteins are essential for control of gene expression in trypanosomes and leishmanias. ZC3H30 is a protein which was shown to bind to mRNAs; when it is attached to an mRNA, that mRNA is degraded. Procyclic-form trypanosomes that lack ZC3H30 grow normally under standard conditions, but were susceptible to various stresses: heat shock, and treatment with ethanol, a reducing agent, or arsenite. ZC3H30 interacts with one other protein, and both proteins migrate to RNA-protein granules after heat shock or starvation. These results, combined with others, suggest that ZC3H30 is involved in mRNA protection after stress. The conservation of the ZC3H30 gene in related parasites, including those that infect only arthropods, combined with the increased stress susceptibility of cells lacking it, suggests that ZC3H30 confers a selective advantage in the wild, where the parasites are subject to temperature fluctuations and immune attack in both the insect and mammalian hosts.
