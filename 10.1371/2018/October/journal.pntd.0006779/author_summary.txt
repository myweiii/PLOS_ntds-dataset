Typhoid is an invasive bacterial disease causing 26 million illness episodes globally, each year particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa afflicting children and poorer sections of society disproportionally. AMR is increasingly recognized among S. Typhi lineages spreading from South Asia to Africa, with resistance to first line antibiotics (co-trimoxazole, ampicillin and chloramphenicol), and fluoroquinolones and, of concern, cephalosporins which contribute to treatment failure. AMR in typhoid is not uniform globally and has evolved at different rates in various endemic regions. These trends have not been systematically analysed previously and the objectives of this study included reviewing the phenotypic and genetic determinants of AMR globally over time. The significance of this study revolves around identifying the different trends and mechanisms of AMR and planning interventional strategies accordingly, particularly in light of the Vi-conjugate vaccine candidate which recently received SAGE recommendation and WHO pre-qualification.
