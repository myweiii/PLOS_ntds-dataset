On the northwestern coast of Colombia three lethal outbreaks of rickettsioses caused by the species Rickettsia rickettsii have been reported. The lack of an active epidemiological surveillance system in these areas makes difficult the detection and the timely treatment of the disease prompting a worse prognosis. In this study, new cases of rickettsial infection were detected in people and horses living in areas where outbreaks of the disease occurred in the previous decade. In addition, the results showed that nonspecific febrile syndromes are associated to rickettsial infection and protective measures such as tick removal from the body decrease the risk of infection. The design, evaluation and implementation of a surveillance program of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as rickettsioses, should be a priority in the country, especially in areas where such infections have proved to be lethal.
