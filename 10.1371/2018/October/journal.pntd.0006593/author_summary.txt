The Dengue Illness Index (DII) is a tool that was developed to improve and standardize the measurement of vaccine and drug efficacy in reducing moderate dengue illness by capturing the overall subjective disease experience of an individual based on how the totality of their symptoms impacts their wellness and daily functionality. The DII was applied to a diary card, the Dengue Illness Card (DIC), which was examined and further developed by a working group. The resulting DIC was then refined with feedback garnered from a Delphi methodology-based query that addressed the adequacy and applicability of the card in dengue research. Here, we report on the Delphi results and present the final DIC.
