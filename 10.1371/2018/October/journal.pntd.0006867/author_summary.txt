Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE) is the causative agent of yaws, a multi-stage disease that is endemic in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and South America. TPE belongs to the pathogenic treponemes and causes several human and animal infections. Whole genome sequences of two TPE strains isolated from patients in Indonesia were determined in this study. While both strains were highly related to other TPE strains isolated from humans and baboons, detailed genetic analyses revealed a modular character of several genes and genomic regions. While TPE genomes appear to be the most conserved genomes of uncultivable pathogenic treponemes, diversification of TPE genomes appears to be facilitated by intra-strain genome recombination events. In addition to genes with an identified modular structure, we identified additional genes that have direct or inverted repeats and thus have the potential for genetic reshuffling.
