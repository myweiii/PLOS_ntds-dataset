Kenya experienced its first chikungunya outbreak in 2004/2005 along the coastal area, followed by sporadic outbreaks in Mandera in 2016, and subsequently in Mombasa city in late 2017 and early 2018. Despite the rising risk of transmission of the virus in the country based on evidence of outbreaks in Kenya, vector competence studies have only been limited to Ae. aegypti, while the role played by other Aedes species largely remain unknown. This study demonstrated the ability of Ae. bromeliae and Ae. vittatus to transmit chikungunya virus under controlled laboratory conditions. Vector competence remains the most important approach in disease risk assessment that provides knowledge to the public health sector in developing vector control guideline.
