In the present work, we found that E. histolytica intestinal infections are rarely diagnosed among travelers and migrants presenting in a national reference travel clinic in Europe. Microscopic finding of cysts or trophozoites and antigen testing cannot discriminate between Entamoeba histolytica/dispar infection, which leads to overdiagnosis of E. histolytica infections in low resource settings where PCR is not available. We found visualization of trophozoites under the microscope helpful in discriminating between E. histolytica and E. dispar infection in direct smears. Hematophagy is a very rare finding but in our experience was always associated with E. histolytica infection. In a context where only microscopy is available, a patient presenting with blood or mucus in stool or cramps should anyhow be treated as amoebiasis if Entamoeba histolytica/dispar cysts/trophozoites are found. Nevertheless it is worth noting that a sizeable proportion of E. histolytica cases were asymptomatic. Last, our study suggests that E. dispar might be pathogenic but symptoms in E. histolytica infected patients were clearly more often suggestive of intestinal tissue invasion.
