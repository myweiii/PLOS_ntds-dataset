Human T-Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects at least 5 to 10 million people worldwide and is associated with severe diseases. Africa, particularly the sub-Saharan region, is considered as the largest HTLV-1 endemic area. HTLV-1 can be acquired through three main routes: mother-to-child, sexual and through contaminated blood products. In addition, zoonotic transmission from non-human primates still occurs in specific rural African populations. Gabon is considered to be a very high HTLV-1 endemic area. However, risk factors for such a retroviral infection remain poorly known in Central Africa. In this study, using state-of-the-art serological and molecular tests, we aimed to get new insights on risk factors associated with HTLV-1 infection in rural Gabon. We report an overall prevalence of HTLV-1 of 8.7%, demonstrating that HTLV-1 is highly endemic in rural adult Gabonese populations. In the study population, we identified female gender, increasing age, ethnicity (Pygmy) and multiple hospitalizations (more than 5 times) as independent risk factors for HTLV-1 infection. Furthermore, a non-human primate bite appeared to be marginally associated with a higher risk of HTLV-1 infection. Our results regarding the risk factors for such a retroviral infection are important for public health actions aiming to reduce HTLV-1 transmission.
