With few exceptions, canine rabies is endemic in developing countries. The mortality rate of rabies approaches 100%. However, disease is preventable via the timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following a rabid animal bite. Additionally, canine rabies can be controlled in dog populations through mass vaccination. Economics drive the majority of policy and decision making and as such, a robust understanding of the cost of prevention and control methods is useful for the development and implementation of rabies management strategies. The majority of afflicted individuals are poor and reside in rural regions, where knowledge of rabies is minimal and access and affordability of PEP are limited. A greater emphasis on mass dog vaccination is a cost effective method of eliminating canine rabies at the source, which decreases the need for human PEP and reduces the burden of human mortality within vulnerable populations.
