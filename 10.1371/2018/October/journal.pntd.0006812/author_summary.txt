Foamy viruses infect a lot of mammalian hosts including non-human primates (NHP) and humans. Foamy infection is not associated with disease, although a recent report described hematological abnormalities in infected humans. Some NHP species are also naturally infected with another retrovirus i.e. Simian T lymphotropic virus type 1, while humans are infected with the Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 counterpart. Both viruses cause leukemia. Here we report that natural foamy/STLV-1 co-infection is associated with a higher foamy virus proviral load in blood. Co-infected animals might therefore present a higher risk of developing hematological disease.
