Visceral leishmaniasis is a tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sand flies. Infected dogs are considered the main urban reservoir of parasite. Identification and euthanasia of infected dogs is one of the main strategies for VL control recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Hence, to improve the efficacy of control measures, it is essential an accurate diagnose of naturally infected dogs in endemic areas. Herein, we sought to produce a new immunodiagnostic test using recombinant antigens of Leishmania infantum to improve the performance of the diagnosis of CVL recommended by Brazilian Ministry of Health.
