Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common form of this group of parasitic diseases, transmitted by sandflies. In sub-Saharan Africa, its extent of the problem is unknown, while elsewhere its disfigurement and stigma may cause a severe impact. This study systematically searched the literature to find evidence on the epidemiological data on human CL in this part of the world. Historically, CL has been present for decades in both western and eastern Africa, but unfortunately, in the last decades, the data are irregular and patchy. The estimated burden, relying on detected cases, may only capture part of the true number of cases. This article shows that there is insufficient evidence to have accurate figures; the diversity of the disease, along with poor surveillance have resulted in unprecedented CL outbreaks in the past. Many knowledge gaps remain, and we highlight the importance of improving the current fragmented knowledge by increasing commitments to tackle CL and conduct better population studies. CL in sub-Saharan Africa appears to be a blind spot and should not remain so.
