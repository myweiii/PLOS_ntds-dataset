Sparganosis is most prevalent in developing countries in East and Southeast Asia, probably because public health strategies have not prioritized its prevention. The plerocercoid larvae of Spirometra mansoni sometimes invade the brain parenchyma, resulting in cerebral sparganosis. In general, surgical removal of the larvae is considered a standard therapy for cerebral sparganosis. One alternative treatment for sparganosis is short-term, low-dose praziquantel, which has had limited success. However, the efficacy and safety of long-term, high-dose praziquantel treatment for cerebral sparganosis have not been explored. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, high-dose praziquantel for treatment of cerebral sparganosis in China. We conducted a retrospective exploratory study using routinely recorded data from 96 patients at three medical centers. Forty-two patients underwent surgical lesion removal, and the other 54 patients received long-term, high-dose praziquantel. Treatment of cerebral sparganosis by long-term, high-dose praziquantel showed an efficacy similar to that of surgical lesion removal with respect to the primary outcome (complete disappearance of the active lesions on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging). However, this was a small-sample, nonrandomized retrospective study, and the results should be further confirmed by a large-sample prospective study or other studies.
