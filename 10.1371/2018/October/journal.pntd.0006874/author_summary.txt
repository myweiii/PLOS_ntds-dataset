Brucella are bacteria that mainly infect animals. They can also be transmitted to humans and cause a serious disease called brucellosis. Half the world's population is considered exposed, especially in the poorest rural areas. Experts agree that prompt identification of Brucella isolates is essential to provide appropriate treatment to patients and to control epidemiological outbreaks. Mis-identification of these highly infectious pathogens may lead to delays in diagnosis, but also to increased risks of accidental exposure for laboratory workers. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is now the first line of bacterial identification in many routine diagnostic laboratories. However, not all clinical mass spectrometers can identify Brucella. In this work, we updated a database with Brucella spectra to improve the performance of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers. These instruments will now be able to identify accurately Brucella isolates. This will greatly improve the diagnosis of brucellosis.
