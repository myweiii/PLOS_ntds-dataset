Snakebite is a neglected disease and a major health issue in tropical countries. Bites by Bothrops snakes (jararacas) are frequent throughout South and Central Americas and usually lead to inflammatory and bleeding manifestations in patients, which may be highly severe in some cases. Antivenom therapy is highly effective and the only officially recommended treatment for snakebites, but it is well known that it is not quite effective in blocking various secondary complications. We reasoned that rutin–an easily available and inexpensive plant-based compound–would have the ability to favorably minimize venom-induced low circulating fibrinogen levels, low blood platelet counts, local hemorrhage, bleedings, and raised production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during jararaca envenomation. We observed that rutin had remarkably beneficial effects, much higher than we originally expected, in most of the evaluated tests, and such effect was apparently not due to inhibition of the snake venom. Therefore, our results indicate that rutin has a great potential as an ancillary drug in concert with antivenom therapy to treat snakebites, particularly in countries where antivenom availability is scarce. Although we studied the effects of rutin on an experimental model, and further in vivo studies are necessary, our results are extraordinarily encouraging.
