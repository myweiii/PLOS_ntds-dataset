Dengue virus infection is one of the most critical public health issues, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. This study developed statistical predictive models using the data obtained from 257 Thai children for dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome using structural equation modelling (SEM). We performed SEM based on clinical and laboratory factors on three and one day(s) prior to fever resolution. Our SEM models showed that age, tourniquet test, aspartate aminotransferase, and white blood cell, % lymphocytes, and platelet counts on three days prior to fever resolution were important risk factors for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Age, aspartate aminotransferase, hematocrit, tourniquet test, and white blood cell and platelet counts were important risk factors for dengue shock syndrome. Our predictive models showed good performances in the validation subjects (n = 897) who were not used for SEM, and thus we concluded that our predictive models can be practically used to guide clinical management of suspected dengue patients. Our study also showed that SEM can be used to predict the developments or severities of other illnesses.
