Rift Valley fever (RVF), is a neglected vector-borne zoonotic disease, commonly occurring in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It causes severe socio-economic and public health impacts on livestock, humans and environment, placing further economic demands on pastoralist communities already experiencing high level of poverty. There is urgent need to develop new surveillance and control approaches that will identify and tackle RVF in under-privileged communities. One such approach would be by use of Participatory Epidemiology, which involves local communities in the surveillance of diseases, empowering them as agents of change rather than relegating them to disease information providers. RVF is a disease with global implication, but it starts at local level. Therefore, to control this neglected disease, it is important to understand exiting veterinary knowledge contained in the local communities. Using a bottom-up perspective, we investigated factors that influence RVF occurrence and pathways for its entry, spread and consequences in herds. By devising acceptable and cost-effective methods of investigations, we believe pastoralist communities can be encouraged to be the first line of defense against RVF and other neglected animal diseases. Furthermore, policies aimed at preventing RVF occurrence in animals and humans would be beneficiary if pastoral communities are fully involved.
