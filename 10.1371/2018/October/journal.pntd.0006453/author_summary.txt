Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a fatal parasitic disease transmitted by sandflies, has been targeted for elimination as a public health problem in the Indian subcontinent by 2020. The goal has been reached in the majority of endemic regions in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, but the disease persists in several hotspots. Better understanding of spatial clustering of VL cases and the role of asymptomatically infected individuals in transmission is required to improve control interventions and sustain the elimination target. To address this issue, we have fitted an individual-level spatiotemporal model of VL transmission to geo-located incidence data from Bangladesh to estimate the rate at which VL risk decreases with distance from a case and the potential contribution of asymptomatic individuals to transmission. Our results suggest that VL risk decreases quickly with distance and that symptomatic individuals are the main drivers of transmission, highlighting the potential for spatially-targeted control interventions to reduce transmission.
