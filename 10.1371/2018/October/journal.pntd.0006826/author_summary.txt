Misconceptions about sleeping sickness, a neglected tropical disease transmitted by tsetse flies, can be a hindrance to effective implementation of control interventions especially in the face of accelerating work to eliminate the disease. Understanding community knowledge, attitudes and practices about sleeping sickness is important in developing appropriate material for educating and sensitizing communities at risk of the disease. We conducted a study to establish community knowledge, attitudes and practices, including preferred channels of disseminating sleeping sickness information. Despite the fact that the community in Yei County knew about the disease, existing myths and stigma have the potential of influencing their health seeking behaviour.
The radio, community health workers and village elders were the most preferred sources of sharing information with the community. There is need to develop education and awareness material to address issues of existing myths, potential stigma, treat ability of HAT, importance of testing and treatment, as well as provide information on the new/improved testing and treatment approaches for HAT. In addition, this should be provided through use of preferred and trusted sources of information dissemination, which is critical in uptake of HAT control, management and prevention activities.
