Disseminated histoplasmosis, a disease that often resembles and is mistaken for tuberculosis, is a major cause of death in patients with advanced HIV disease. Histoplasma antigen detection tests are an important addition to the diagnostic arsenal for patients with advanced HIV disease and should be considered for inclusion on the World Health Organization Essential Diagnostics List. Our objective was to systematically review the literature to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Histoplasma antigen tests in the context of advanced HIV disease, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries. Systematic review of the published literature extracted data on comparator groups, type of histoplasmosis, HIV status, performance results, patient numbers, whether patients were consecutively enrolled or if the study used biobank samples. At the end of the screening process we included a total of 16 studies in humans for further analysis. Most studies included used a heterogeneous group of patients, often without HIV or mixing HIV and non HIV patients, with disseminated or non-disseminated forms of histoplasmosis. Patient numbers were generally small in individual studies and, in most of these, no confidence intervals were given. When considering the diagnostic accuracy of Histoplasma antigen detection tests evaluated among consecutive HIV-infected patients with confirmed histoplasmosis, the performance of the tests was good. These non invasive diagnostic tools would be very useful for HIV care givers at the level of reference hospitals or hospitals with the infrastructure to perform ELISA tests. Antigen detection tests are promising tools to improve detection of and ultimately reduce the burden of histoplasmosis mortality in patients with advanced HIV disease.
