Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease, commonly known as dog tapeworm. The disease is distributed globally and predominantly affects rural populations with limited access to health care. Following the expert consensus of the WHO-Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (WHO—IWGE) patients with uncomplicated cysts are assigned on the basis of WHO cyst classification to four treatment modalities: medical (benzimidazoles), percutaneous, surgical treatment, and ‘watch & wait’. In Mongolia, one third of the population practices nomadic farming. These populations are heavily affected by CE. However, cyst staging and WHO-IWGE recommendations are not implemented and patients referred to the three national treatment centres receive surgical treatment. This exposes a large proportion of patients to an unnecessary high risk approach who could be treated–depending on cyst stage—with benzimidazoles, percutaneously or observed (watch & wait). We reviewed the hospital records of patients with CE and admitted between 2008 and 2015 to the three national CE treatment centres, retrospectively staged the cysts and assigned the patients to the four WHO-IWGE recommended treatment modalities. We found a high proportion of patients in the study population who would have most likely benefitted from non-surgical treatment options.
