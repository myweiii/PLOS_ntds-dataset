Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus (CHIKV) and has been incriminated in the development of arthralgia (pain of the joint) and arthritis particularly in elderly patients. Methotrexate (MTX) has been used widely to effectively treat these chronic rheumatic symptoms. Using a model of primary human joint fibroblasts (HSF), we investigated the capacity of the MTX immunosuppressive drug to affect the immune antiviral and inflammatory responses essential to clear the virus while allowing bone tissue repair. This study is important given that CHIKV and its RNA were shown to persist in the joint for months to years post infection and leading to injuries through ill-characterized mechanisms. The molecule PIC was used to mimic the effect of viral RNA. Interestingly, we found that MTX did not affect the expression of several proinflammatory and bone repair factors by HSF. Remarkably, MTX did not also impair the antiviral response of synovial fibroblasts. Our study revealed for the first time that MTX treatment should be considered as safe even in the context of viral persistence associated with chronic inflammation. MTX will not affect the capacity of the synovial tissue to maintain antiviral mechanism, to control inflammation and to promote bone tissue repair.
