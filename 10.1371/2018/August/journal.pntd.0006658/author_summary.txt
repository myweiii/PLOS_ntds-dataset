Gastrointestinal disease following food-poisoning can cause severe clinical signs in humans and represent high costs for society. Examples of bacteria causing foodborne diseases include Salmonella and Campylobacter. In low to middle income countries, where resources are limited and a significant part of the population cannot always afford treatment, foodborne diseases such as Campylobacteriosis can play an important role in child mortality. Chickens and undercooked chicken meat have been found to commonly harbour this bacterium. In countries like Kenya, where fast urbanisation is occurring and chicken farming systems are intensifying, diets and food retailing infrastructure are also changing. Scientific research has not yet well documented how widely distributed Campylobacter is in such changing contexts, and which risk factors can favour its presence. In this study, the researchers have investigated small chicken farms and chicken meat sellers in Nairobi, Kenyaâ€™s capital, to better understand the risk that Campylobacter could represent for human health.
