Echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by ingestion of tapeworm eggs in feces of wild or domestic canids (e.g. foxes, wolves, coyotes, and dogs). In North America, the number of new human echinococcosis cases reported annually is low; however, recent reports of these parasites in unusual presentations, in new locations, and in wildlife near urban areas have caused renewed interest by veterinary and human health professionals. In a cross-border collaboration, we examined the intestines of wolves (Canis lupus), coyotes (C. latrans) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes, V. lagopus) trapped in Qu√©bec (Canada) and neighboring Maine (USA), using genetic tools to identify Echinococcus tapeworms. We did not detect E. multilocularis, a serious threat to human health that has recently emerged in southern Ontario. We did identify E. canadensis in wolves and coyotes, in both Quebec and Maine. The presence of this parasite in coyotes is especially concerning because coyotes are more likely to come into close proximity with human communities. This information is relevant to veterinarians who should promote regular fecal examination and/or deworming of high risk dogs (dogs that scavenge or hunt cervids, such as moose), to physicians who might encounter this relatively rare disease, and to public health agencies who should promote surveillance and develop precautions for high risk people.
