Chagas disease is a chronic neglected tropical disease, with high prevalence and burden in Latin America. About 30% of chronically infected patients develop Chagas cardiomyopathy. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and treatment approaches include medications, resynchronization therapy, and implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Studies published from 1980 to 1990 have evaluated the effect of amiodarone. According to our systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis, amiodarone reduced ventricular tachycardia, ventricular premature beats and incidence of ventricular couplets. Although the strong evidence of clinical benefit with arrhythmia reduction, this information should be interpreted with caution, since arrhythmia is a surrogate outcome and since its clinical impact on death and hospitalization reduction over time is not clear. Little information was identified related to hard endpoints. Regarding side effects, our systematic review observed that amiodarone was associated with corneal microdeposits, gastrointestinal events, sinus bradycardia, dermatological events, pneumonitis, hypothyroidism and drug discontinuation. The currently available evidence shows that amiodarone seems to be an effective antiarrhythmic drug for patients with Chagas disease, especially in settings where an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is not available or affordable, but that a balance between potential benefits and harms at the individual level is needed.
