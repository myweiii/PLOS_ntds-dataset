Buruli ulcer, a neglected tropical skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is treatable since 2004 with antibiotics instead of surgery. Treatment with either rifampin plus streptomycin or, more recently, rifampin plus clarithromycin requires taking the drugs daily for 8 weeks. Streptomycin is administered by injection and may result in hearing loss. Clarithromycin often causes gastrointestinal discomfort. Our goal is to identify a regimen that is both shorter and associated with fewer side effects. Rifampin, previously an expensive drug, is well tolerated not only at the standard dose of 10 mg/kg but at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg. The related rifamycin, rifapentine, has a longer half-life and is also well tolerated. We tested in a mouse model of Buruli ulcer whether higher doses of these rifamycins together with clofazimine, a drug that has transient skin pigmentation side effects but no toxicities, could effectively reduce lesion size, the number of bacteria, and production of the mycolactone toxin, in a shorter time than that for the existing drug regimens. We found that treatment for 4 weeks with a high dose rifamycin plus clofazimine is as effective as 8 weeks of the current standard regimens of rifampin plus streptomycin or rifampin plus clarithromycin.
