The sand fly Phlebotomus perniciosus is the principle vector of Leishmania infantum, causing canine leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean basin. While the sand fly female takes a blood meal, it injects saliva into the host skin, evoking a specific antibody response in the host. The antibody level in the host correlates with the intensity of exposure to sand flies. Previously, the specific antibody response (IgG) against a salivary protein of P. perniciosus—SP03B—has been proposed as a valid biomarker to estimate dog exposure to P. perniciosus in the Mediterranean area. Since standard serological methods are impractical and time-consuming in field conditions, we propose the rSP03B sero-strip—a rapid test that can be immediately applied to screen large cohorts of dogs for the presence of anti-P. perniciosus antibodies. Our test is the first rapid test in the field of vector exposure, it is highly sensitive and specific and shown to be a valid replacement for standard serological assays. In addition, this test could be used as an evaluation tool for vector control programs.
