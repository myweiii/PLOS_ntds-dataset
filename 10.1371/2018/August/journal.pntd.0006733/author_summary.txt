The number of people at risk for contracting Zika virus (ZIKV) is difficult to estimate accurately because most infected hosts are asymptomatic and the relationship between variation in host viremia and transmission to local mosquitoes is unclear. Controlling ZIKV transmission remains a major challenge due to lack of basic information on transmission mechanisms and gaps in mechanistic models. Therefore, our study highlights the importance of variation in viral concentration that current modeling efforts ignore, which will enhance our ability to predict the number of people at risk for arbovirus infection, overall disease transmission, and the efficacy of current and future intervention strategies. We demonstrated that increased concentration of ZIKV in the blood significantly increases the probability and the rate at which mosquitoes become infectious, which increases the risk of ZIKV transmission.
