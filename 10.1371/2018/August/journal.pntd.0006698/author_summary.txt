Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a highly pathogenic mosquito-borne virus responsible for outbreaks of severe disease in humans and equines, causing high mortality and neurological impairment in most survivors. In the past, human disease outbreaks in the northeastern United States occurred intermittently; however, recently, this region has experienced a recurring seasonal intensification of EEE virus activity with expansion into more northerly locales. Eastern equine encephalitis virus is maintained in a transmission cycle involving the ornithophilic mosquito, Culiseta melanura, and wild passerine birds in freshwater swamp foci. Recent studies on the blood feeding behavior of Cs. melanura suggest this mosquito species could also be involved in transmission of EEE virus to humans and equines. Since variation in host feeding of this mosquito vector may be a function of environmental factors and/or genetic differences among regional populations, we examined the population genetics of Cs. melanura in order to: 1) characterize the genetic diversity of Cs. melanura at EEE virus foci across eastern North America, 2) investigate the occurrence of genetic structure among populations of Cs. melanura, and 3) examine patterns of gene flow among these populations. We generated a draft genome of this species as a reference for population studies, identified evidence of significant genetic differentiation and fine-scale genetic structure among populations, and found evidence of gene flow among northeastern populations. This study provides the molecular basis for future investigations on the causes and consequences of the genomic variation in Cs. melanura on the risk of human and equine infection with EEE virus.
