Infectious diseases cause important health problems worldwide and create difficult challenges for public health policy makers. That is why they need reliable computational tools to better understand disease and to predict case counts. They will benefit from such computational tools to make more informed decisions in developing control and prevention strategies. We formulated a computational framework that can be used to model spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases. We showed the utility of our framework on the problem of modeling Crimeanâ€“Congo hemorrhagic fever in Turkey.
