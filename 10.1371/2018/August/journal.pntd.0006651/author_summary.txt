The implementation of schistosomiasis control/elimination strategies depend on accurate estimations and predictions of the changes in the snail and parasite population. This is essential especially in the allocation of limited resources. The simulation model and the results presented here provide useful information on Bulinus globosus, the main intermediate host snail of Schistosoma haematobium in southern Africa. The predicted changes in the abundance of B. globosus and S. haematobium due to changes in temperature may be vital in the fight against schistosomiasis. The model predicts the current and future abundance of intermediate hosts snails by considering the future predicted temperature increases. These results may be useful in evaluating the snail-trematode interactions within the natural systems in which changes in the environmental conditions such a temperature may affect the population size of Bulinus globosus and disease incidences. These effects of temperature on B. globosus may play an important role in the implementation of snail control programmes.
