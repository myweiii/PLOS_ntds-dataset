Dengue disease, transmitted through the bite of DENV infected mosquitoes, is an increasing health problem in the Asian subcontinent, including India. Dengue ranges from mild undifferentiated fever to circulatory shock and potentially death. Clinical disease gives an incomplete picture of the magnitude of dengue, because many infections are asymptomatic. Presence of antibodies to DENV provides evidence of past infection. This study provides the first estimate of the prevalence and incidence of dengue, based on the data collected from a well-designed, comprehensive serosurvey. By studying ageâ€“wise antibody prevalence, we estimated the force of DENV infection by applying a catalytic model to our serosurvey data. Over 81% individuals were positive for DENV antibodies suggesting intense DENV transmission in Pune city. We estimate that 8.68% of the susceptible population gets infected by DENV each year resulting into more than 3,00,000 infections and about 47,000 to 59,000 cases per year. The estimated seroprevalence at 9 years age (SP9), taken as benchmark for introduction of Dengvaxia vaccine by WHO, was 54.17% suggesting moderate transmission intensity of dengue, making introduction of the vaccine unsuitable in younger children.
