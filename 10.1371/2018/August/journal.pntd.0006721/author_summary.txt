A specific antivenom therapy is recommended for treating envenomation caused by venomous animals, such as snakes, spiders, scorpions, and Lonomia caterpillars. Studies with snake bites have shown that antivenoms are effective for treating the envenomation caused by snakes of the same genus, even when the antigen composition used to generate the antivenom did not include the specific venom. The Lonomia antivenom produced by the Butantan Institute to treat envenomations caused by contact with Lonomia caterpillars only uses the extract of Lonomia obliqua scoli as the antigen. However, there are reports of other species of Lonomia in South America that demonstrate biological activities that are different from those observed in response to L. obliqua venom, but which cause similar symptoms in human envenomation. No information is available regarding the neutralizing capacity of the Lonomia antivenom in these other species. This study showed that the Lonomia antivenom efficiently reversed the hemostatic disorders induced in rats by injection of extracts of the scoli of L. casanarensis and L. orientoandensis from Colombia. These results support the possibility of using this antivenom for treating envenomations caused by other Lonomia species in humans.
