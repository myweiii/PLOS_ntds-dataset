Dengue is currently a widespread viral disease transmitted to human by mosquitoes, with very high prevalence in tropical and subtropical regions of Am√©rica and Asia. Approximately 2.5 billion people are living in endemic areas and it is estimated that 350 million apparent and inapparent infections occur each year. There is no specific antiviral for treatment of dengue patients. On this basis, the search of antiviral agents is an urgent need. Dengue virus (DENV) entry is an attractive alternative for chemotherapeutic intervention since it represents a barrier to block the beginning of infection. We intended to evaluate the antiviral activity of diverse biochemical inhibitors of endocytosis against DENV in human myeloid cells. Results showed that DENV entry into these cells can be blocked by diverse biochemical inhibitors affecting the cellular factors involved in endocytosis such as intravesicular pH, clathrin-coated vesicles and dynamin, although the presence of non neutralizing antibodies, as can occur in secondary human infections, may alter the entry pathway under certain conditions. Then, the blockade of virus entry with host-targeted inhibitors may be a promising strategy for the development of safe antiviral agents with wide spectrum of activity against DENV and other related pathogenic flaviviruses.
