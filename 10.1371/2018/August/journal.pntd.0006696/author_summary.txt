In this study, we evaluate the probability or likelihood that tick-borne rickettsiae might be transmitted vertically from wild engorged adult female ticks collected throughout the Northern region of Mongolia during the summer of 2016. While significant effort has been directed to study tick-borne rickettsiae, this public health challenge is complicated by the limited knowledge and understanding of tick and tick-borne rickettsiae ecology within Mongolia. Tick-borne rickettsiae of concern to humans and animals in this region of the world are Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp., and Ehrlichia spp. Using molecular techniques, we detected rickettsiae among all Dermacentor spp. tick life stages and demonstrated potential vertical transmission of Rickettsia spp., and Anaplasma spp. among wild engorged adult female Dermacentor nuttalli ticks. We believe our findings provide important information regarding the ecology of key rickettsiae associated with tick-borne disease in Mongolia.
