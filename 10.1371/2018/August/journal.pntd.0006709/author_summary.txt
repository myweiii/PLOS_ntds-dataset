Triatomines are blood-sucking bugs that transmit Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease. Insecticide spraying has been very successful at controlling house-infesting bugs, but some triatomines have developed insecticide resistance. One alternative disease-control strategy involves modifying the genomes of bacteria living inside the bugs’ gut so that they produce T. cruzi-killing substances. An obvious requirement of this strategy is in-depth knowledge of the natural bacterial community (the ‘microbiota’) of the vectors’ gut. In this study, we evaluated bacterial diversity inside the guts of field-collected Triatoma sordida–a common pest in parts of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. We found that a ‘core’ set of 12 bacterium genera occur in both immature (five stages) and adult bugs (male and female), but also noticed changes in the gut’s microbiota through development. We finally investigated whether and to what degree the microbiota differed across the bugs’ three intestinal segments, and found clear variation. Our results will help pinpoint suitable candidates for genetic modification aimed at controlling T. cruzi inside T. sordida–that is, non-pathogenic bacteria that belong to the ‘core’ set and are easy to rear and maintain in the lab.
