In 2012, the roadmap for the Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) of the World Health Organization (WHO) included human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) to be eliminated as a public health problem by 2020. To reach this ambitious objective in Burkina Faso, where the vector (and consequently a risk of HAT re-emergence) is still present, a passive surveillance system based on sentinel sites was established in the southwestern part of the country, considered to be the most at-risk area. The implementation of this system recently resulted in the diagnosis of the first putative native sleeping sickness case since two decades. Although the origin of this infection and how the patient was infected could not be identified, the detection of this native case confirms that HAT re-emergence in Burkina Faso is still a risk. This demonstrates the importance of implementing, maintaining and reinforcing passive surveillance programs in at-risk areas.
