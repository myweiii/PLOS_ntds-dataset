Invasive strains of non-typhoidal salmonella (iNTS) are a common cause of bloodstream infection in Southeast Asia, however limited epidemiologic and antimicrobial resistance data are available and no population-based studies have been published from the region. We use nine years of bloodstream infections data from surveillance conducted in two Thai border provinces to report on the incidence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns. Incidence of iNTS was 5.1 cases/100,000 population (95% CI 4.7â€“5.6), likely an under estimate of the true burden of disease as we only used hospitalized cases and less sensitive blood culture for bacterial isolation. Levels of drug non-susceptibility were high among isolates, especially for fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin (~60%) and third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime or ceftazidime (~15%) that are commonly prescribed to provide empirical coverage against these pathogens. Multidrug resistance was widespread at 20% of isolates. Our data emphasizes the need for increased microbiological surveillance, and support the need for rational antibiotic therapy and the development of treatment guidelines.
