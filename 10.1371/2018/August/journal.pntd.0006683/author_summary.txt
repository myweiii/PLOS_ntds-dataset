Clonorchiasis is a neglected tropical disease. The major factor that prevents the effective management of clonorchiasis is a lack of effective diagnostic tools. Proteins containing tandem repeats (TRs), which have been found in a variety of parasites, are known targets of B-cell responses and can be useful for the serodiagnosis of parasite infections. Here we identified a novel C. sinensis-specific cDNA, which we named Cs1. This cDNA encodes a protein that has a unique structure, containing TRs and a signal peptide. A recombinant Cs1 protein (rCs1) was expressed and purified. rCs1 showed a high sensitivity and specificity in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and lower cross-reactivity with Paragonimus westermani compared with C. sinensis excretoryâ€“secretory products. Our results also indicated that the TR region was immunodominant in the Cs1 protein. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy revealed that Cs1 was located in a granule-like structure surrounding the acetabulum of adult worms that has not been previously described in C. sinensis. These results show that Cs1 is a promising antigen for serodiagnosis of clonorchiasis and its features provide a basis for future targeted screens of entire proteomes based on the likelihood of seroreactivity.
