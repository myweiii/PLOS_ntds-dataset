Tsetse flies are vectors for trypanosomes that cause both African sleeping sickness in humans and Nagana in animals. The reduction of tsetse populations is the most efficient way to reduce the prevalence of this economically important disease with current control methods including pesticide application, traps, and sterile insect techniques. Tsetse pregnancy and milk production represent a species-specific target for population control and milk gland transition during each larval growth cycle could represent a novel target for tsetse control. Within one day after birth, the milk gland organ, essential for provisioning nutrients to the intrauterine larva, undergoes involution marked by an ecdysone driven increase in autophagy that allows breakdown of this gland. Inhibiting the process of autophagy prevents the timely transition from the lactation phase to the dry phase, triggering a delay in subsequent pregnancy cycle. This misregulation of milk gland involution leads to an overall decrease in the number of offspring that each female can produce per lifetime. This study has determined the molecular components of this process, and reveals new targets of interference for vector control.
