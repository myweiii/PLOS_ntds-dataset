Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that can be caused by 4 viruses. It is a flu-like disease but can sometime be more severe and cause hemorrhage or death. An estimated 390 million people are infected every year, mainly in the Western Pacific and in South-East Asia. In Laos, where our study was conducted from 2006 to 2010, little was known on the circulation of the different dengue viruses. A total of 1,912 patients were recruited at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane (central Laos), 1,413 patients at Luang Namtha Provincial Hospital (northern Laos) and 555 at Salavan Provincial Hospital (southern Laos). Although most Dengue virus infections were detected during rainy seasons (where mosquitoes are the most active) in all three provinces, some patients were also infected during the dryer months. All 4 dengue viruses were detected with different distributions: mostly type 1 in the capital and in the South, and type 1 and 2 in equal proportion in the north. Type 3 and 4 were not detected in Luang Namtha and rarely in Salavan. Comparison of Dengue virus sequences from Laos with sequences collected worldwide showed an active year-round circulation of dengue within Laos and with neighboring countries. It is hence of great importance to develop and strengthen a year-round nation-wide surveillance network in order to collect data that would allow anticipation of public health issues caused by the occurrence of large dengue outbreaks.
