Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected tropical disease, affecting mostly marginated populations and there are no effective drugs or vaccines for prevention and/or treatment. Chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy is the mortal form of the disease; it affects 30% of infected patients and develops after 20â€“30 years of infection. We propose the development of a therapeutic vaccine to prevent disease progression. Our vaccine is based on the combination of two parasite proteins: Tc24 and TSA-1. In this study we assessed the response of mononuclear cells from Mexican Chagasic patients to the stimulation by both antigens. We found that both proteins are able to recall a secondary immune response, induced during natural infection in some patients, which is characterized by memory cells that can proliferate, differentiate and produce cytokines. We also showed that the immune response is associated with some of the histocompatibility allele supertypes specific of our study population. Our results support the further development and testing of both vaccine candidate antigens in future clinical trials.
