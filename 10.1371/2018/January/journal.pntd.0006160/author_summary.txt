Leishmaniases constitute a group of neglected parasitic diseases that inflict major burden on public health. Novel drugs and targets need to be identified since current therapies have adverse side effects. Herein, we focused on Leishmania infantum translation initiation factor 4A (LieIF), as a potential drug target. LieIF, a pivotal enzyme in the translation machinery, is also implicated in host-pathogen interactions. We modeled its 3D structure and identified two pockets, which were used in virtual screenings of a chemical compound library. Therefore, we selected and purchased 305 compounds. We established a reliable ATPase screening assay to test the molecules against the enzymatic activity of LieIF and its mammalian homologue. A promising hit was retained and further characterized. It inhibited both proteins but showed different kinetic properties. It was used as a basis to identify similar analogues and two additional inhibitors were identified. All three hits reduced the viability of the extracellular promastigote form of the parasite, but they had no significant cytotoxic effects on host cells. They also affected the viability of the intracellular amastigote form and reduced the macrophage infection. This selectivity is very promising and indicates that these inhibitors would constitute an avenue to develop strategies to fight leishmaniases.
