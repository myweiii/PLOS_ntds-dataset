Dengue is one of the most important arboviral infections in India, and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Control of dengue largely depends on effective vector control measures as no specific drugs or vaccines are available, to date. The knowledge of insecticide susceptibility status for local vector mosquitoes is essential for the formulation of effective vector control measures. Therefore, regular monitoring of insecticide susceptibility is essential for the early detection of resistance. In the present study, sensitive to moderate levels of resistance to temephos were recorded among the Aedes albopictus larval populations of different study sites. Adult Ae. albopictus were highly resistant to DDT and susceptible to deltamethrin and malathion in all the study sites, except one site where a low level of resistance to deltamethrin was observed. By sequencing the VGSC gene we observed that the studied Ae. albopictus population does not contain any of the important kdr mutations which are associated with DDT and pyrethroid resistance in other insects. We found only one non-synonymous mutation at codon S1485L, but its role in pyrethroid resistance is yet to be established.
