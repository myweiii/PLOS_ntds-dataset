Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness. Previous association studies have primarily assessed household-level exposures, ignoring potential community-level protection from water and sanitation coverage in neighboring houses. There is biological plausibility that increased community-level coverage of facial cleanliness and/or sanitation could reduce trachoma transmission, even to non-face washers or to those without access to sanitation. Our study investigates relationships between active trachoma and community-level coverage of sanitation and water, is novel in concept and unprecedented in scale, including data from trachoma-endemic areas of 13 countries. Our findings support the plausibility of community-level or herd protection from trachoma with increasing water and sanitation coverage. We also observed lower TF prevalence among those with household-level access to sanitation and water. Our results suggest access to adequate water and sanitation can be important components in working towards the 2020 target of eliminating trachoma as a public health problem.
