Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent that causes Chagas disease, has a complex life cycle, alternating between insects and mammals and thus facing environments with different metabolite compositions. T. cruzi can consume glucose and/or amino acids, depending on their availability. However, amino acid consumption produces excess ammonium, which must be eliminated in a non-toxic manner. Here, we show that the enzyme glutamine synthetase contributes to the management of excess ammonium and uses it to form the amino acid glutamine. During its life cycle, the parasite invades mammalian host cells and transiently becomes enclosed in a tight vacuole, where it differentiates into the amastigote, an amino acid consumer stage. Amastigotes must escape from the vacuole into the host-cell cytoplasm to initiate intracellular replication. In this work, we show that the inhibition of T. cruzi glutamine synthetase aborts parasite evasion from the vacuole. We propose that this enzyme contributes to the control of ammonium produced by parasite metabolism, as ammonium increases the internal pH of the parasitophorous vacuole, making the enzymes for the T. cruzi evasion process non-functional. This knowledge could be useful for designing new anti-T. cruzi drugs.
