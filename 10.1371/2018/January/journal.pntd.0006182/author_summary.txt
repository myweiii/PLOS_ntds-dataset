Rabies is one of the oldest known zoonoses, caused by lyssaviruses. In recent years, more than 21,000 nucleotide sequences for rabies viruses (RABV) have been deposited in public databases. In this study, a novel mathematical approach called affinity propagation (AP) clustering, a highly powerful tool, to verifiably divide full genome RABV sequences into genetic clusters, was used. A panel of existing and novel RABV full genome sequences was used to demonstrate the application of AP for RABV clustering. Using a combination of AP with established phylogenetic analyses is useful in resolving phylogenetic relationships between more objectively determined clusters and sequences. This workflow will help to substantiate a transparent cluster distribution, not only for RABV, but also for other comparative sequence analyses.
