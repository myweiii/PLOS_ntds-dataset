Thelazia callipaeda is the causative agent of thelaziasis canids, felids and humans. Despite the existing threat of thelaziosis in China, the genetic diversity of T. callipaeda has not been investigated across its wide geographical distribution in China, yet such information may provide insight into the disease epidemiology and the development of specific control measures. In this study, the genetic variation of 32 T. callipaeda clinical isolates collected from 13 patients from 11 geographical locations in China were explored using the following multi-molecular markers: cox1, cytb, 12S rDNA, ITS1 and 18S rDNA. In addition, the population structure of T. callipaeda from Europe and other Asian countries was analyzed using the cox1 sequences collected during this study and from the GenBank database. In general, the Chinese clinical isolates of T. callipaeda demonstrated high genetic diversity. Based on the cox1 gene, a total of 21 haplotypes were identified, one circulated in European countries (Hap1), while the other 20 haplotypes were dispersed in Korea, Japan and China. There were five nucleotide positions in the cox1 that were confirmed as invariable among individuals from Europe and Asia, but the sequences were distinct between these two regions. Population differences between Europe and Asian countries were greater than those among China, Korea and Japan, such that the T. callipaeda population from Europe and Asia should be divided into two separate sub-populations. These two groups started to diverge during the middle Pleistocene.
