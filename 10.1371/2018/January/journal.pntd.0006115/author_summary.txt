We aimed to understand what makes insecticide-treated curtains (ITCs) and residual insecticide treatment (RIT) with deltamethrin acceptable or not to users of these tools. In-depth interviews were conducted as part of a field trial conducted by the Cuban vector control program (AaCP) to test the effectiveness of these tools in Santiago de Cuba. Perceived efficacy was the main reason for interviewees who accepted the tools. Constraints linked to manufacturer instructions were the main reason for not using the ITCs when offered at the start of the trial. People stopped using the ITCs due to perceived allergy, toxicity and low efficacy. Few heads of households refused RIT despite identifying various reasons for rejection, such as allergy, health hazard and toxicity. Positive opinions of the Cuban vector control program influenced acceptability of both tools. On the contrary, perceptions of dengue risk did not appear to influence acceptability of ITCs or RIT. Our findings add on the importance of the growing body of qualitative research assessing acceptability of health interventions.
