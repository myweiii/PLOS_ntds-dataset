Although there are approximately 114 million infected people with Mansonella perstans, there is a paucity of information about how this filarial nematode affects the host's immune system. M. perstans currently poses a potential risk to 581 million people throughout Africa and for many years infections were considered to be nonpathogenic because individuals presented undefined and non-distinct clinical symptoms. Due to lack of treatment and the potential consequences on co-infections, M. perstans infections are however, regarded as a public health problem in endemic areas. The long-lasting co-existence of the worm with its human host implies potential immune-modulatory properties that may also affect responses to other infections; an aspect that has not been well addressed. In this study, we were interested in determining whether M. perstans-infected patients from Cameroon show a distinct immunological profile. In addition, we applied for the first time M. perstans worm antigen extract in order to test its re-stimulation capacity on cells isolated from M. perstans-microfilaremic individuals. Overall this study shows that M. perstans-microfilaremic individuals have a distinct immune profile, which is characterized by increased Th2 and regulatory cell populations concomitant with reduced systemic cytokine/chemokine and increased filarial-specific IgG4 levels. In addition, the M. perstans-specific down-regulation of immune responses might be an explanation for the increased susceptibility and worsened disease course of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria in M. perstans endemic regions.
