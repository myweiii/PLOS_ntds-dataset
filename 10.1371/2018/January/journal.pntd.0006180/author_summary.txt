Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite belonging to the Kinetoplastida class responsible for Chagas disease, a neglected tropical illness that affects an estimated 6 to 8 million people in Latin America and some Southern regions of the USA, with another 25 million at risk of acquiring the disease and a death toll of 12,000 every year. Commonly transmitted from the feces of the kissing bug, the disease is characterized by a nearly asymptomatic acute phase but a problematic chronic phase in which 20â€“30% of individuals develop serious cardiac and/or intestinal problems. The therapies currently in use were introduced more than forty years ago, and there are important concerns about adverse effects and lower effectiveness with disease progression. There is, therefore, an urgent need to find better alternatives. In this study, we evaluate the potential of a Trypanosoma cruzi sirtuin protein as a novel drug target and its inhibition by novel members of a known class of sirtuin compound inhibitors.
