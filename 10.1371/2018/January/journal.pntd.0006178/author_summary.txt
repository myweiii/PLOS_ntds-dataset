Trachoma is the worldâ€™s leading infectious cause of blindness. In light of a 2020 global target, the international trachoma community is intensifying its efforts to scale-up facial cleanliness and environmental improvement (F&E) components of the WHO-endorsed SAFE strategy for the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem. This is therefore an opportune moment to examine intervention content and delivery, and to consider their optimization. F&E interventions seek to change behaviors over the long term. Behavioral change and maintenance are predicated on behavioral antecedents, or precursors of change, and other determinants that may fall along different levels of influence. From the behavioral sciences literature, we know interventions are likely to be more effective if they target contextually-specific antecedents and causal determinants of behavioral change and maintenance. Evidence also suggests it is important to incorporate intervention techniques that are designed to address proximal change factors. However, F&E programming has largely focused on information dissemination via health and hygiene education, provision of water and sanitation facilities, and other interventions designed to address intermediate and distal behavioral factors. Intervention mapping and incorporation of techniques designed to address more proximal factors of behavioral change and maintenance have been deficient from F&E programming. Our review provides information regarding gaps in F&E intervention content and delivery that relevant stakeholders can use to understand why some interventions have not worked as intended, and strengthen F&E-related programming for trachoma elimination.
