Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-transmitted disease, which may affect animals (ruminants and camels) and cause severe disease. Egypt has been affected by RVF in the past, and it is considered at risk because of the importation of animals from endemic countries. We developed a map of the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors using current knowledge on the disease, and then combined it with animal trade data to identify the areas at the highest risk for RVFV introduction. Our results indicate that the main risk is posed by camels imported from Sudan, when they are transported to animal markets or slaughterhouses, which are generally located in areas where the risk of RVFV transmission is much higher. In fact many of them are located in the proximities or within the main cities, resulting in an increased risk of RVFV transmission to humans.
