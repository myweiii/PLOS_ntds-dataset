Emergomyces africanus is a recently described dimorphic fungus that causes a serious and often fatal disease in immunocompromised patients in South Africa. Infection is presumed to occur via inhalation of infectious propagules; however, no attempts have yet been made to detect this fungus in the air. We developed a highly specific and sensitive protocol for the molecular detection and quantification of Es. africanus, and tested air samples collected over a 50-week period from an urban area of Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa, where the disease is endemic. We detected Es. africanus in the air on 10% of all days sampled, suggesting that exposure to this fungus is common in this area. This study lays the groundwork for further investigations that might explore environmental, host, and pathogen factors that influence the development of this fungal disease.
