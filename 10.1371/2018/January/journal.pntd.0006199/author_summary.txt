Trypanosoma cruzi infection and strongyloidiasis are neglected tropical diseases, sharing a similar epidemiological burden in Latin America and producing life-long infections, leading to high morbidity and mortality. We conducted a case-control study in a non-endemic setting to evaluate a possible relationship between both infections. High prevalence of both diseases was found and importantly, T. cruzi infection was associated with a two-fold increase in the likelihood of strongyloidiasis even after adjusting for epidemiological variables. A possible explanation is that these two infections share an epidemiological burden where they are highly prevalent, but also the fact that both diseases are strongly influenced by socioeconomical factors such as soil contamination, barefoot walking or poor healthcare systems. Moreover, immune alterations produced by S. stercoralis may predispose to T. cruzi infection. As long as screening for Chagas disease in asymptomatic Latin American adults living in Europe has shown to be cost-effective and in light of the high prevalence of strongyloidiasis found in T. cruzi infected patients, a combined screening should be considered. The potential strongyloidiasis related complications and the benefits from ivermectin therapy are additional reasons to introduce systematic screening in susceptible populations.
