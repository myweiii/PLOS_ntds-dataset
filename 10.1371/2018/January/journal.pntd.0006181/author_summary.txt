Leprosy leads to low quality of life even after cure. The anaesthetic hands and feet leading to ulcers and deformities, stigma and poor mental health are just a few challenges. After declaration of leprosy elimination at global level, the research activities reduced significantly, and the health economics aspect was not an exception. The knowledge on economic burden of a disease helps in prioritization, policy making and advocacy. Our study is a step towards quantifying the economic burden of leprosy. Currently the aim is to eliminate leprosy at national level, therefore the countries need more information to plan high impact activities. Moreover, the patient’s perspective is important as they are the end-point recipients. Our study explores the patient’s financial burden due to leprosy (outpatient services), which is a significant indicator of a public health program’s success. If invested properly, the public health system has potential to reduce the economic burden of public health diseases. Our study is an attempt to link the patient’s perspective with the health system performance. This will help to encourage health systems strengthening.
