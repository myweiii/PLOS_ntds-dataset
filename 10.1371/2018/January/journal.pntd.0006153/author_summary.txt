Soil transmitted helminth infections (hookworms, Trichuris and Ascaris) are highly prevalent across south Asia and south east Asia and recently several large initiatives have been launched to control or interrupt transmission. We conducted a systematic review of STH infections to identify the communities in south Asia and south east Asia that will benefit the most from intervention programs. Our analysis showed that Ascaris is the most prevalent STH in the region but there was considerable geographic variation in the region. We found that tribal and rural communities in these countries had higher prevalence of STH compared to urban populations. We also found a higher prevalence of Ascaris and Trichuris in school aged children compared to the general population but comparable levels of hookworm infections. These key findings are important for future planning of intervention strategies for control of STH.
