In Ghana, the social interpretation of leprosy regardless of the language, culture and tradition engenders stigmatization and discrimination that leads to social rejection and exclusion of persons who have been cured of the disease. Often, these persons are cared for by relatives who happen to live with them in a confined place. From the views of these caregivers, this paper identifies areas of stigmatizing and discriminatory tendencies against people affected by leprosy who reside in a Leprosarium in Accra, the capital city. It is expected that persons suffering from such neglected tropical disease would be empowered to enable them go about their daily routines without the fear of being rejected. Besides, the intensification of public education about curing tendencies of stigma becomes paramount.
