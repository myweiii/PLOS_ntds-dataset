More than 2 billion people are infected with soil transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and schistosomiasis globally. In addition to deworming with albendazole and praziquantel, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) may be needed to reduce the risk of helminth reinfection and ultimately to break transmission. However evidence on the effectiveness of integrated deworming and WASH programs are mixed. Using data from a randomized controlled trial of deworming among HIV-infected adults in Kenya, we evaluated the associations between different potential packages of deworming and WASH interventions with helminth prevalence. We also aimed to understand if there was a benefit to accessing both WASH and deworming (i.e. synergy). Our findings indicate that deworming treatments were effective in reducing the probability of infection with most helminth species. Of the WASH conditions assessed, safe flooring and latrine access significantly reduced the probability of helminth infections among adults with access to treatment. However WASH may play a more prominent protective role among individuals without access to deworming treatments. These findings also suggest minimal synergistic benefit of coordinated anthelmintic chemotherapy and WASH in this population. These findings have important implications for adult populations who are currently not targeted by deworming campaigns.
