Previous systematic reviews of the effect of STH infection on cognitive and educational performance were either inconclusive or found little to no evidence of associated benefit. Lack of consensus in prior reviews and their narrow emphasis on randomized controlled trials prompted this comprehensive assessment of whether educational and cognitive benefits are associated with the common practice of preventive chemotherapy among children in STH-endemic regions. This literature synthesis included all relevant epidemiologic studies regardless of design and investigated associations between STH infections and two outcomes: i) educational loss (attendance and scholastic achievement) and ii) psychometrically performance in four neurocognitive domainsâ€”memory, learning, reaction time and intelligence. Pooled results across 36 observational and intervention studies suggest that STH infection/non-treatment is associated with deficits in five of six domains evaluated and provide evidence in support of a cognitive and educational benefit of deworming for STH infections. This overall finding was sensitive to study design and risk of bias across studies.
