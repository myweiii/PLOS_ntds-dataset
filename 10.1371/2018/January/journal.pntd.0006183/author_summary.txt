Cryptosporidiosis is an important cause of life-threatening diarrhea for young children and immunocompromised people, and Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the two main human Cryptosporidium pathogens, is also an important cause of diarrhea in dairy calves. Yet, there are no reliably effective drugs for treating cryptosporidiosis. Anti-Cryptosporidium drug development is complicated by the fact that infected rodents do not develop diarrhea. Here, a dairy calf model of cryptosporidiosis was used to demonstrate that the piperazine-based compound MMV665917, a compound identified within the open-access Medicines for Malaria Venture “Malaria Box”, reduces both diarrhea and parasite shedding when given once daily for seven days to dairy calves infected with C. parvum. These data establish MMV665917 as one of just several compounds with proven efficacy for treating dairy calves with cryptosporidiosis, and an outstanding lead to develop for humans.
