Plasmodium vivax is a major human malaria parasite, common in endemic areas outside sub-Saharan Africa, and more difficult to control than other malaria parasite species. The distinct lifecycle biology of P. vivax is thought to contribute to its more stable and efficient transmission allowing the maintenance of high diversity and potentially, gene flow. Independent studies are therefore needed to understand how P. vivax populations respond to changing transmission levels, in order to inform malaria control and elimination efforts. Here we have determined parasite population genetic structure in three countries of the Southwest Pacific, an island chain with a natural west to east decline in transmission intensity (Papua New Guinea > Solomon Islands > Vanuatu). With declining transmission, P. vivax populations experience only a modest decline in diversity but a significant increase in multilocus linkage disequilibrium and population structure, indicating that parasite populations become more inbred and begin to fragment into clustered foci. Analysis of two time points in one study area (Tetere, Solomon Islands) also show similar changes in association with intensifying malaria control. The results indicate that with long term sustained malaria control P. vivax populations will eventually fracture into population clusters that could be targeted for elimination.
