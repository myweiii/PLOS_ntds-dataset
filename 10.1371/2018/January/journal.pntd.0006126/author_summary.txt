Podoconiosis is a geochemical neglected tropical disease, which causes massive swelling of the lower legs and feet. Although podoconiosis is one of the major causes of lower leg swelling worldwide, understanding of the geographical distribution of the disease is incomplete. In Cameroon, few studies have been conducted, and these have indicated varied and localized distribution of the disease. We conducted this countrywide mapping survey to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon. We undertook nationwide mapping of podoconiosis in Cameroon by surveying 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households, in 76 communities. During the survey, individuals with lymphedema underwent a rapid-format antigen antibody test, and a thick blood film (TBF) for microscopic examination, as a confirmatory tool for detecting W. bancrofti micro filarial. Peripheral night blood and parasite DNA detection was used to exclude lymphatic filariasis, and a clinical history and physical examination was conducted to diagnosis podoconiosis. The overall prevalence of podoconiosis was found to be  0.5%. At least one case of podoconiosis was found in every region of Cameroon except Adamawa, where in the two surveyed villages no cases of podoconiosis were identified. Our investigation has demonstrated low prevalence but almost nationwide distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon. Designing a podoconiosis control program is a vital next step. A health system response to the burden of podoconiosis is important, through case surveillance and morbidity management services.
