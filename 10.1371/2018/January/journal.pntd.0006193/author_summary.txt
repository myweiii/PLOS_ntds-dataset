Burkholderia thailandensis is a non-pathogenic soil-dwelling bacterium and is genetically closely related to Burkholderia pseudomallei, the cause of melioidosis. In mouse models, inoculation of a variant of B. thailandensis which express a B. pseudomallei-like capsular polysaccharide (BTCV) induces antibodies and partial protection against melioidosis. Here, we evaluated the presence of B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis, and BTCV in 61 rice fields in Northeast, East and Central Thailand, determined whether they co-existed, and if their presence was associated with a serological response in farmers. We report the presence of BTCV in Thailand for the first time and describe the distribution of the three organisms. Co-localization between these organisms in the same rice fields was not uncommon. Our findings suggested that serological positivity based on the indirect hemagglutination assay (a test commonly used to detect antibodies to B. pseudomallei) in healthy rice farmers in Thailand was associated with exposure to B. pseudomallei, but not exposure to B. thailandensis or BTCV.
