Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are responsible for a growing number of infections in tropical and subtropical regions. DENV infection can cause dengue shock syndrome leading to death in some cases, while ZIKV is now linked with Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital anomalies including microcephaly. The protective and pathogenic roles played by the immune response in these infection is unknown. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a population of innate T cells with potent anti-bacterial activity. MAIT cells have also been postulated to play a role in the immune response to viral infections. In this study, we found that MAIT cells are activated in acute DENV infection and in vitro following ZIKV infection. MAIT cell IFNγ response to ZIKV infection was TCR independent, but IL-12 and IL-18 dependent. IFNγ produced from MAIT cells could help limit viral replication. Further studies are needed to determine the protective or pathogenic role of MAIT cells in Flavivirus infections.
