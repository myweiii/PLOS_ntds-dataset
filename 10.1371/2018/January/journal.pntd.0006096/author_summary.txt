Iron is an essential nutrient for many bacterial pathogens. A sufficient availability is linked to bacterial proliferation and pathogenicity. The host requires iron for cellular functions including innate immune defense mechanisms. Consequently, the control over iron homeostasis plays an important role in the course of infection. Burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental bacterium ubiquitous in soil and water surfaces causing the disease melioidosis with a wide range of signs and symptoms including localized, pulmonary, or bloodstream infections. Conditions with increased iron stores, such as thalassemia, are considered to increase the risk to acquire melioidosis. Here we show that infection with the pathogen triggers downregulation of the major cellular iron exporter inducing intracellular iron retention and stimulation of bacterial proliferation. Experimental iron overload appears to predispose to infection with B. pseudomallei, whereas iron deficiency confers relative resistance to melioidosis. These effects of changed iron metabolism on the course of infection may be ascribed to modifications in the host immune response and direct effects on bacterial growth, respectively. Thus, the B. pseudomallei-driven alteration of cellular iron traffic leading to increased iron availability can promote its intracellular growth, and treatment with iron chelators together with antibiotics might be an appropriate strategy to control infection.
