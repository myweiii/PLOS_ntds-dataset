Since May 2015, when Zika was first reported in Brazil, the virus has spread to over 60 countries and territories, and imported cases of Zika have been increasingly reported worldwide. However, there is still much uncertainty behind the mechanisms which dictated the rapid emergence of the epidemic. This work introduces a novel modeling framework to improve our understanding of the risk factors which contributed to the geographic spread and local transmission of Zika during the 2015-2016 epidemic in the Americas. The model is informed by data on regional socioeconomic factors, mosquito abundance, travel volumes, and epidemiological data. As expected, our results indicate that increased presence of mosquitoes, human hosts, and viruses increase the risk for mosquito-borne virus transmission. Passenger air travel, however, was less impactful, suggesting that travel restrictions will have minimal impact on controlling similar epidemics. Importantly, we found that a lower regional GDP was the best predictor of Zika virus transmission, suggesting that Zika is primarily a disease of poverty.
