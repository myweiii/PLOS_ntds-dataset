Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, known as encephalomyelitis, is a dangerous condition that can be caused by a wide range of pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, and other medical conditions including autoimmunity or drug intoxications. Given the many possible causes, it is often difficult for clinicians treating patients with encephalomyelitis to identify the underlying cause, which in turn determines the appropriate treatment. Infections and other diseases causing neurological inflammation work by distinct biological mechanisms and, consequently, can cause unique biochemical changes that can be observed in cerebrospinal fluid of affected individuals. The researchers used a metabolomics technique to measure a range of small molecules in cerebrospinal fluid and examine biochemical differences in patients with encephalomyelitis caused by Lyme disease, West Nile Virus, multiple sclerosis, rabies, or fungal infection. The researchers found distinct differences in the biochemical profiles of patients whose encephalomyelitis was caused by infections versus patients with no infection, and also identified different patterns among the individual diseases. This study showed that metabolomics may be useful in improving diagnosis and treatment of diseases affecting the central nervous system by enhancing understanding of their unique effects on metabolism.
