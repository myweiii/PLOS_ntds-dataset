Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the deadliest vector-borne parasitic disease after malaria worldwide and is one of the neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination and control by the World Health Organization. Despite the overall decrease in VL incidence in Bihar, India, a region previously highly endemic for VL, there remain hotspots of cases for reasons that are poorly understood. This study demonstrates clear spatiotemporal heterogeneity of VL in an area of ~100,000 population in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, India between 2007–2015. Identified hotspots occurred almost always in the poorest communities, confirming that VL is a disease of ‘the poorest of the poor’. Our finding that older age groups (35+ years) are at a comparable high risk for VL within hotspots, similar to the 5–14 years highest risk group, but not outside hotspots, suggests a potential role of waning immunity as driver of hotspots. To further understand the drivers and transmission dynamics underlying VL hotspots, and ultimately inform policy, additional longitudinal data are needed to understand more about the role of asymptomatic infections, human movement, sand fly distribution and immunity. Including hotspots in mathematical transmission models is relevant for predicting the feasibility of reaching and sustaining VL elimination at a smaller geographical scale.
