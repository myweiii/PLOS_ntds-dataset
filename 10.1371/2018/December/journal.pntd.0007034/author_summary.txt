Most of the scientific literature about statistical thresholds for outbreak detection is biased toward large datasets that derive from wealthy countries. In the scientific community, it is acknowledged that even objectively determined statistical thresholds can produce varied results when applied to the same dataset, but to date, no study has evaluated thresholds for rare but endemic diseases such as monkeypox. We applied three statistical thresholds to a monkeypox surveillance dataset from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to identify periods of elevated disease incidence. Each threshold produced markedly different results in terms of the number of aberrant months detected. We conclude that thresholds alone are insufficient to determine when a public health response should be triggered to monkeypox, and instead propose a novel algorithm that combines the use of an objective threshold with contextual information about social and epidemiological links between cases. Similar approaches could be valuable when applied to other, rare tropical infectious diseases where data are limited.
