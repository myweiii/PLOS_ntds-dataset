Intestinal helminth infections affect approximately one-third of the worldâ€™s population, particularly in developing countries. Paradoxically, drug development in this area has been delayed for years. In addition, resistance to currently available drugs is also an emerging global concern. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new and effective anthelmintics. In this work, we used C. elegans as a model for parasitic nematodes to screen the anthelmintic activity of several imidazole-derivative compounds. We found a compound, diisopropylphenyl-imidazole (DII), that is lethal to both mature and immature stages of C. elegans. The DII nematicidal mechanism of action depends on a novel UNC-29-containing AChR in adult C. elegans muscle. Since this mechanism is different from those of currently used anthelmintics, it could constitute a therapeutic option when traditional anthelmintic agents fail. In addition, we found that the DII larvicidal effect depends on a different target to that of adult stages. The fact that DII produces lethality through different targets may delay resistance development. The specificity and novel mode of action of DII, which includes differential targeting in larvae and adult nematodes, support its potential as a promising drug candidate to treat helminthiasis.
