The potency of rabies vaccine is demonstrated by the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in serum. It is critical to evaluate immunologic status of individuals who work directly with rabies virus (RABV) (laboratorians) or at high risk of infection due to interaction with animals (veterinarians and animal control workers). In addition, rabies vaccination records and demonstration of VNAs in animals are mandatory before initiating pet travel to rabies-free counties or regions. Rabies VNAs are currently determined by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) and the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test, which measure the ability of antibodies to bind and prevent infection of RABV in vitro. Both assays require staining of infected cells using anti-rabies antibodies and manual observation of infected cells by a fluorescent microscope to determine VNA titers. In this study, we have developed a GFP reporter-based high throughput neutralization test (HTNT) for automated quantification of infected cells. This method has the advantages of allowing investigators to analyze and store the results, and can accommodate large sample sizes. Overall, the results from HTNT exhibited 100% correlation with that of RFFIT, albeit with differences in rabies VNA titer values due to quantification methods.
