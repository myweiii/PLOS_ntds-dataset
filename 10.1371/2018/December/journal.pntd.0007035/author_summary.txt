Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) reaction is a severe multisystem immune-mediated complication of lepromatous and borderline leprosy. It causes high morbidity and mortality and usually requires urgent medical attention. Although thalidomide is an effective drug for ENL treatment, it is not available in many leprosy endemic countries including Ethiopia. Prednisolone is widely used for treatment of ENL reactions but its efficacy is less than 40%. As a result, patients with ENL reactions receive Prednisolone for prolonged periods. However, it has been reported that prolonged treatment with prednisolone increases the risk for prednisolone-induced complications such as osteoporosis, diabetes, cataract and arteriosclerosis. It has been hypothesized that perhaps these complications result from changes in lipid concentration due to prednisolone. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine changes in lipid profiles in patients with ENL reactions. We found that prednisolone treatment not only alters lipid concentrations in patients with ENL reactions but also reduced the antibody responses to M. leprae antigens. Our result has shown that prednisolone treatment has increased low and high lipoproteins in patients with ENL reactions. We also found that use of prednisolone for prolonged time in chronic ENL was correlated with increased triglycerides (TG) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) showing the need for monitoring lipid profiles during prednisolone treatment of these patients to avoid the risks associated with increased TG and HDL such as diabetes and hypertension.
