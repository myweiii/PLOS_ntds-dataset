Snakebite is a public health issue that causes life-threatening medical emergencies. Rapid diagnosis of snakebite in the clinic is a critical necessity in many tropical and subtropical countries, where various venomous snakes are common. Venoms from different snake species contain distinct protein components that require treatment with different antivenoms. However, given the similarity in clinical symptoms among some snake envenomations, it is often challenging for physicians to precisely define the snake species responsible for envenomation. Thus, a reliable method or assay for rapidly diagnosing envenoming species is urgently needed. Here, we present a two-step affinity purification procedure for generating species-specific antibodies (SSAbs) from antivenom, followed by the development of a sandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and lateral flow strip assay using these SSAbs. This feasible and cost-effective strategy allowed us to develop workable assays for distinguishing between venom proteins from hemorrhagic and neurotoxic snakes in Taiwan. The usefulness of this strategy was demonstrated in the clinic, where both diagnostic assays were shown capable of detecting venoms in blood samples from snakebite patients. Together with the observation of clinical symptoms, the two-test-line lateral flow strip assay is potentially applicable in an emergency room setting to improve snakebite diagnosis and management.
