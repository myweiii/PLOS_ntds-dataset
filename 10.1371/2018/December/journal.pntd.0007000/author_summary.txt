Schistosomiasis is a global health concern that affects primarily tropical and subtropical areas. During a schistosome infection, the eggs are trapped in the host liver and products derived from eggs induce a polarized Th2 response, resulting in granuloma formation and eventually fibrosis. Thus, it is important to elucidate the mechanism of granuloma formation and fibrosis development. Here, we show that activated macrophages play a novel role in the promotion of hepatic granuloma formation and liver fibrosis in a Schistosoma japonicum-infected mouse model. In addition, M2b polarization induced by egg products was dependent on enhanced NF-ÎºB signaling mediated by the MyD88/MAPK pathway in a TLR2-dependent manner. Our findings reveal a novel role and mechanism of M2b polarization in the liver pathogenesis in S. japonicum-infected mice.
