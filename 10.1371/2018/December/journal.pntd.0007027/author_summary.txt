Trachoma is a disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct). Validation of elimination of trachoma as a public health problem is based on clinical indicators. Antibody and infection data may provide a better understanding of transmission dynamics in elimination settings. Dried blood spots (DBSs) for antibody testing and ocular swabs for Ct infection testing were integrated into the pre-validation trachoma surveys conducted in the Northern and Upper West regions of Ghana in 2015 and 2016. Ct infection was detected using the GeneXpert PCR platform and the presence of anti-Ct antibodies were detected using both the ELISA and multiplex bead array (MBA). Very little infection was identified (0.04%). The conclusions from the ELISA and MBA testing were similar, with evidence of an association between increasing seroprevalence and age in 1-9-year olds. Infection and serological data provide useful insights into transmission dynamics. Even if an EU meets trachoma elimination targets, this may not reflect complete interruption of transmission of ocular Ct infection.
