In recent decades mosquito-borne viruses have reached and adapted to new habitats, and now they can be found in nearly all continents. Facilitated goods transportation, live stock exchange, people travelling more easily, and most importantly world climate alterations, might be some of the reasons for this mosquito habitat spreading. Emergence of WNV in North America, Europe, and most Mediterranean countries like Turkey, Greece and Israel is evidence of this spreading. Furthermore, emergence and re-emergence of some of these mosquito borne viruses in new areas may be accompanied with changes in their pre-known pathogenesis. Re-emergence of ZIKV in the South Pacific and America from 2007 to 2016 was accompanied with an increase in neurovirulent diseases and congenital malformations. In this study, we evaluated the presence of WNV and ZIKV via serological and genome detection in human samples and mosquitoes (viral genome analysis) from southern Iran. This region is on the coast with a warm and tropical climate suitable for inhabitation and expansion of the vectors harboring these two viruses. We caught a large spectrum of mosquitoes from these areas. After classification, we analyzed the mosquitoes’ pools for WNV and ZIKV genomic RNA. Our results showed that 20.6% of the studied human samples were IgG reactive to WNV while no antibodies against ZIKV were detected. We found WNV RNA genome in three mosquitoes’ pools. The genomic analysis was negative for ZIKV in both human and mosquito samples. Based on the results WNV is notably circulating in southern Iran; while no evidence of ZIKV infection in people or circulation in any of the vectors was observed.
