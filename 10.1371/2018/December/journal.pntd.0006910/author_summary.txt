After the introduction of effective therapy for leprosy by the world health organization in early eighties, there has been a marked reduction in new case detection all over the world. Despite the decline in case detection of leprosy, incidence reduction to zero and suppression of infection source is still not possible. Addressed strategies to high-risk groupsâ€“contacts of leprosy cases- may be effective to eliminate the disease at global level. Chemoprophylaxis in contacts may lower the incidence of leprosy in contacts of patients diagnosed with leprosy. In Morocco, chemoprophylaxis was introduced at national level in 2012. Morocco has achieved the goal of leprosy elimination as a public health problem in 1991 and the declining trend of leprosy detection is observed years after years. However, no study has been conducted in the country to analyze whether the declining trend of leprosy can be related or not to chemoprophylaxis in contact. This time series can be of interest for medical community as the authors analyses the trend in leprosy in the last 17 years and try to generate a hypothesis about any relationship with chemoprophylaxis implementation.
