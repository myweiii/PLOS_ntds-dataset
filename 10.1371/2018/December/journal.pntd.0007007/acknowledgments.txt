We are grateful to the owners of the homes where the studies took place for allowing us access to their properties and to the Centro de Controle de Zoonoses (CCZ) for giving us permission to carry out this study in Governador Valadares. We are also grateful to Dr. Krishna Kumari Bandi for synthesis of the sand fly sex/aggregation pheromone.
