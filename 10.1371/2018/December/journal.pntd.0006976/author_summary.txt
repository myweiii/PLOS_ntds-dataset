Animal diseases that infect humans are a major threat to human health. Nonhuman primatesâ€™ genetic relatedness to human beings makes them an important source of disease spillovers into human populations. The central African rainforest has witnessed many infectious spillovers from primates, including multiple neglected tropical diseases. Previous studies have focused on hunting and butchering of primates as risky practices that expose central Africans to their diseases. These studies have not investigated how different kinds and frequencies of contact or the abundance of different monkey and great ape species affect these risks. We examined these factors in southeastern Cameroon, conducting a social sciences study of human physical contacts with nine different primate species. We found that Cameroonian adults had frequent physical contact with primates, and more with monkeys than apes, especially through handling meat for butchering, marketing, and preparation. People also had more contact with more abundant primate species living closer to villages. National and international authorities should support improved surveillance of humans and abundant monkey species, as well as popular messages to promote safe meat handling practices. Multidisciplinary social science and ecological approaches should be used to improve surveillance and communications with forest populations about neglected tropical diseases.
