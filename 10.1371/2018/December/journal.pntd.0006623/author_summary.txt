Trachoma and Guinea Worm Disease (GWD) are neglected tropical diseases slated for elimination as a public health problem and eradication respectively by the World Health Organization. As these programs wind down, uncovering the last cases becomes an urgent priority in order to confirm that eradiation and elimination targets have been reached. Active case searches are one method of finding these last vestiges of disease. Searches that look for multiple diseases are referred to as integrated searches. We piloted here integrated house-to-house case searches for GWD and Trachoma with two case management strategies; a referral approach to a central location and a point of care approach (POC)–offering services at the household or ‘point of care’ location. POC approaches can be difficult to implement in low resource settings because they require extensive personnel, financial commitment, and logistical support. However, POC approaches remove one of the biggest barriers to treatment, time spent traveling to a health center, and thus can improve treatment acceptance. We found here that integrated active case searches with a POC case management approach can be implemented in a low resource setting; and improve acceptance and uptake of trachoma examination and trichiasis surgery respectively, without costing much more than a referral-based case management approach.
