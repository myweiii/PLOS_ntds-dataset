Mechanisms of acquired immune response against Trypanosoma cruzi antigens include both humoral and cellular components that might be critical in a chronic infection. Through a vast number of studies, several groups have postulated that, similar to other chronic infections, T-cell responses in chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection are driven to exhaustion. Alterations in T-cell signaling pathways have emerged as one of the mechanisms of immune exhaustion. Here, we investigated whether the ability of T cells to secrete IFN-γ in response to T. cruzi was linked to the expression and function of the IL-7 receptor and the cytokines involved in regulating this axis in patients with different clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease. This study showed that the ability of T cells to secrete IFN-γ in response to T. cruzi is linked to an efficient modulation and function of IL-7R and low levels of inflammatory cytokines. Low IFN-γ-ELISPOT responses could not be reverted by in vitro treatment with IL-7. These findings contribute to our understanding of the long-term consequences of T. cruzi-infection and might be useful to delineate novel therapeutic strategies.
