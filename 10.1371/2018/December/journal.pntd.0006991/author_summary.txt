Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with the rise of microcephaly cases observed in Northeast Brazil at the end of 2015. For women in endemic or at-risk areas, understanding how the relationship between time of infection and microcephaly risk varies through pregnancy is important in informing family planning. However, a relatively modest number of congenital Zika syndrome cases have been observed following subsequent waves of ZIKV infection, limiting our understanding of gestational risk. We used a mathematical model to quantify the shape and magnitude of the gestational-age-varying risk to a fetus. Although the risk profile should be conserved regardless of location, we estimated different profiles when using surveillance data from locations in Northeast Brazil and Colombia. Our results suggest that time-dependent reporting changes likely confound the interpretation of currently available surveillance data. Furthermore, we investigated a range of behavioural and reporting rate changes that could explain two waves of ZIKV infection in Bahia, Brazil despite only one wave of microcephaly. Plausible changes in reporting could explain these data whilst remaining consistent with the hypothesis that ZIKV infection carries a significant risk of microcephaly. Further evidence is needed to disentangle the true risk of congenital Zika syndrome from time-varying reporting changes.
