Yaws is a disabling and disfiguring disease. When the World Health Organization (WHO) was established in 1948, yaws was among the major public health problems that the new health agency chose to prioritize. In 2013, it formally targeted yaws for global eradication. While only 14 Member States currently report cases to WHO, many more are known to have a history of yaws and some of them may have ongoing transmission. Eradication requires certification that all countries are free of yaws. Certification, in turn, requires surveillanceâ€“and in some settings this may require population surveys or purposive case search. We reviewed the historical literature and developed a statistical model to better understand what factors were associated with some countries not reporting cases despite (likely) ongoing transmission. There are at least 86 countries or areas that stopped reporting cases but where yaws may still be present. Our model identified socioeconomic development and independence as factors associated with case reporting. Within the large and diverse group of countries with a history of yaws, we have identified a group of 20 countries with more than a 50% probability of reporting cases in the absence of active surveillance. For the other 66 countries, international support for active surveillance will likely be required.
