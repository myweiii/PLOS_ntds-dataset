We acknowledge the invaluable role of chief medical officers and epidemiologists of the health zones of Kinshasa, Kongo Central and Kwango provinces, who reported suspected YF cases, spent long days investigating cases, and mobilized their communities for vector control activities. We thank Dr. Kostas Danis for final edits to the manuscript.
