Almost half of the world population is at risk of a dengue infection. Although dengue often presents annual transmission seasonality (peaking during the summer) and features epidemics occuring between multi-year interepidemic intervals, little is known about how the epidemiology and determinants of dengue vary seasonally and during different stages of the epidemic cycle. As a result, control efforts likely neglect factors that sustain transmission between epidemics, or that set epidemics in motion. Using five years of monthly data at fine spatial scale from the 5th largest city in Brazil, we observed that dengue epidemiology in interepidemic years deviates from the common pattern, showing a much longer and sustained transmission season. Occurrence of violence was a strong and consistent predictor of high dengue incidence, while specific areas in the city (e.g. with a high concentration of scrapyards and locations used for tire storage) were critical during transitional precipitation periods. Indicators of social deprivation were only correlated with dengue incidence during periods of low transmission, suggesting that practices typifying these areas–such as water storage–may extend viremic circulation during dry seasons. These findings can be translated into revised and better strategies of control, but also call for the need to better understand how variations in the epidemiology of dengue may affect the success of current control recommendations.
