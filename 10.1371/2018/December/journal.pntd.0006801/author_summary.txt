Non-human primates are our closest relatives and with them we share many of our disease-causing pathogens. Malaria is one such example where the parasite (Plasmodium) causing malaria in humans has originated from non-human primate populations. To understand origin and evolution of human malaria parasites it is important to know the diversity and evolutionary relationships of these parasites in non-human primates. In this study we report the molecular data for malaria parasites from wild populations of Indian non-human primates. We surveyed 349 fecal samples from five different Indian non-human primates, while 94 blood and tissue samples from one of the Indian non-human primate species (Macaca radiata). Our results confirm the presence of P. fragile, P. inui and P. cynomolgi in Macaca radiata. Additionally, we report for the first time the presence of human malarial parasite, P. falciparum, in M. mulatta and M. radiata.
