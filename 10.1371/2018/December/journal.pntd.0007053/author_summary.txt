Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flaviviral infection that causes significant clinical disease. It is estimated that approximately one half of the worldâ€™s population is at risk for ZIKV infection. There are only a limited number of studies describing the human immune response to ZIKV infection. Carlin et al. combined conventional and genomic approaches to longitudinally analyze the innate and adaptive immune responses to acute ZIKV infection and its resolution in a person who was infected while traveling in Venezuela during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic year. Genome-wide sequencing in individual cell types revealed that although many populations respond to interferon stimulation, only specific cell populations within peripheral blood mononuclear cells upregulate important inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Additionally, analysis of open chromatin using ATAC-seq suggests that chromatin remodeling at sites containing cell-type specific transcription factor binding motifs may help us understand changes in gene expression. Consistent with previous reports, this individual with prior exposure to dengue virus (DENV), rapidly developed neutralizing anti-ZIKV responses that were cross-reactive with multiple DENV serotypes. Collectively this study combines traditional and genomic approaches to characterize the cell-type specific development of an in vivo human immune response to acute ZIKV infection.
