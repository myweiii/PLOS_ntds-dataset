Arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses are notorious for causing unpredictable and large-scale epidemics and epizootics. Apart from viruses such as West Nile virus and Rift Valley fever virus that are well known to have a significant impact on human and animal health, many arboviruses remain neglected. Shuni virus (SHUV) is a neglected virus with zoonotic potential that was recently associated with severe disease in livestock and wildlife. Isolations of SHUV from field-collected biting midges and mosquitoes suggests that SHUV may be transmitted by these insects. Laboratory-reared biting midge species (Culicoides nubeculosus and C. sonorensis) and mosquito species (Culex pipiens pipiens and Aedes aegypti), that are known to transmit other arboviruses, were exposed to SHUV via an infectious blood meal. SHUV was able to successfully disseminate in both biting midge species, whereas no evidence of infection or transmission in both mosquito species was found. Our results show that SHUV infects and disseminates in two different Culicoides species, suggesting that these insects could play an important role in the disease transmission cycle.
