Variation in infectious disease risk between groups of individuals represent health inequalities: reducing these inequalities, alongside reductions in infection prevalence, is a major focus for public health interventions. Despite this, it is rare that general contextual effects, or measures of within-group correlation or between-group heterogeneity, are reported as substantive outcomes from community-based studies of infectious disease risk, including for the NTDs. This reflects wider issues around a lack of social epidemiological perspectives, or consideration of the effects of contextual drivers, in communicable disease research, particularly in low-income settings. The aim of this study was to measure general contextual effects on human infection risk for a number of endemic helminth, protozoal, bacterial and viral pathogens in a rural farming community in western Kenya. Using this approach, we reveal clustering at a range of administrative and geographic levels and are able to show that the magnitude of clustering, and the hierarchical grouping level at which it occurs (from the household to administrative constituency), varies substantially between pathogens. Greater within-group correlation and between-group heterogeneity in infection risk was observed for the helminth NTDs and HIV than for Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Plasmodium falciparum or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Quantification of general contextual effects can inform the design of interventions that aim to reduce health inequalities within a population and can provide actionable targets for assessing the short- and long-term impact of interventions.
