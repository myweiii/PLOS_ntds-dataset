The reliable, portable, point-of-care DPP assay effectively discriminates case status for patients presenting to hospital with acute febrile syndromes consistent with classic leptospirosis. Diagnostic accuracy of the finger stick DPP using the initial acute-phase specimen at the bedside is similar to serum DPP and IgM-ELISA, yet diagnosticians can perform the DDP assay in 20 minutes without laboratory equipment. The finger stick DPP expands rapid diagnostic options at the bedside for severe leptospirosis in humans.
