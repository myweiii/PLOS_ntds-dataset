Melioidosis is a tropical infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei. Disease ranges from mild to lethal, and patients who die from melioidosis have greater inflammatory responses than survivors. Identifying variation in bacterial structures that alter the immune response is therefore important. B. pseudomallei expresses lipopolysaccharide, a major stimulator of the immune response. Studies of other bacteria suggest that differences in the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide result in variable stimulation of the immune system. In this study, we analyzed the chemical structure of lipid A of 171 clinical B. pseudomallei isolates, structural changes caused by different growth conditions, and innate immune responses induced. Surprisingly, we did not observe any variation of lipid A structure or different innate immune activation from different B. pseudomallei isolates. Our data suggest that lipid A structure of B. pseudomallei is highly conserved and that different inflammatory responses in patients may be caused by other factors.
