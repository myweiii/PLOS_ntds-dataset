Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) occurs in two distinct disease forms; the acute form and the chronic form which are caused by microscopically indistinguishable hemo-parasites, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense respectively. Uganda is the only country where both forms of the disease are found, though in geographically distinct areas. Recent studies have shown that host genetic factors play a role in HAT resistance and/or susceptibility, particularly by genes involved in the immune response. In this study, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected genes involved in immune responses and carried out a case-control candidate gene association study in Ugandan participants from the two endemic areas. We were unable to detect any polymorphisms that were robustly associated with either Tbr or Tbg HAT. However, our findings differ from recent studies carried out in the Tbr HAT another endemic area of Uganda that showed the APOL1 (Apolipoprotein 1) G2 allele to be protective against the disease which merits further investigation. Larger studies such as genome wide association studies (GWAS) by the TrypanoGEN network that has >3000 cases and controls covering seven countries (Cameroon, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, DRC, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia) using the H3Africa customized chip reflective of African genetic diversity will present novel association targets (https://commonfund.nih.gov/globalhealth/h3aresources).
