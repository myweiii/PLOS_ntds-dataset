The main agent causing localized cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Guianan Ecoregion Complex, a region that covers Guiana, Suriname, French Guiana, the southern portion of Venezuela and the northern portion of the Amazon Basin, is Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis. The current treatment regimens for treating this parasite follow a weak strength of recommendation based on a low-quality evidence. All the drugs used are parenteral drugs with low therapeutic indexes and inadequate cure rates. Azoles are drugs that interfere with the production of leishmanial ergosterol and have been studied in other Leishmania species with promising results. Fluconazole is a hydrophilic bis-triazole that accumulates rapidly and extensively in the skin with a low toxicity profile. It is considered safe for children. Oral fluconazole is readily available and has a reasonable cost. In this work, we estimated the efficacy of fluconazole in treating localized cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. guyanensis in Manaus. The study had to be stopped due to the disappointing results, with only a 5% cure rate. Among the failures, 55% developed a marked worsening of their ulcers and 55% of those patients had lymphatic dissemination of the infection. In conclusion, fluconazole at the dose of 450mg per day is not efficacious in treating localized cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. guyanensis.
