Mass drug administration (MDA) with antibiotics is a key component of the trachoma control strategy. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that at least 80% of the target population should be reached with MDA. Drug coverage estimates from population-based surveys may increase our understanding of factors affecting the effectiveness of MDA. We conducted a region-wide population-based survey to estimate the prevalence of self-reported drug coverage in all ten administrative zones of Amhara region, an area with a population of approximately 21 million people. The self-reported drug coverage was greater than 80% in five of the ten zones and was 76.8% region-wide. Zonal administrative coverage reports were greater than 90% and were considerably higher than self-reported coverage in all zones. The discrepancy between administrative and self-report coverages also suggest that efforts should be made to better understand the reasons for the disparity in the two measures. The main reasons reported for not attending the MDA included being physically unable to get to the distribution site, traveling during the campaign, and lack of knowledge about the campaign. These findings suggest that making the distribution site accessible to all individuals, informing constituents about timing of the campaign to allow for travel, and providing adequate information about the campaign would improve MDA participation.
