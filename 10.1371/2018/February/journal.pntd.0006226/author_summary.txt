Chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection. In this study, we sought to identify a simple serologic biomarker that can supersede PCR techniques in characterizing patients for parasite persistence, whether circulating or shielding in tissues. A multiparametric assay was designed to evaluate antibody diversity in untreated and benznidazole-treated chronic cardiomyopathy patients. Out of 15 different antigens we identified a distinct antibody specificity that strongly correlates with parasite persistence. This putative biomarker could be used to monitor active infection in T. cruzi seropositive patients and identify patients that responded to anti-parasitic therapy.
