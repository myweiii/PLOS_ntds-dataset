Fleas are known vectors of human infectious diseases. Identification of fleas and their associated pathogens is essential for the prevention of flea-borne diseases. Currently, the morphological identification of arthropods based on dichotomous keys, as well as molecular techniques, are the most common approaches for arthropod identification and entomological surveillance. In recent years, MALDI-TOF MS has revolutionized clinical microbiology in enabling the rapid identification of bacteria and fungi by comparing the protein profiles obtained to a database. This proteomic approach has recently been used for arthropod identification and pathogen detection. Here, we developed an experimental model to test MALDI-TOF's ability to differentiate fleas infected with human pathogens, Bartonella quintana and Bartonella henselae, from uninfected fleas.
