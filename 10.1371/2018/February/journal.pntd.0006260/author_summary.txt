Southeast Asian Countries are endemic for several foodborne and soil-transmitted helminths occurring in different levels and areas, depending on environmental and cultural conditions. This study aimed to study the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) and foodborne parasites in Savannakhet Province of Lao PDR, bordering with Vietnam. We found people infected with hookworms, roundworms, whipworms, intestinal/liver flukes, and tapeworms. We also detected antibodies against cysticercosis, an infection caused by eating the eggs of Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm. Focusing on human tapeworm infection, using molecular techniques based on mitochondrial DNA, we detected the three species of human tapeworms T. solium, T. saginata and T. asiatica. Interestingly, when we checked the same material using nuclear gene markers we noted that T. asiatica found in the region were the hybrid descendants of T. saginata and T. asiatica. The causes of hybridization may include people harboring different tapewormâ€™s species at the same time, allowing the exchange of genetic material but, the consequences of this hybridization are unknown including the seriousness of disease in people. Despite the deworming programs, there is a high prevalence of STHs and foodborne parasites in east Savannakhet area, therefore wide and sustainable health programs are an urgent task to improve the quality of life of the people living in the area.
