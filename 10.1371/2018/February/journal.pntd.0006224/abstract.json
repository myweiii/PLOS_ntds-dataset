    "Abstract": "Enteropathies such as Crohn\u2019s disease are associated with enteric inflammation characterized by impaired TGF-\u03b2 signaling, decreased expression of phosphorylated (p)-SMAD2,3 and increased expression of SMAD7 (an inhibitor of SMAD3 phosphorylation). Environmental enteropathy (EE) is an acquired inflammatory disease of the small intestine (SI), which is associated with linear growth disruption, cognitive deficits, and reduced oral vaccine responsiveness in children <5 y in resource-poor countries. We aimed to characterize EE inflammatory pathways by determining SMAD7 and p-SMAD2,3 levels (using Western blotting) in EE duodenal biopsies (N = 19 children, 7 from Pakistan, 12 from Zambia) and comparing these with healthy controls (Ctl) and celiac disease (CD) patients from Italy. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots showed that EE SI biopsies expressed higher levels of both SMAD7 (mean\u00b1SD in arbitrary units [a.u.], Ctl = 0.47\u00b10.20 a.u., EE = 1.13\u00b10.25 a.u., p-value = 0.03) and p-SMAD2,3 (mean\u00b1SD, Ctl = 0.38\u00b10.14 a.u., EE = 0.60\u00b10.10 a.u., p-value = 0.03). Immunohistochemistry showed that, in EE, SMAD7 is expressed in both the epithelium and in mononuclear cells of the lamina propria (LP). In contrast, p-SMAD3 in EE is expressed much more prominently in epithelial cells than in the LP. The high SMAD7 immunoreactivity and lack of p-SMAD3 expression in the LP suggests defective TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the LP in EE similar to a previously reported SMAD7-mediated inflammatory pathway in refractory CD and Crohn\u2019s disease. However, Western blot densitometry showed elevated p-SMAD2,3 levels in EE, possibly suggesting a different inflammatory pathway than Crohn\u2019s disease but more likely reflecting cumulative protein expression from across all compartments of the mucosa as opposed to the LP alone. Further studies are needed to substantiate these preliminary results and to illustrate the relationship between SMAD proteins, TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and inflammatory cytokine production, all of which may be potential therapeutic targets."
