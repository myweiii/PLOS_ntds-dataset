Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a disease found in children living in low- and middle-income countries, involving gut inflammation similar to that seen in Crohn’s disease or celiac disease. The inflammation leads to poor absorption of nutrients that these children would normally get in their diets, and this malabsorption in turn leads to poor growth, problems with cognitive development, and reduced efficacy of orally-administered vaccines. However, very little is known about what biochemical pathways lead to the inflammation characteristic of EE. One possible pathway involves proteins called TGF-β, p-SMAD2,3, and SMAD7. Normally, TGF-β stops inflammation with help from p-SMAD2,3; on the other hand, SMAD7 blocks this process, causing increased inflammation. Previous research on Crohn’s disease has shown that drugs like Mongersen, which reduces the expression of SMAD7, can help treat the inflammation. We therefore aimed to see if SMAD7 played a similar role in EE. We found that SMAD7 levels were elevated in EE just like in Crohn’s disease, but we found that p-SMAD2,3 levels were also higher in EE than healthy patients, which was surprising given its anti-inflammatory effects. In order to find a treatment for EE, more work is needed to determine the exact role of these SMAD proteins in EE.
