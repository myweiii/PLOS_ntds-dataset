The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, originating from Asia, in the last decade has spread in many regions in Europe and US. Beside the nuisance problem causing to the citizens during the day, this species has raised public health concern, due to its strict association with humans and anthropic habitats, its expanding distribution and its capacities to transmit several human arboviruses. We developed a spatio-temporal model of Ae. albopictus dynamics that helps to understand the biology and the ecology of the species in relation to environmental factors, and to inform efficient control strategies. Here we developed a dynamical species distribution modeling approach at high spatial (over the Balkans) and temporal resolution (weekly scale), enabling to link oviposition activities and climatic conditions across different time periods to forecast the potential future oviposition activities of Ae. albopictus in unknown locations or identify target areas and periods of highest activities. Extrapolating Ae. albopictus abundance over the Balkan region may help to identify habitat suitability where the species has never been reported so far. The temperature-related predictors remain the most determinant predictors among all candidate predictors e.g land cover and rainfall. The model provides useful information for promoting active surveillance on Ae. albopictus and assessing the risk of exotic arbovirus transmission in temperate regions.
