Tapeworm (cestode) infections occur worldwide even in developed countries. Causative species of cestode infections differ significantly depending on the geographical areas and globalization has further complicated the epidemiology of such infections. Nonetheless, recent epidemiological data on cestode infections are limited. Our objectives were to elucidate the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of diphyllobothriosis and taeniosis in Tokyo, Japan. This study revealed that the cestode infection, especially with D. nihonkaiense, has frequently occurred, even in Japanese cities, thereby implicating the probable increase in the prevalence of diphyllobothriosis among travelers, as the number of travelers is expected to increase owing to the Tokyo Olympics/Paralympics in 2020. In addition, compared to diphyllobothriosis, taeniosis was occurred mainly among travelers to and from developing countries even for short period of stay (median 1 month [IQR:1â€“8]). Medical practitioners should be aware of the importance of providing advice to travelers to endemic countries of taeniosis, including the potential risks of infection and preventive methods for these infections.
