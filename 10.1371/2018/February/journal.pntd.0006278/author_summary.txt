Plasmodium falciparum malaria is the principal cause of illness and death in Mozambique. However, the same mosquitoes that transmit P. falciparum parasites also transmit three other species of malaria (P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax) and the worm that causes lymphatic filariasis. To date, we do not know how much transmission of the three other species of malaria occurs. We also do not know if control interventions such as the distribution of bed nets reduce the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and non-falciparum malaria. To address this question, we sampled community members immediately following and one year after a bed net distribution campaign in Mozambique. We analyzed their blood for the presence of antibodies to four species of malaria and lymphatic filariasis. We found that a substantial proportion of individuals had antibodies to P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and the worms causing lymphatic filariasis. We found much lower rates of seropositivity to P. vivax. Individuals reporting using bed nets had a lower risk of testing positive for P. falciparum and P. malariae antibodies. The proportion of the population with access to and using bed nets was too low to cause a population-wide decrease in malaria transmission. There was a significant decline in lymphatic filariasis seropositivity between the two surveys, but we could not attribute it to the bed net distribution campaign. Measuring antibody levels for multiple diseases simultaneously has utility in assessing intervention impact.
