Cestode parasites are flatworms with the ability to parasitize almost every vertebrate species. Several of these parasites are etiological agents of neglected diseases prioritized by WHO, such as hydatid disease, or hydatidosis, a zoonosis caused by species of the genus Echinococcus that affects millions of people worldwide. Due to the scarcity of anthelmintic drugs available and the emergence of resistant parasites, the discovery of new anthelmintic drugs is mandatory. Neuromuscular function has been the target of commonly used drugs against parasitic diseases to impact movement, parasite development and reproduction. Here we describe three new proteins, some of them highly expressed in cestodes which could be relevant for motility. Using different approaches, the three proteins were identified as G protein coupled receptors for serotonin, an important neurotransmitter and a known modulator of cestode motility. These new receptors exhibit unique characteristics including a particular sensitivity to serotonin as well as a distinctive pharmacology, which will assist their targeting for chemotherapeutic intervention.
