It is recognized that the clinical evaluation of patients remains the basis for the characterization of diseases, data interpretation, and patient care. However, incorporation of technological methods into clinical practice has challenged the way cardiologists’ value of history and clinical examination. The present study sought to analyze the importance of clinical findings in a contemporaneous cohort of patients admitted with decompensated heart failure. Our results indicate that the physical exam may identify patients at higher risk in a contemporaneous patient population, and that clinical presentation varies according to etiology—especially Chagas disease—and ventricular function. Our findings support the need of development of specific therapeutic approaches targeted at Chagas patients in the setting of acute decompensated heart failure, as they represent a more vulnerable population.
