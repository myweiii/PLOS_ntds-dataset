Entamoeba nuttalli is the phylogenetically closest protozoan to Entamoeba histolytica and is highly prevalent in macaques. Previous studies have indicated that E. nuttalli is virulent in a hamster model. In this study, we compared the immunopathological basis of formation of liver abscess in hamsters between E. nuttalli and E. histolytica. Mild liver tissue damage developed after intrahepatic injection of trophozoites of E. nuttalli, and lower expression levels of genes for host proinflammatory factors and amebic virulence proteins were detected at the edges of liver abscesses induced by E. nuttalli. In addition, alternatively activated macrophages were increased in E. nuttalli-induced liver abscesses in the late stage of disease progression. The lysate of E. nuttalli trophozoites also induced higher arginase expression than E. histolytica in vitro. Polarization of macrophages is likely to affect the degree of acute inflammatory reactions in liver in an animal model during E. nuttalli infection. Our data reveal new characteristics of abscess formation by E. nuttalli.
