A disease is called vector-borne when it is not transmitted directly among humans, but in a human-vector-human way. Examples of major importance, due to its epidemiological magnitude, are Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika tropical diseases, for which the main vector is the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Usually, some indexes are used to measure the potential damage that such a disease could cause, which concern infectivity and entomological issues, human mobility and geographical density, etc.
We consider a mathematical epidemiological model which takes specifically into account these spatial factors (mobility, density), and propose a set of new risk indexes which give information about how the epidemic spread could occur, and where the outbreaks could take place. These indexes come from a preventive perspective, and they also pay attention to the epidemic dynamics. Consequently, they potentially allow to proceed in the correct places, and before troubles have arisen. We think these new tools could eventually help health agencies in the design of efficient and effective strategies on prevention and control of vector-borne diseases epidemics.
