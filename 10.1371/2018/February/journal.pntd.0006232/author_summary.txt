Human infection with the flatworm Schistosoma mansoni continues to be a public health problem in many tropical countries, including Brazil. The parasitological method recommended by the World Health Organization for the detection of intestinal schistosomiasis, the Kato-Katz method (KK), underestimates the prevalence of the infection in endemic areas with reduced parasite burden. When extensive and supplementary parasitological exams were performed, the prevalence of schistosomiasis in the examined population increased 2.3 times. Additional KK slides and other parasitological methods, such as saline gradient and Helmintex, allowed us to establish a strong reference standard that was used to assess the parasitological tests and the rapid urine test for the detection of the circulating cathodic antigen of S. mansoni (POC-CCA). All tests readily detected the presence of the flatworm in individuals with medium to high parasite loads. The Helmintex method showed the best performance as it detected almost 84% of all infected individuals. A variant of the standard KK method, involving six fecal smears from three stool samples, detected two-thirds of all infections, thus having a performance comparable to that found with the POC-CCA. A combination of this variant KK method with the POC-CCA may be a field-applicable alternative to improve the diagnosis of S. mansoni infections in individuals with low parasite loads in endemic areas.
