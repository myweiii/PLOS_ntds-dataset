Worldwide, approximately 240 million individuals are infected with schistosomiasis, a parasitic neglected tropical disease that continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in China. Effective tools that can accurately predict the prognosis of patients with advanced schistosomiasis would aid in the treatment and management of the disease. To this end, we constructed and compared the performance of three predictive models—an artificial neural network (ANN) model, a logistic regression (LR) model and a decision tree (DT) model—in their ability to predict the prognosis of patients with advanced schistosomiasis. We found that while all three models proved effective, the ANN model outperformed the LR and DT models in terms of AUC and sensitivity. Yet, to achieve the highest level of prediction accuracy and to better assist medical professionals, we recommend comparing the performance of the three predictive models to select the optimal one, which will be better than select a model at random. The findings of this study not only provide valuable information on the construction of effective predictive models for the prognosis of advanced schistosomiasis, but also offer new methodology for clinically determining patient diagnosis and prognosis.
