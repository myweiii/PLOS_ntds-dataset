Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis are infections produced by environmental fungi. Despite the fact that these pathogens are not found in Spain, these diseases are an important health problem in many countries of the world, especially in Latin America. Due to the increased migration from these countries in Spain in the last years, we have observed a rise in the number of new reported cases of these diseases. Nevertheless, they probably remain underestimated since it is likely that physicians do not initially suspect them, and their notification is not mandatory. People who travel to endemic countries are at risk to become infected as well. In this article we used data from the Spanish hospitals records with the aim to describe the main clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these endemic mycoses in Spain, and try to find a correlation between the growing Spanish population at risk and the number of cases hospitalized. This study contributes to have a more accurate knowledge about the burden of these diseases in Spain.
