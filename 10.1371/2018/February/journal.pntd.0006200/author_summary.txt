Campylobacter is a major public health concern in developed and developing countries. C. coli and C. jejuni have long been considered to be the major disease-causing species, and clinical microbiologic approaches target these two species. However, less selective diagnostic approaches have shown the increasing importance of other Campylobacter species (i.e. non-C. coli/jejuni). Our case-control study investigated the association between diarrhea, C. coli/jejuni, and other Campylobacter among 439 stool samples from 201 children in peri-urban communities in Loreto, Peru. Three quarters of the 216 Campylobacter detections were associated with other Campylobacter, whose prevalence increased with age and was greater than that of C. coli/jejuni in all age and clinical groups (dysentery, severe diarrhea, and asymptomatic). Despite their lower prevalence, C. coli/jejuni were more strongly associated with higher levels of myeloperoxidase, clinical dysentery, and the presence of leukocytes and blood in the stool compared to other Campylobacter. Other Campylobacter were equally likely as C. coli/jejuni to be detected in severe diarrhea cases–odds ratio of 1.9 (p-value = 0.018, 95% CI 1.1–3.1) and 2.8 (0.034, 1.1–7.1), respectively. Removing C. coli/jejuni in this population would eliminate 15.1% of diarrhea compared to 24.9% if other Campylobacter were eliminated.
