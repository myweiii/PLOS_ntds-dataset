Ethiopia has the world's highest burden of trachoma. The disease causes significant blindness and visual impairment, particularly in poorer communities. To prevent the transmission of active trachoma, mass administration of Zithromax is given every year, which is implemented for consecutive three to five years in endemic and hyper endemic areas of the country. We have shown that the mass administration coverage of Zithromax, in 2016, was greater than 90% in the South and Southeastern zones of Tigray, Ethiopia. However, it was accompanied by a number of program challenges and social barriers.Women development armies and health extension workers were key players in community mobilization and drug provision, respectively.
