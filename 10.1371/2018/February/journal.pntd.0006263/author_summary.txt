Dengue fever, an Aedes mosquito-borne viral infection, is a self-limiting or asymptomatic viral infection. In its severe form, severe dengue, the symptoms include organ failure, life-threatening bleeding, and shock. Patients with obesity were found to be at higher risks of developing complications and severe dengue infection compared to non-obese patients. Our systematic review and meta-analysis critically compared the available shreds of evidence related to obesity and severe forms of dengue infection. A total of fifteen studies that include nine cohort studies, five case-control studies, and one cross-sectional study were reviewed to explore the association between obesity and dengue severity. The results indicated that obese patients have higher odds of developing severe dengue infection compared to non-obese patients. This review highlighted the importance of obesity in the progression of dengue infection. With increasing prevalence of obese individual as well as expanding areas that were at high risk for dengue infection, obesity may play a role in increasing the burden and mortality related to dengue infection. Further large-scale prospective studies in regions with high prevalence of dengue infections would provide additional information and some better discernment on the relevance of obesity in dengue infection.
