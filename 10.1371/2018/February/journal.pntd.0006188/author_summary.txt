African trypanosomiasis is a parasitic disease which affects humans and other animals in 36 sub-Saharan African countries. The disease is transmitted by the tsetse fly, and the human form of the diseases is known as sleeping sickness. In an attempt to improve our understanding of the mechanisms which contribute to sleeping sickness transmission, a detailed, seasonally driven model of the tsetse fly has been produced, with the theory that a greater understanding of the disease vectorâ€™s life cycle will allow developments in our knowledge of disease transmission. The model incorporates previously developed spatial data for the Luangwa Valley case study, along with demographic data for its inhabitants. Tsetse and potential human and animal hosts are modelled at the individual level, allowing each contact and infection to be recorded through time. Through modelling at a fine-scale, we can incorporate detailed mechanisms for tsetse birth, feeding, reproduction and death, while considering what demographics, and which locations, have a heightened risk of disease.
