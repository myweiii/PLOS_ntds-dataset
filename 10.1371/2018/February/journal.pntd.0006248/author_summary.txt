Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a cause of severe hemorragic disease in humans, is maintained in nature in a tick-vertebrate-tick enzootic cycle characterized by silent persistence of endemic foci with intermittent epidemics. Most studies support ticks of the genus Hyalomma as the main CCHFV vectors, but some laboratory reports and field studies also allude to other tick species that may be responsible for virus circulation. Here we converted the tick-host interactions of 133 species of ticks with reported geographical distribution over the range of CCHFV into a network of relationships. By a series of network analyses, we found that immatures of the genus Hyalomma are unique in their hosts preferences among the examined tick genera. Immatures of the genus Hyalomma concentrate on rodent and rabbit hosts, which most efficiently support CCHFV maintenance and transmission by ticks in nature. Based on these data, we formulate the hypothesis that the ecological relationships between Hyalomma spp. and their hosts form a delicate equilibrum that differentiates human epidemics from periods of silent CCHFV maintenance.
