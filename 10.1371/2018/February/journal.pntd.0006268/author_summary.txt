The global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically over the last few decades and has become the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne disease. To date, there is no specific treatment. A vaccine came on the market in 2015, but it will be several years before it becomes widely available and its efficacy is limited. Therefore vector control is the most important means of dengue prevention at the current time. The World Health Organization recommends the adoption of an integrated vector management approach using community-based methods tailored to the local context. In order to design appropriate strategies, it is essential to understand local knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding dengue vector control. We conducted a survey in the Cambodian province of Kampong Cham, to investigate the local knowledge levels as well as self-reported vector control practices and observed practices. We found a high knowledge of dengue transmission, and Aedes breeding and biting prevention methods. However, no correlation was found between self-reported vector control practices and observed practices. Additionally, knowledge levels did not correlate with actual vector control practices.
