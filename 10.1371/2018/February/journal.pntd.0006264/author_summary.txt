Tissue aspiration, either from spleen, bone marrow or lymph node, remains the Gold Standard for parasitological confirmation in patients suspected of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and is often used for detection of relapses, and as a test of cure. The procedure is invasive, with risks of severe complications, requires skilled personnel to perform, and appropriate facilities to manage severe adverse events, if they occur. These drawbacks can be solved by using sensitive diagnostic test based on peripheral blood. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are sensitive for the detection of Leishmania parasites in blood; however, in VL-endemic settings, most NAAT are restricted to well-equipped laboratories. A robust NAAT, Loopamp Leishmania Detection Kit has recently been developed in a collaboration between FIND, Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan and other partners. We have evaluated this kit in Sudan and obtained a sensitivity of 97.6% and specificity of 99.1%, using DNA obtained from peripheral blood through a simple boil and spin method. Its simplicity and excellent diagnostic performance make this kit ideal for parasitological confirmation of VL in less equipped laboratories.
