Mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) typically causes a mild and self-limiting illness known as Zika fever. During the recent outbreak in South America, ZIKV infection during pregnancy was associated with severe congenital abnormalities. We developed a vaccine against ZIKV utilizing virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs are structurally similar to viruses, but are not infectious. We injected mutant mice capable of succumbing to ZIKV infection with these VLPs. Mice vaccinated with VLPs survived infection, while negative control mice died. These studies are important because ZIKVLP based vaccines could be tested in humans as a prophylactic candidate with minimal safety concerns able to protect unborn babies whose mothers become infected with Zika virus during pregnancy.
