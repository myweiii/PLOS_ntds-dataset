Understanding the geographic distribution of dengue transmission intensity is of key importance for guiding dengue prevention strategies, including vaccination. We analyzed age-stratified data from a cross-sectional survey of 30 randomly selected urban sub-districts in Indonesia and estimated the force of infection (FOI) in each. Substantial variation in FOI estimates were observed, ranging from 4% to 30% between sub-districts. Heterogeneity which will be important to understand when considering future vaccine introduction in Indonesia. Higher odds of dengue seropositivity were associated with increasing levels of urbanization, which may represent areas where more people could benefit from dengue vaccination or should otherwise be prioritized for dengue control.
