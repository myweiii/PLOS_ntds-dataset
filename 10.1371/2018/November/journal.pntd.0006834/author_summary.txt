As part of our efforts to identify compounds that are active against the parasite that causes malaria (P. falciparum), we employed a “parasite hopping” approach in our drug discovery efforts. This involved screening a library of demonstrated antiparasitic agents against other parasites responsible for a host of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including Chagas disease (T. cruzi), human African trypanosomiasis (T. brucei) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (L. major). The compounds we identified generally show improved selectivity for the parasite of interest over the mammalian cell lines tested and, from this work, we have made progress towards the identification of lead compounds against multiple NTDs.
