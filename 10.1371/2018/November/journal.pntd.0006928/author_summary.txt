Giardia duodenalis is a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide and a wide range of mammalian hosts. G. duodenalis presents considerable genetic variability and there is an increasing demand for the development of new molecular markers. This study aimed to identify and characterize genomic microsatellites of Giardia based on the different available genomes. After performing an analysis using MISA and SciRoKo software, 1,853 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified and many of them were annotated as variant-specific surface proteins. We detected 20 polymorphic SSRs, including one shared among all available genomes. Because the markers are based on a simple PCR, they have a great potential for use in future studies of Giardia through PCR, genetic sequencing or genotyping by real-time PCR.
