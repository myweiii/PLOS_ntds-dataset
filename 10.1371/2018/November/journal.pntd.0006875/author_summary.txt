Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a tropical neglected illness that affects 6 million people worldwide, mostly in Latin America. Our research group focuses on the elucidation of DNA repair and metabolism of T. cruzi, and on the possible implications of those mechanisms in both parasite genetic diversity and Chagas disease development. In this work, we investigated the involvement of homologous recombination in the oxidation-induced damage response, and in DNA repair, in T. cruzi cells after gamma radiation exposure. We also examined whether TcRad51 –a key protein for homologous recombination–could be an important factor for T. cruzi’s infectivity. We generated genetically-modified T. cruzi cells for RAD51 and studied the in vitro and in vivo infectivity of these mutant cells. Our results indicate that TcRad51 is a key protein involved in the repair of oxidative and DNA double-strand breaks lesions in two crucial developmental forms of T. cruzi.
