Schistosomiasis control is currently based on large-scale, preventive chemotherapy treatment with praziquantel (PZQ), and this has resulted in a significant reduction in its prevalence and associated morbidity worldwide. Recommended PZQ dosing is 40â€“60 mg/Kg body weight, but to facilitate large-scale drug administration programs, a dose pole to estimate PZQ doses based on height has been developed by WHO, as height has been shown to accurately correlate with body weight among children in endemic areas. WHO estimates that 206 million people, including 91 million adults, will need to be treated annually across 52 countries by 2020. Published literature indicates that the dose pole has a satisfactory accuracy for children, however it seems to deliver an insufficient dose (<30mg/Kg body weight) to approximately 20% of adults and overweight children. This paper evaluated the accuracy of the PZQ dose pole for the large-scale treatment of urogenital schistosomiasis in Mozambique and discusses the necessity for an update of the current WHO-dose pole based on modifications recommended in recent literature. Preventing underdosing among adults and overweight children should improve treatment outcomes and minimize the potential emergence of PZQ-resistant strains.
