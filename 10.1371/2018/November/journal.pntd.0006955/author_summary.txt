Human rabies deaths are preventable with timely provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis: wound treatment, rabies immunoglobulin, and vaccinations. In countries where resources are available, variability in healthcare seeking behaviors and lack of adherence to recommended treatment guidelines may also contribute rabies deaths. In our study, we examined animal-bite reporting to the national surveillance system, and patientâ€™s adherence to treatment guidelines at nine healthcare facilities in Haiti, a high rabies burden country. Our study found 2.5 times more patients than reported by the national surveillance system. This underreporting can unintentionally impact rabies awareness and the allocation of resources to animal-bite victims. Furthermore, our study found that among patients who received care, a majority of them are seeking care in a timely manner, suggesting that reducing rabies deaths is an achievable goal in Haiti.
