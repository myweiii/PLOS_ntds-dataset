Ethiopia bears a high burden of visceral leishmaniasis (VL)â€”a neglected tropical disease transmitted through the bite of a sand fly that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Without treatment, VL progresses, causing increasingly severe symptoms and ultimately death within two years, in most cases. Early access to VL diagnosis and care improves clinical prognosis and reduces transmission from infected humans; however, significant obstacles exist. To our knowledge, our study is the first in Ethiopia to use qualitative methods to assess barriers to VL diagnosis and care among seasonal mobile workers. Strikingly, we found that contrary to what health policy for VL dictates in this endemic setting, study participants reported very poor access to diagnosis and, consequently, significantly delayed access to treatment. Our findings have important public health and policy implications. Specifically, our results offer strategies that may increase access to VL diagnosis and care, allowing for earlier treatment and better prognoses for VL patients, and reducing the potential health disparities and the overall burden of VL.
