The World Health Organizationâ€™s 2020 Goals for Chagas disease include access to antiparasitic treatment and care of all infected/ill patients. Policy makers need to know the economic value of identifying and treating patients earlier and what can be invested. We evaluated the impact and economic outcomes (costs, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit) of identifying and treating different percentages of Chagas patients in the acute and indeterminate disease states using a transmission model linked to a clinical and economic outcomes model. Identifying and treating Chagas cases in the acute and indeterminate stages could result in up to an 18.0% relative reduction in transmission events as well as a 68.2% relative reduction in new chronic cases over 50 years compared to no treatment and was always economically dominant compared to no treatment. Identifying and treating Chagas disease in its earlier stages would reduce transmission and result in better health outcomes and cost-savings. In fact, the cost-savings would outweigh the cost of treating, meaning that earlier treatment may pay for itself. This supports the need for improved diagnostics and access to effective treatment.
