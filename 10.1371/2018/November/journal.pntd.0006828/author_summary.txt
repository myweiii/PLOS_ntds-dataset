Aedes albopictus represents a serious threat to public health as a vector for a number of arboviruses, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Its ability to resist insecticides has recently been detected in several countries. However, little is known regarding molecular mechanisms that confer pyrethroid resistance. Determining such mechanisms is essential for early detection, monitoring, and management of insecticide resistance. Here, we use high-throughput RNA sequencing techniques, RNAi, and genotype-phenotype association study to characterize qualitative and quantitative differences in gene expression as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms between resistant and susceptible Ae. albopictus individuals collected from a dengue-endemic area in southern China. We identified 3 candidate genes and 5 candidate SNPs associated with deltamethrin resistance. These results enhance the understanding of insecticide resistance mechanisms among Aedes albopictus.
