Enteric pathogens such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses can cause diarrhea and other longer-term health problems. Poor sanitary conditions, including inadequate sanitation facilities, can lead to contamination of the living environment and higher risk of exposure to and transmission of enteric pathogens. Young children, who are vulnerable to both the short- and long-term health effects of enteric infections, interact with their environment in different ways than older children or adults. In order to limit enteric pathogen transmission among this vulnerable group, we must understand the infection burden and the environmental or sanitation-related factors that are associated with infection. Among a group of children younger than four years old living in low-income neighborhoods of Maputo, Mozambique, we found over 85% tested had â‰¥1 enteric infection. Children living in environments visibly contaminated with feces were more likely to have an infection than children whose living environments were not visibly contaminated. In contrast, children living in compounds with certain latrine features, including walls and pit covers (potential indicators of build quality), had reduced infection risk. Understanding that these risk factors may play important roles in exposure and transmission in this setting is key to planning effective interventions.
