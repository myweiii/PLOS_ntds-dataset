    "Background": "In a previous study, we found that Trichinella spiralis muscle larva excretory and secretory proteins (ES-P) most likely activate collagen synthesis via TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling, and this event could influence collagen capsule formation.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "In order to identify the specific collagen inducing factor, ES-P was fractionated by a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column. We obtained three large fractions, F1, F2, and F3, but only F3 had collagen gene inducing ability. After immunoscreening, 10 collagen inducing factor candidates were identified. Among them, TS 15\u20131 and TS 15\u20132 were identical to the putative trypsin of T. spiralis. The deduced TS 15\u20131 (M.W. = 72 kDa) had two conserved catalytic motifs, an N-terminal Tryp_SPc domain (TS 15-1n) and a C-terminal Tryp_SPc domain (TS 15-1c). To determine their collagen inducing ability, recombinant proteins (rTS 15-1n and rTS 15-1c) were produced using the pET-28a expression system. TS 15\u20131 is highly expressed during the muscle larval stage and has strong antigenicity. We determined that rTS 15-1c could elevate collagen I via activation of the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo.",
    "Conclusion/Significance": "In conclusion, we identified a host collagen inducing factor from T. spiralis ES-P using immunoscreening and demonstrated its molecular characteristics and functions."
