Molecular xenomonitoring has demonstrated significant potential as a non-invasive means of providing reliable surveillance for the presence of lymphatic filariasis (LF)-causing parasites. Given the continuing successes of global mass drug administration efforts, the need for such non-invasive surveillance techniques is expanding. However, considering the significant infrastructural demands which such surveillance requires, the development of simplified surveillance methodologies will be fundamental to future programmatic implementation efforts. Accordingly, we have developed a novel, simplified diagnostic platform for point-of-collection-based detection of the LF-causing parasite, Brugia malayi in pools of mosquitoes. By coupling a rapid and inexpensive DNA extraction methodology with a field-friendly amplification platform and test strip-based detection assay, this backpack PCR system eliminates the need for expensive instrumentation and laboratory-based infrastructure. Furthermore, adaptation of the platform described here will allow for the straightforward and rapid development of a parallel assay for the detection of Wuchereria bancrofti, facilitating the increased use of xenomonitoring and enabling mosquito surveillance efforts in regions lacking sophisticated laboratory infrastructure.
