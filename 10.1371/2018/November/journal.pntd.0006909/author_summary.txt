In the era of malaria elimination, novel surveillance strategies are needed in order to achieve and sustain malaria free status in the region. New malaria infection burden surveillance strategies should be simple to implement, technologically uncomplicated, cost-effective and applicable to areas where malaria cases are known to occur. In this context, the xenosurveillance is an important tool, especially when using widely distributed and anthropophilic mosquitoes. Culex mosquitoes do not transmit malaria, but due to their wide dispersion and anthropophilic behavior, may be used for the monitoring of certain vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, whose agent can be easily identified through molecular techniques in the ingested blood. Here, we evaluated a Plasmodium xenosurveillance approach to determine human malaria prevalence in three distinct peri-urban areas of Manaus. For this purpose, we evaluated the presence of Plasmodium DNA in engorged culicids sampled indoors regardless of their role in malaria transmission and compared them with the human infection status in the same households. The spatial correlation between the presence of Plasmodium DNA in mosquitoes was similar to the infection rate in humans which clearly indicates that xenosurveillance can be a complimentary strategy in endemic tropical regions in order to estimate the malaria burden.
