Strongyloidiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by a parasite which is endemic in most parts of the world. It can cause a life-threatening disease among immunosuppressed individuals and can be transmitted from solid organ transplant donors to recipients. We retrospectively investigated the prevalence of strongyloidiasis among deceased individuals from endemic areas who were considered for solid organ transplant donation in our center, by performing a serological assay using our institutionâ€™s serum bank. We found a high prevalence of strongyloidiasis among these deceased candidates to donation, but only one of the six who tested positive was finally a donor, without transmitting the disease to recipients. Our results should encourage physicians to adhere to current guidelines which recommend active screening of strongyloidiasis in potential solid organ transplant donors from endemic areas who may be infected. There is a clear need for a rapid diagnostic test to fully implement systematic screening among these individuals.
