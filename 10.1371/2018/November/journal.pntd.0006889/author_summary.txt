Identifying the causative agent in an acute febrile illness can be challenging diagnostically, especially when organisms in a particular region have overlapping clinical presentation or when that pathogenâ€™s presence is unexpected. Ebola virus, for example, was not considered in an acute febrile illness differential diagnosis in West Africa until the explosive outbreak in 2013 presented the risk of infection. Besides the cost and time of screening a single patient sample for a large number of pathogens, limited sample volumes place further restrictions on what assays can be applied. Here, we developed a broad pathogen screening assay targeting 164 different human pathogens and show positive detection of over 100 of the organisms on the panel including Ebola virus, Plasmodium falciparum, and a large number of rare pathogens. The hands on time and sample volume requirement is minimal. The assay performed well in mock clinical and human clinical samples, demonstrating the clinical utility of this assay in cases where the initial diagnostic testing results in negative results. Our results provide a framework for further validation studies that would be required for formal clinical diagnostic applications.
