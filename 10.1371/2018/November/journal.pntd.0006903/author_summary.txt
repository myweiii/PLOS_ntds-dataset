ZIKV has emerged as a vector-borne pathogen capable of causing serious illness in infected adults and congenital birth defects. The vulnerability of communities to future ZIKV outbreaks will depend, in part, on the prevalence and longevity of protective immunity, thought to be mediated principally by antibodies. We currently lack diagnostic assays able to differentiate ZIKV-specific antibodies from antibodies produced following infection with closely related DENV, and we do not know how long anti-ZIKV responses are detectable. Here we profile antibodies recognizing linear epitopes throughout the entire ZIKV polyprotein, and we profile cross-reactivity with the proteomes of other co-endemic arboviruses. We show that while ZIKV-specific antibody binding can be detected, these responses are generally weak and ephemeral, and false positives may arise through DENV infection. This may complicate efforts to discern ZIKV infection and to determine ZIKV seroprevalence using linear epitope-based assays. The method used in this study, however, has promise as a tool for profiling antibody responses for a broad array of neglected tropical diseases and other pathogens and in distinguishing serology of closely-related viruses.
