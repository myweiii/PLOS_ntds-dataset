Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are one of the most important mechanism of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. These CYP enzymes break down insecticides into non-toxic forms that can be readily excreted. An increase of CYP-mediated detoxification is commonly found in pyrethroid resistant Aedes aegypti, however the link between specific CYPs and the resistance loci have not been clearly established for this species. In this study, we measured the expression levels of nine candidate CYPs in two strains highly resistant to permethrin: SP, a field collected strain that was selected with permethrin for high levels of resistance and CKR, a strain that contains the resistance mechanisms from SP, but that is congenic (i.e. has the genetic background) to the insecticide susceptible strain, ROCK. We found seven overexpressed CYPs in SP and four in CKR, confirming their involvement in resistance. Next, we sequenced the CYP genes (with the exception of the duplicated ones) to determine if the genes themselves are located in the resistance locus (meaning their expression is cis-regulated) or not (meaning their expression is trans-regulated). We found no reduced polymorphisms in any of the resistant strain (SP) CYPs, suggesting that the overexpression of these CYPs (and thus CYP-mediated resistance) is trans-regulated.
