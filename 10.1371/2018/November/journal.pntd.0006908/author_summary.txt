In this study, the general characteristics of human anthrax outbreaks that occurred in northwestern China over the past decade were described. Meanwhile, the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis isolated from these areas from 1990 to 2016 were analyzed with the canSNP and MLVA15 methods. Our results showed a diversity of MLVA genotypes. We also observed gradual balancing of the geographical distribution of B. anthracis population in northwestern China according to the canSNP analysis. In particular, the A.Br.Ames subgroup now seems to be scattered from Inner Mongolia to other provinces, in contrast to the data before 1990. This study also provides preliminary survey results on the population diversity of B. anthracis in China, which will help to promote the prevention and control of this important disease.
