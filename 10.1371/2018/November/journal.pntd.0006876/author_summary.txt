During the years 2013–2016, worldwide Zika epidemics spread quickly throughout immune-naïve human populations. In 2015–2016, the Dominican Republic was struck by an epidemic of dengue followed by an outbreak of Zika. The Zika epidemic closely followed the tail of the dengue epidemic and provided an opportunity to study the dynamics of Zika and dengue transmission at the population level over a similar timeframe. The findings showed that while dengue cases were marginally higher among males, Zika cases were much higher among females and in particular among sexually active age groups. This might indicate that 1) prior dengue infections (and hence antibody cross-reactivity) in these populations had no material impact on the likelihood of reporting Zika illness 2) over-reporting in females was due to health campaigning that targeted females or 3) there was a biological cause for increased susceptibility among women. These possible causes are not mutually exclusive but it is most likely that the clustering of cases among women was the result of health-seeking behaviour caused by health campaigns and media coverage of Zika at the time. If so, media campaigns can be an effective strategy for encouraging health-seeking behaviour among target demographics.
