As humans move around the globe they contact new environments, potentially introducing novel diseases to wildlife, domestic animals and humans. Understanding how current infection patterns were established and how humans have likely altered them can help protect human, animal and environmental health. We traced the evolution of and distribution of globally distributed, pathogenic Bartonella, a common and well-studied bacterial genus in wildlife and humans that can cause cat scratch disease, trench fever and other diseases. We showed that humans are likely changing disease risk for themselves and the animals in their environment by moving themselves and domestic animals, as evidenced by large geographic movements of infections or shared infections in distantly related species. Not only does this increase our knowledge about Bartonella, an important emerging pathogen, but our investigation can serve as a model for elucidating the driving role of humans in changing disease landscapes.
