Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a mosquito-borne Alphavirus responsible for outbreaks in South America and the Caribbean. In this study we infected different species of mosquito (belonging to the genera Aedes, Anopheles and Culex) with MAYV and tested their capacity to transmit the virus at different time points. Results show that Anopheles mosquitoes were competent vectors for 2 genotypes of MAYV, while Aedes and Culex were poor vectors. The capacity of Anopheles mosquitoes to transmit MAYV highlights their importance as neglected vectors of arboviruses. These data suggest that Anopheles mosquitoes have the potential to sustain transmission cycles of neglected pathogens in na√Øve regions, including the United States.
