African trypanosomes cause devastating and lethal diseases in humans and livestock. These parasites are transmitted among mammals by tsetse flies and circulate and grow in blood and tissue fluids. There are several drugs available to treat patients but, despite their use for many decades, we know relatively little about how they work. We reasoned that exposure of trypanosomes to each drug, followed by microscopic examination of cellular structures, would reveal the major cellular compartments, structures or growth phases affected. For example, we examined two major DNA structures, and cellular compartments known as mitochondria. We found that two drugs thought to act in mitochondria did indeed disrupt this compartment, but in completely different ways. Another drug stopped cell growth at a specific point in the cycle. An arsenic-based drug, related to anti-leukaemia drugs, perturbed the nuclear DNA division cycle, indicating that arsenicals may kill parasites and cancer cells by similar mechanisms. Thus, the ‘chemical-biology’ profiles we observe illuminate distinct killing mechanisms. A similar approach can now be used to assess new drugs, and the insights may help to develop improved anti-parasite therapies.
