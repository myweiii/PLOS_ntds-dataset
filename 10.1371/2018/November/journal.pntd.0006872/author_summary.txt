Histoplasmosis is an endemic mycosis in many regions of Latin America. In the HIV population it manifests as progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH), an entity hard to diagnose since the causative fungi—Histoplasma capsulatum—is slow growing and requires advance biosafety for its handling. As an alternative, the diagnosis can be made by detecting the histoplasma urinary antigen, but only one kit is commercially available outside the US. We evaluated this kit (IMMY ALPHA Histoplasma EIA) among HIV patients with suspected and found a high specificity but low sensitivity (i.e., a positive histoplasma urine antigen is almost unequivocal, but a negative result does not rule out the PDH). However, we believe the test is useful since the positive likelihood rates show that a patient with PDH is 27 times more likely to have an IMMY-HUAg positive result; this may allow early targeted treatment.
