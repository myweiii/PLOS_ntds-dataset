Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-transmitted worm infection that causes chronic and progressive swelling of the limbs (lymphoedema) and testis (hydrocoele). Over time this swelling results in significant disfigurement and disability for sufferers. In 2000, Myanmar commenced a National Program to Eliminate LF through the annual mass drug administration (MDA) of two de-worming medications: albendazole and diethylcarbamazine to all endemic districts. However there remains little reliable information on how well the elimination program is working, and how large the burden of disease is in the country. This study assessed the prevalence of LF and participation in the MDA program in 24 villages across four townships of Mandalay Region in central Myanmar. The study found ongoing filarial infection suggesting that the six rounds of MDA had not been sufficient to stop LF transmission in the area. It also identified a substantial burden of hydrocoele but no cases of lymphoedema. These results suggest that further rounds of effective MDA are required to halt LF transmission and highlight the urgent need for morbidity management programs in the country.
