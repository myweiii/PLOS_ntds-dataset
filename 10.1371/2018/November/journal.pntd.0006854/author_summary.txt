Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania (L.) parasites. In the Old World and the Near East, CL is mainly caused by L. major and L. tropica. The ongoing Syrian war and the resulting massive population displacement led to an alarming increase in the incidence of CL, in Syria and its surrounding countries. Current therapies against CL lead to partial or complete cure in L. major infections but are less effective against L. tropica. These therapies associate with several limitations, including patientsâ€™age, immune system, repetitive painful injections, high cost, poor availability, and mainly systemic toxicity. Therefore, it is of high interest to seek for novel drugs against CL. We assessed the activity of an immunomodulatory drug and its analog against L. major and L. tropica parasites and showed their potency. Importantly, the analog proved more efficient against the wild type L. tropica strain. These results highlight the promising efficacy of immuno-modulatory drugs against CL.
