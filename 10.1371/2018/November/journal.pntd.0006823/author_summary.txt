Present study was carried out to find out the association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism, mRNA gene expression of VDR gene and level of vitamin D with leprosy reactions and leprosy patients. Surprisingly, level of vitamin D in leprosy patients was not found to be associated with the disease and its manifestations. VDR genotypes (Fok1 and Taq1) were found to be associated with leprosy patients. t-F-a haplotype was significantly associated with leprosy patients. Gene expression of vitamin D receptor was lower in leprosy patients in comparison to healthy controls.
