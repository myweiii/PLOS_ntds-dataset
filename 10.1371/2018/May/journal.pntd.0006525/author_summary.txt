Since 2008 L6 is the endemic lineage that has circulated in SJRP. In 2010, the L1 lineage was first identified in the city. For a period, both lineages co-circulated, and then in 2013, L1 began to diminish until it was no longer detected in the population. Differences in replicative fitness are usually the main factor for clade replacement (CR) in DENV epidemics. However, despite the better viral fitness of the emerging lineage, the absence of CR could not be explained by these differences alone. Here, we combine epidemiological, phylogenetic, molecular and immunological analyses to provide a more precise understanding of the role of fitness in lineage dynamics with the persistence of L6 even after the introduction of L1 without CR. Differences in immune responses elicited by DENV-1 L1 and L6 lineages (genotype V), but not viral fitness in mosquito or human cells, explain the dynamics of circulating DENV in a city of Brazil.
