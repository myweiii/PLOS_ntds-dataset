Scabies and impetigo are common and important skin conditions which are often neglected in developing countries. Scabies affects more than 200 million people globally. There are limited data on the prevalence of these conditions in Timor-Leste. Scabies is a parasitic infection which causes an intensely itchy rash in a characteristic distribution. Secondary bacterial infection with group A Streptococcus (GAS) and/or Staphylococcus aureus causing impetigo is common and may lead to complications. GAS skin infection is known to be associated with the development of acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and may also have a role in the aetiology of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD. We assessed almost 1400 school students in Timor-Leste from both urban and rural settings and showed a high prevalence of scabies (22.4%) and active impetigo (9.7%). Two-thirds of students had evidence of either active or healed impetigo. Our study shows that scabies and impetigo are common in Timor-Leste, with very high prevalence of scabies in the rural district of Ermera. Improvements in prevention and treatment are needed, with prioritised activities in the rural areas where prevalence is highest.
