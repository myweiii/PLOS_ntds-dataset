Children from low-income settings experience linear growth faltering and neurodevelopmental delay that have been associated with maternal, socioeconomic, and infectious/inflammatory variables. Given the interdependent nature of these associations, understanding which variables are the best predictors of poor outcomes has been difficult. We conducted a longitudinal study of Bangladeshi children from birth to two years and collected predictors assessing maternal, inflammatory, and socioeconomic aspects of early childhood in Bangladeshi children. We conducted a random forests analysis to rank predictors associated with growth and neurodevelopment. Linear growth was best predicted by birth anthropometry and maternal weight. Cognitive function was predicted by birth anthropometry, socioeconomic status, and systemic inflammation. The receipt of the rotavirus vaccine and a combination of systemic inflammatory, maternal, and socioeconomic variables predicted language score. Motor score was predicted by systemic inflammation with enteric inflammatory markers having a reverse relationship. Social-emotional development was predicted by systemic inflammation, birth anthropometry, and economic means. This work demonstrates that specific pathways are responsible for different aspects of growth and development. Our data suggest that studies investigating pediatric stunting in low-income settings should focus on maternal and prenatal variables while those focused on neurodevelopmental outcomes should additionally target causes of systemic and enteric inflammation.
