Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic pathogens and saprophytes found largely in wet soil, marshland, streams, rivers and estuaries. Pulmonary and extrapulmonary Infections caused by NTM’s increased globally in immune-suppressed and immune-competent individuals without an exemption to Saudi Arabia. However, recent developments in diagnostic platforms improved the identification of several new and rare species of NTM’s. Interestingly, recent studies linked the direct impact of species spectrum on clinical outcome and therapies. To date, in Saudi Arabia, no systematic nationwide surveillance study was conducted on the challenges of NTM causing diseases. Therefore, for the first time, a nationwide inventory study on the spectrum of clinically relevant pulmonary and extra pulmonary diseases with an attempt to explore epidemiological data has been carried out. The study results showed a huge species spectrum of NTM’s causing highly diverse clinical manifestations. Clinical relevance pulmonary infection was relatively high and several very rare extrapulmonary infections also were observed. The study reported the emergence of a rare pathogen, Mycobacterium riyadhense and predominance of Mycobacterium simiae as the most common species. As the first large scale study from the GCC region, the findings cements the growing potential of various NTM species to cause significant clinical implications in the country and warrants an immediate change on disease management priorities.
