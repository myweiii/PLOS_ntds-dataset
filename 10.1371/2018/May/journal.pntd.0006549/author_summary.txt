Scabies causes rash and severe itch and predisposes to serious infection and chronic diseases of the heart and kidneys. Despite scabies being an ancient disease found in all parts of the world, we currently lack reliable laboratory tests. Clinicians generally make an assessment based on history and skin examination. Variation in diagnosis causes problems when trying to determine the prevalence of scabies in a region, or when trying to investigate the effectiveness of a treatment or control strategy. We aimed to establish consensus among experts on how to diagnose scabies. Thirty-four international experts responded to anonymous questionnaires on how tests and clinical features of scabies should be used to form a diagnosis. Draft criteria were developed and refined, incorporating three levels of diagnostic certaintyâ€“Confirmed Scabies, Clinical Scabies and Suspected Scabies. After three rounds of surveys, 82% of participants supported the criteria. After four rounds, consensus was reached with very high agreement for all criteria (Confirmed Scabies, 96%; Clinical Scabies, 93%; Suspected Scabies, 100%) and 96% supported adoption of the criteria. It is hoped the 2018 IACS Criteria for the Diagnosis of Scabies will allow harmonization of diagnosis and reporting, and comparison between studies of scabies burden and treatments.
