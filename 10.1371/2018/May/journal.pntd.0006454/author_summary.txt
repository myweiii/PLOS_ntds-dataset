WHOâ€™s Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariais (LF) supports annual mass drug administration to over 400 million people in LF-endemic areas each year. Two drug combinations (either DEC or ivermectin, given with albendazole) have been recommended in most endemic areas. With the exception of well-described serious adverse events (AEs) occurring in patients with high level loiasis, severe AEs due to these medications are extremely rare. Mild to moderate AEs, however, are common, particularly in patients with active filarial infection. In this manuscript we synthesize published data on AEs following single-dose treatment of LF with ivermectin, DEC, or albendazole. This provides a background against which to compare the safety of triple drug therapy (ivermectin, DEC, and albendazole) recently endorsed by WHO, and provides a useful context for evaluating safety of new treatments for LF. The compiled data illustrate that transient, mild to moderate AEs following single-dose LF treatment are common in microfilaremic patients and are much less common in amicrofilaremic patients. They also show that passive surveillance for post-treatment AEs underestimates AE incidence and suggest that adherence to common reporting standards would improve the usefulness of AE reporting in filariasis studies.
