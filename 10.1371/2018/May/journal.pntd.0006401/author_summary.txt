The high number of asylum seekers arriving in Europe between 2014 and 2016 emphasized the importance to expand knowledge on best practice regarding health care provision and control of infectious diseases that may come with migration. Adequate control of scabies is important to prevent severe forms of scabies and prevent spread of the disease. Studies on interventions preventing or treating scabies in asylum seekers are very limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides data on an intervention targeting scabies in asylum seekers. This study shows that a scabies prevention and treatment programme at start of the asylum procedure is feasible and effective in the Netherlands. Patients were diagnosed early and risk of reinfestations and complications reduced. The programme may be used both to improve clinical practice and could serve as model for future policies on similar programmes.
