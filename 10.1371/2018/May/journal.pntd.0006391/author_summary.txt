Mycetoma enjoys all the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) characteristics. It frequently affects the poorest of the poor in poor communities in remote regions. The affected population are of low socio-economic status, of low visibility and low political and social voice and hence they are neglected. The disease is considered as a social stigma in particularly among females and children thus they tend to hide it for prolong period and when they are compelled to seek medical care the condition is then at a late stage. The mycetoma patients have many financial constraints that hinder them from seeking medical and health care. In the remote mycetoma endemic areas, the health and medical facilities are meagre, and it is difficult for the patients to reach the regional health centres and thus the majority of patients present with late advanced disease. To overcome these treatment difficulties, the MRC had adopted this holistic management approach to decentralised the patient's care, improve the disease awareness and advocacy, provide free medical and surgical treatment locally at the village level, and to improve the affected villages environmental and hygienic conditions. In this communication, the MRC is reporting on this unique experience, discussing the advantages and difficulties faced it and suggesting recommendations to improve it to be adopted worldwide. Reviewing the medical literature revealed, no report on such management approached for mycetoma patients and thus it worth reporting it.
