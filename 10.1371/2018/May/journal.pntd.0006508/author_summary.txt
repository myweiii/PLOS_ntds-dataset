Oropouche Virus causes typical arboviral febrile illness and is widely distributed in tropical region of Americas, mainly Amazon region, associated with cases of encephalitis. 500,000 people are estimated to be infected with Oropouche worldwide and some states in Brazil detected higher number of cases among other arboviruses such as Dengue and Chikungunya. As much as climate change, human migration and vector and host availability might increase the risk of virus transmission. Despite its estimated high prevalence in Central and South America populations, the literature concerning the main aspects of viral biology remain scarce and began to be investigated only in the last two decades. Nonetheless, little is known about virus-host cell interactions and pathogenesis. Virus infection regulates cellular pathways either promoting its replication or escaping from immune response through microRNAs. Knowing which microRNAs and target genes are modulated in infection could give us new insights to understand multiple aspects of infection. Here, we depicted candidate miRNAs, genes and pathways affected by Oropouche Virus infection in hepatocyte cells. We hope this work serve as guideline for prospective studies in order to assess the complexity regarding the orthobunyaviruses infections.
