Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss), an intestinal nematode, the causative agent of strongyloidiasis, infects 30–100 million people worldwide. Ss infection is often clinically asymptomatic and long lasting due, in large part, to the parasites auto-infective life cycle and their ability to modulate the host immune system. Th1 cells are down modulated and Th2 cells are essential for fighting against helminth infections. T cells proliferate in response to common γc dependent cytokine signaling. The role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subset distribution and the association between memory T cell subsets and the common γc cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15) in helminth infections has not been explored well. We examined the ex-vivo phenotypic profile of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets and the circulating levels of common γc cytokines in Ss-infected, uninfected and post treatment individuals. Ss infected individuals showed alterations in the T cell subset distribution and these alterations were partially reversed following anthelminthic treatment. This was associated with altered plasma levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15 and partial reversal following anthelminthic treatment. IL-7 exhibited significant positive association with central and effector memory CD4+ T cells. Our study would provide stimulus to examine further about the function of T cell subset distribution and the role and association of common γc cytokines with parasitic infections.
