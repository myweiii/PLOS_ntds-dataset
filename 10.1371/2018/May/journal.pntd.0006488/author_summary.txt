Brucellosis is an endemic zoonosis in India and recent studies demonstrate that the disease results in a median loss of US$ 3.43 billion in livestock populations. Lack of resources to compensate farmers and a ban on cow slaughter means that test and slaughter policy to control brucellosis cannot be implemented in India. This is the first systematic analysis of a brucellosis control program interventions for bovine brucellosis in India. The cost-benefit analysis was successfully conducted and indicated benefits of implementing the intervention policies. For each intervention, our results indicate that the prevalence of Brucella infection will drop below 2% in cattle after 20 years of the implementation of disease control program although some strategies were better than others. The expected net present value (NPV) was found to range from US $ 4·16 to $ 8·31 billion for cattle and from $ 7·66 to $ 13·42 billion in buffalo for the three strategies investigated. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) ranged from 3·16 to 10·62 for cattle and from 3·79 to 21·27 for buffalo. The results advocate for the implementation of a disease control program and will help development of an official health policy for the control of brucellosis in India.
