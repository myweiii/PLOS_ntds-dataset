Viral hemorrhagic fevers are known to cause high morbidity and mortality and pose a serious threat to human and animal populations in endemic countries. An outbreak of Rift Valley fever was detected in Kabale district in March, 2016 and identified the first human cases in Uganda since 1968. There was a need to perform a rapid assessment of the burden of Rift valley fever in Kabale district, identify undetected acute cases, identify risk factors associated with human disease, identify areas at high-risk or future infections, and to determine if this was a newly emerging infection or an endemic disease. Our study found the seroprevalence to be as high as 28% in humans and 36% in animals within some subcounties of Kabale district. Human seropositivity correlated with animal seropositivity, suggesting that animal to human transmission may be the predominant mode of virus spread. Our findings also suggest that this virus may have been endemic for many years prior to these human cases being identified.
