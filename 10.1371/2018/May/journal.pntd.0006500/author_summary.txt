Soil-transmitted helminths are parasitic worms that affect 1.5 billion people. The global public health strategy is regular deworming of children in endemic settings. In this study, we bring an independent dataset with over 320,000 pre-school age children across 45 STH-endemic countries to investigate the relationship between deworming and health outcomes of weight, height, and anemia. We address potential limitations of past studies by examining across diverse settings for improved generalizability, increasing sample size, and focusing on children who received treatment to improve statistical power. We find that deworming is robustly associated with reduced stunting in pre-school age children and find additional evidence that deworming may be associated with reduced anemia in sub-Saharan Africa. Deworming was not consistently associated with improved weight. These findings were robust across multiple statistical models, and we did not find consistently measurable associations with data from non-endemic settings, which improves confidence in the study findings. This global empirical analysis provides evidence to support the continued deworming of pre-school age children in endemic settings.
