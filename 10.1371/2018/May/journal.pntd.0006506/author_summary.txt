Intestinal nematodes are roundworm parasites of humans and animals, causing significant morbidity in both. In humans, these parasites are leading causes of morbidity in children, e.g., causing growth stunting, cognitive impairment, and malnutrition. Few drugs are used to treat these parasites in humans and animals and there is increasing evidence that the drugs are losing efficacy and/or have low efficacy. Infectious diseases are best treated with drug combinations and not single drugs. However, there has been little work to characterize in detail how various anti-nematode drugs combine. Here we establish a new laboratory model to study anti-nematode drug combinations using the human hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum infection in hamsters. We show that two classes of anti-nematode drugs, Cry5B and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists tribendimidine and pyrantel, combine (synergize) in a way that is more powerful at specific drug ratios than predicted from their individual impacts. Furthermore, when combined at these ratios, these combinations completely eliminated parasites at doses where normally neither drug has that effect. Horse parasites resistant to pyrantel also appear to be hypersensitive (more sensitive than wild-type parasites) to Cry5B. These characteristics predict that combinations of Cry5B with tribendimidine or pyrantel will be extremely effective therapeutically and relatively recalcitrant to the development of parasite resistance.
