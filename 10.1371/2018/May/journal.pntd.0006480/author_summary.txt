Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The persistence of the parasite leads to deterioration of the host immune response, which is known as an exhaustion process. This process affects T cell populations, leading to increased expression of inhibitory receptors that leads to a dysfunctional ability to respond to the parasite. CD4+CD8+ T cells form a poorly studied population of T cells in the context of Chagas disease. In this study, as in others previously reported, an increase in the frequency of these cells was observed in chronic Chagas disease patients. In addition, CD4+CD8+ T cells from chronic Chagas disease patients underwent stronger exhaustion processes with more severe disease pathology. A higher level of expression and co-expression of inhibitory receptors was observed in these cells in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic patients. Furthermore, we evaluated whether antiparasitic treatment affected the population of CD4+CD8+ T cells. Our results showed that after treatment, the functional capacity of these cells against the parasite improved. Concomitantly, a partial reversion of this exhaustion process occurred since the co-expression of inhibitory receptors decreased in CD4+CD8+ T cells from chronic patients after treatment.
