The annual number of new leprosy cases has been stable in the past decade, indicating that transmission has not been yet been interrupted. As current control seems to be insufficient to bring down the number of cases, there is a need for novel tools to interrupt transmission. A diagnostic that permitted diagnosis of subclinical cases will likely be fundamental to achieve elimination and ultimately eradication. In this study we assessed the minimum sensitivity level of such a (hypothetical) diagnostic test and the optimal testing strategy in order to effectively reduce the new case detection rate (NCDR) of leprosy. We showed that a diagnostic test for subclinical leprosy could substantially reduce the NCDR in a high, medium and low endemic population. A significant impact could already be achieved at a test sensitivity level of 50%. To effectively reduce the NCDR in the short run, a population survey is preferred over household contact tracing. However, this is only favorable in high endemic settings, as in medium and low endemic settings testing in a population survey requires many more people to be tested and treated to prevent one new leprosy case.
