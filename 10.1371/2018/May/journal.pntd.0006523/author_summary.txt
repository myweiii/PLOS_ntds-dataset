African sleeping sickness is caused by Trypanosoma brucei. Tens of millions of people living in endemic areas are at risk for the disease. Within the mammalian bloodstream, T. brucei parasites sustain all their energy needs by metabolizing glucose present in the hostâ€™s blood within specialized organelles known as glycosomes. In vitro, bloodstream parasites rapidly die if glucose is removed from their environment. This reliance on glucose for survival has made glucose metabolism in T. brucei an important area of study with the aim to develop targeted therapeutics that disrupt glucose metabolism. However, there have previously been no reported methods to study glucose uptake and distribution dynamics in intact glycosomes in live T. brucei. Here we describe development of approaches for observing changes in glucose concentration in glycosomes in live T. brucei. Results obtained using these methods provide new insights into how T. brucei acquires and transports glucose to sustain cell survival.
