Rift Valley fever virus is an emerging virus of public health significance. In endemic areas up to 60% of the population are seropositive by adulthood. This implies that most of the individuals living in these endemic areas become infected with this virus at some point in their lifetime. This highly prevalent virus is poorly understood likely secondary to lack of diagnostic capacity in affected areas. In fact, the majority of cases are undocumented and spontaneously resolve. However, in some individuals the disease can be very severe and at times associated with hemorrhage or encephalitis. In this report we identify three men infected during the acute stage who also exhibited hemorrhagic manifestations. These men had elevated cytokine and chemokine levels consistent with immune activation. Our data show that biomarkers of fibrinolysis correlated positively with virus while biomarkers of coagulation correlated negatively with virus, suggesting that opposing hemostatic pathways are altered during disease, and that they correct with resolution of viremia.
