    "Abstract": "Rift Valley fever virus is an arbovirus that affects both livestock and humans throughout Africa and in the Middle East. Despite its endemicity throughout Africa, it is a rare event to identify an infected individual during the acute phase of the disease and an even rarer event to collect serial blood samples from the affected patient. Severely affected patients can present with hemorrhagic manifestations of disease. In this study we identified three Ugandan men with RVFV disease that was accompanied by hemorrhagic manifestations. Serial blood samples from these men were analyzed for a series of biomarkers specific for various aspects of human pathophysiology including inflammation, endothelial function and coagulopathy. There were significant differences between biomarker levels in controls and cases both early during the illness and after clearance of viremia. Positive correlation of viral load with markers of inflammation (IP-10, CRP, Eotaxin, MCP-2 and Granzyme B), markers of fibrinolysis (tPA and D-dimer), and markers of endothelial function (sICAM-1) were all noted. However, and perhaps most interesting given the fact that these individuals exhibited hemorrhagic manifestations of disease, was the finding of a negative correlation between viral load and P-selectin, ADAMTS13, and fibrinogen all of which are associated with coagulation pathways occurring on the endothelial surface."
