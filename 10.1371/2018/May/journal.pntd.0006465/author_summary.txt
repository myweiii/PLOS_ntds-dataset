The zoonotic tapeworm, Taenia solium, affects millions of impoverished people worldwide and can cause neurocysticercosis (NCC), an infection of the central nervous system which is potentially fatal. Hypothetically, children may be a vulnerable population to infection as neurological problems and cognitive impairment caused by NCC during formative school years may lead to poor academic performance, contributing to drop-out rates and, eventually, propagating cycles of poverty. We carried out a school-based study of T. solium cysticerosis in primary school-aged children in rural western Sichuan. Our results indicate high levels of T. solium exposure in young school-aged children in rural China. While further studies to assess disease transmission within schools are needed, school-based disease control may be an important intervention to ensure the health of pediatric populations at risk for infection.
