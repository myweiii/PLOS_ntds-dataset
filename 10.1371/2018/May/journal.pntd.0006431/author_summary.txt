Malaria in pregnancy is a harsh and undesirable illness and is the cause of adverse effects on birth outcomes and on the health of women and newborns. Despite the low transmission, the predominance of Plasmodium vivax over Plasmodium falciparum and free treatment, estimated costs incurred by pregnant women seeking malaria care in an endemic area of Northern Colombia are considerable. Importantly, these costs are likely to represent only one of the constraints that women face when seeking treatment in an area characterized, at the time of the study, by armed conflict, displacement, and high vulnerability of indigenous women, the group at highest risk of malaria in the area. Important advances may result from the current peace process, potentially able to support the efforts made since the 90s to reform the health system towards achieving universal health coverage. Within this context, the current study can inform malaria elimination initiatives in Colombia.
