    "Background": "Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas disease, is monophyletic but genetically heterogeneous. It is currently represented by six genetic lineages (Discrete Typing Units, DTUs) designated TcI-TcVI. TcI is the most geographically widespread and genetically heterogeneous lineage, this as is evidenced by a wide range of genetic markers applied to isolates spanning a vast geographic range in Latin America.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "In total, 78 TcI isolated from hosts and vectors distributed in 5 different biomes of Brazil, were analyzed using 6 nuclear housekeeping genes, 25 microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial marker. Nuclear markers reveal substantial genetic diversity, significant gene flow between biomes, incongruence in phylogenies, and haplotypic analysis indicative of intra-DTU genetic exchange. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on mitochondrial and nuclear loci were incongruent, and consistent with introgression. Structure analysis of microsatellite data reveals that, amongst biomes, the Amazon is the most genetically diverse and experiences the lowest level of gene flow. Investigation of population structure based on the host species/genus, indicated that Didelphis marsupialis might play a role as the main disperser of TcI.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "The present work considers a large TcI sample from different hosts and vectors spanning multiple ecologically diverse biomes in Brazil. Importantly, we combine fast and slow evolving markers to contribute to the epizootiological understanding of TcI in five distinct Brazilian biomes. This constitutes the first instance in which MLST analysis was combined with the use of MLMT and maxicircle markers to evaluate the genetic diversity of TcI isolates in Brazil. Our results demonstrate the existence of substantial genetic diversity and the occurrence of introgression events. We provide evidence of genetic exchange in TcI isolates from Brazil and of the relative isolation of TcI in the Amazon biome. We observe the absence of strict associations with TcI genotypes to geographic areas and/or host species."
