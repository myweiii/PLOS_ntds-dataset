T. cruzi is a zoonotic protozoan parasite infecting mammals and widely dispersed throughout endemic Latin America. It is known to possess considerable genetic diversity, comprising six discrete genetic lineages designated Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) TcI-TcVI. TcI is the most genetically diverse DTU and the most frequently sampled lineage in Brazil. We use a combination of high resolution molecular techniques to analyze the genetic diversity of Brazilian TcI isolates obtained from a wide geographical area encompassing five distinct biomes isolated from different mammal hosts and insect vectors. The results reveal significant genetic diversity and no clear association of genotypes with areas or host/vector species. Evidence from incongruent phylogenetic topologies based on nuclear and mitochondrial markers are indicative of genetic exchange and/or introgression events. The relevance of these findings in the context of population structure, ecology and epizootiology is discussed.
