Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a tropical disease causing swelling of limbs (lymphoedema, elephantiasis) and male genitalia (hydrocele). It is a disabling and deforming disease caused by parasitic worms transmitted by mosquitoes. The Sri Lankan Anti Filariasis Campaign was successful in reducing LF transmission to very low levels by annual mass drug administration, resulting in recent achievement of elimination status. The other pillar of LF elimination is the management of morbidity and disability prevention (MMDP) among those with lymphatic filarial disease. The strengths, weaknesses and threats of the MMDP program were evaluated and opportunities for improvement were explored in June 2017. The filariasis clinics established in the endemic area, providing care for patients with lymphoedema and elephantiasis, were identified as the main strength. Hospital surgical units were important in the treatment of hydrocele. The weaknesses were low accessibility of clinics, incomplete coverage of endemic districts, lack of facilities for rehabilitation and lack of morbidity targets. The threats were diversion of staff and resources, under-utilization of clinics, social stigma and loss of alliances. Enhanced commitment to improve coverage and access to clinics in the endemic areas, wider publicity, referral systems, integration of MMDP into other disease management services, collaborations with welfare organizations and research groups were the opportunities identified.
