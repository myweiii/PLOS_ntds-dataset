Millions of human infections are caused by mosquito-borne diseases, so understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms that determine variability in transmission efficiency and insect susceptibility may assist with novel vector control strategies. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been studied as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in vertebrates, invertebrates, and viruses. Because interactions between vectors and parasites are the keys to malarial transmission dynamics, identifying miRNAs involved in the developmental cycles of the mosquito and interactions between the mosquito and pathogens that allow the survival, proliferation, and disease transmission may help with disease control. In this review, we summarize the research on mosquito miRNAs regarding their expression and function in various physiological and pathological processes, and explore future research in this area.
