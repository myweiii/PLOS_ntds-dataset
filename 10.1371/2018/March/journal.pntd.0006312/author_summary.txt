Mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin has become the main tool in the efforts to control and eliminate onchocerciasis (“river blindness”). In some areas, and after many years of MDA, levels of Onchocerca volvulus infection (the causative parasite) have declined greatly, and elimination appears achievable. In certain river basins of northern and central Togo, the present epidemiological situation remains unknown. The guidelines of the World Health Organization recommend that before ivermectin MDA can be stopped, interruption of O. volvulus transmission must be demonstrated. To this end, parasitological, serological, ophthalmological, and entomological assessments were conducted in the Ôti, Kéran and Mô river basins. O. volvulus infections and positive antibody responses were found in children aged ≤10 years and adults. Progressive ocular onchocerciasis was diagnosed, and parasite transmission by Simulium damnosum s.l. (the disease vector) occurred close to the survey locations. Thus, O. volvulus transmission continues in northern and central Togo, and future interventions may require approaches selectively adapted to seasonal migration of non-complying endemic populations in and out of the river basins, as well as seasonal transmission by the vectors. National control programmes should harmonize cross-border MDA as a coordinated intervention.
