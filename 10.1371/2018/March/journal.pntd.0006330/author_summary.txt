Scrub typhus is a disease caused by a mite-transmitted bacterium, Orientia tsutsugamushi. Aside from fever and necrotic skin lesion at the site of mite inoculation (eschar), scrub typhus has virtually no distinctive clinical features, making diagnosis without laboratory tests difficult. However, the laboratory tests often have limited diagnostic accuracy and are generally in limited supply in resource-limited or outpatient settings. In those settings, point-of-care testing (POCT) can be useful in making a quick diagnosis. In this study, the authors reviewed the available evidence on the diagnostic value of scrub typhus POCT. A meta-analysis, focusing on commercially available immunochromatography tests (ICTs), was done. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 66.0% (95% CI 0.37–0.86) and 92.0% (95% CI 0.83–0.97), respectively. This indicates better performance when ‘ruling in’ a positive diagnosis rather than ‘ruling out’ a negative diagnosis. As ICTs have low false positive rates, confidence in interpreting a positive result can be high. The studies reviewed displayed wide variation in both methodology and quality, indicating a need to develop standards for study methodology and reporting.
