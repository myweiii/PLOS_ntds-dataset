Human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, visceral leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) controlled or eliminated by innovative and intensified disease management (IDM). We estimated the economic impact of meeting the 2020 targets defined by the WHO for NTD control/elimination, reinforced by the 2012 London Declaration. A systematic literature review identified information on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) relating to these NTDs. The economic benefit was calculated by combining the estimated disease cases with estimated productivity losses and OPPs resulting from the diseases, from the perspective of affected individuals. Very little information about OPPs and productivity loss due to NTDs was found in the literature. The total global productivity gained by reaching the goals for the four IDM-NTDs was I$ 23.1 billion in the period 2011–2020 and I$ 35.9 billion in the period 2021–2030. The reduction in OPPs was I$ 14 billion and I$ 18 billion for the same periods. In order to estimate the economic impact of meeting the London declaration targets regarding four IDM-NTDs, we had to combine data from various sources, heterogeneous background, and variable quality. Nevertheless, based on conservative assumptions and subsequent uncertainty analyses, we estimate that the benefits of achieving the targets are nearly double the required investments by endemic country governments and their development partners to reach the 2020 targets.
