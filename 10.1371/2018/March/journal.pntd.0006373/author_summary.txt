Millions of school-age children in Kenya and Tanzania are at risk for infection with Schistosoma mansoni, which has an impact on their physical health. A total of 490 schoolchildren (163 from Kenya and 327 from Tanzania) aged 9â€“11 years living along the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya and Tanzania provided data on S. mansoni and malaria infections, weight, height, anaemia and physical fitness. The pupils in Tanzania had lower prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection compared to pupils in Kenya, but more had malaria parasites in their blood. In addition, Tanzanian pupils were taller and heavier, fewer were anaemic and they scored higher in a physical fitness test. Questionnaire data showed that more of the Tanzanian pupils knew where to wash hands after toilet visits, and more consumed animal protein (mostly fish protein) for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Multivariable analyses revealed that eating animal protein and knowing where to wash hands after toilet visits were significant predictors for haemoglobin levels and physical fitness. These results suggest that the differences in morbidity parameters may be affected by factors other than S. mansoni infection alone. Diet and hygiene practices seem to contribute to the health status of schoolchildren along Lake Victoria in Kenya and Tanzania.
