Since 2015, DENV’s cousin known as ZIKV has been in the spotlight. It caught researchers’ attention because it rapidly spread worldwide and ZIKV infection has been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome cases and congenital brain abnormalities in newborn infants. For being so closely related, differentiation between DENV or ZIKV infection is challenging. Among the assays used in viral serological diagnosis, the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that was described in the 1950s seems to be more specific, although longstanding, very laborious and not capable to test large number of samples. Therefore, we developed an image based neutralization test for ZIKV that overcomes restrictions presented by PRNT. This new test is faster, robust and able to test many samples simultaneously. It was successful in distinguish ZIKV infection from other infections, such as dengue and yellow fever. This may be especially relevant to solve cases such as congenital disorders in newborns and also to elucidate the agents involved in neuropathological outcomes such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. It also can be useful in serological surveys and vaccine studies.
