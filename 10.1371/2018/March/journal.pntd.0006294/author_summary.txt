Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. It is caused by Leptospira. Leptospira is a spiral-shaped Gram-negative spirochete with internal flagella, which enters the host through mucosa and broken skin. Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis, but it is considered underdiagnosed because of its nonspecific presentation and lack of proper understanding of its epidemiology, especially in children. In human, it can cause a wide range of symptoms in acute phase include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some of these symptoms can be observed in other febrile diseases such as typhoid fever, rickettsiosis, Kawasaki disease, and adenovirus infections. Although Leptospirosis can be deadly in severe, untreated cases, few data are available on leptospirosis in children, industrialized countries, and confirmed cases. This study conducted a population-based study to describe epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of childhood leptospirosis in a leptospirosis-endemic area in an industrialized country, Okinawa, Japan. This new knowledge may contribute to a better overall understanding of the Leptospirosis in children.
