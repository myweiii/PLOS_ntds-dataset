Infectious diseases continue to be a burden on mankind, particularly in the developing countries of the tropics. Recognition of pathogen transmission in humans is a crucial step to thwarting epidemics of these pathogens. However, sampling human blood or tissue is invasive and logistically difficult. Xenosurveillance takes advantage of the blood-feeding behavior of mosquitoes to sample human blood for the presence of infectious disease agents. In this study, we aimed to compare xenosurveillance to a more traditional sampling method to assess the usefulness of this technique in field settings where it could potentially be beneficial. DNA and RNA next generation sequencing followed by an in-house bioinformatic pipeline identified viruses and parasites of human origin in blood collected by either mosquitoes or finger-stick. Xenosurveillance produces samples of comparable quality to finger-stick blood collections while alleviating many of the difficulties of direct human sampling. This study suggests xenosurveillance can be a complimentary strategy for infectious disease surveillance in low-resource areas.
