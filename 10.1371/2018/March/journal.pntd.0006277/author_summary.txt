Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of leishmaniasis, a disease transmitted through the bite of an infected sandfly. Although the biggest burden of leishmaniasis is in eastern Africa and the Indian subcontinent, the disease is also endemic in parts of Europe. Previous studies have looked at performance of diagnostic methods, but not in great detail on samples derived from a European setting. Using a large set of samples from a national reference laboratory in Madrid, Spain, we assessed a leishmaniasis rapid test and a direct agglutination test for serological diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in Europe. Both tests were effective at diagnosing VL, but important differences were seen when testing patients co-infected with HIV or with other parasitic infections. This study can help inform which diagnostic tests are suitable for use in a European Mediterranean setting.
