Filariae are tissue-invasive parasitic roundworms transmitted by insects. In human infection, the species Brugia and Wuchereria cause leg swelling by disrupting the function of lymphatic vessels. These agents of lymphatic filariasis infect ~65 million people worldwide, causing genital and lower extremity (elephantiasis) swelling. Currently, there is a global program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis by treating all individuals living in at-risk countries with medicines against the parasites. However, these drugs do not kill adult worms when given as a short course and must be repeatedly administered once to twice a year for 5â€“10 years. Due to this limitation, there are ongoing efforts to develop new anthelmintics against the parasites causing lymphatic filariasis. Limitations with current small mammal models of lymphatic filariasis include difficulties in quantifying adult worm burdens and in assessing lymphatic vessel anatomy and function. In the 1980s it was shown that infection of ferrets with Brugia worms causes intralymphatic infection modeling human disease. Re-establishment of this model will enable us to test how well new anthelmintics work against the parasites in an intralymphatic infection model and will assist in determining whether new drugs alter lymphatic function. Here, we show that ferrets can be reproducibly infected with B. malayi larvae. We have characterized the stages of infection, and developed an in vivo technique allowing for visualization of changes in lymphatic anatomy and quantitative assessment of lymphatic function over the time course of infection.
