Lassa fever is endemic in several West African countries. However, only few hospitals and laboratories in the region have the capacity to conduct molecular or serological Lassa fever diagnostics. One reason is that the classical serological technique for Lassa fever—the immunofluorescence assay (IFA)—requires biosafety level 4 laboratories, which are not available in the Lassa fever endemic countries. In addition, IFA does not feature an objective read-out. Therefore, we established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for detection of Lassa virus-specific IgM and IgG in 96-well format, which do not require expensive equipment and can be implemented in diagnostic laboratories in West Africa. The ELISAs are based on recombinant antigen facilitating future production according to industry standards. In our evaluation, the ELISAs have shown a performance comparable to IFA. They allow in particular the diagnosis of Lassa fever patients at later stages of the acute illness. In addition, reliable serological assays, such as those described here, are urgently needed to conduct large-scale epidemiological investigations to better understand the epidemiology of Lassa fever across West Africa as well as for clinical trials evaluating novel medical countermeasures including vaccines and drugs.
