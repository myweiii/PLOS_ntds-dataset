Globally, dog-mediated rabies kills over 55,000 people on an annual basis and disproportionally affects socio-economically disadvantaged populations. For over 4 decades, the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region have worked towards the elimination of dog-mediated rabies succeeding in a substantial reduction of both human and dog rabies cases. This paper summarizes the last 15 years of the national and regional rabies elimination efforts, through a series of performance indicators, including government mass dog vaccination campaigns and post-exposure prophylaxis for humans. The most important message from the tail of the rabies epidemic in the LAC Region is one of endurance by the countries and the region to achieve rabies control and elimination. The performance indicators shown in this paper are tools for the LAC region to evaluate its progress and refine its approach, and for other regions to understand the scope of the effort required to reach elimination.
