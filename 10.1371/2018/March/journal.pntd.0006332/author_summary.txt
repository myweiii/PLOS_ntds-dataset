Parasitic worms (e.g., pinworm, roundworm, and whipworm), intestinal protozoa (e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis), and the bacterium Helicobacter pylori persist at high rates in the gastrointestinal tract of people from low- and middle-income countries. These infectious agents are increasingly paralleled by high rates of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes. We studied the association of glycemia, measured as HbA1c with common gastrointestinal tract infections among school children aged 9â€“14 years from disadvantaged neighborhoods in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Our goal was to deepen the understanding of whether specific gastrointestinal tract infections might be early life determinants of elevated HbA1c levels that might lead to diabetes. We found that the bacterium H. pylori was very common among our group of children with a positive association with hyperglycemia. None of the other infectious agents showed such an association. Additional, longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether there is causality for the observed association between H. pylori and hyperglycemia. The integration of biomarkers will allow studying mediating mechanisms.
