Treating sore throats caused by Group A Streptococcus infections (GAS pharyngitis) with antibiotics is important for preventing acute rheumatic fever (ARF). It is impossible to distinguish patients with true GAS pharyngitis infections from GAS carriers with pharyngitis caused by viral infections when throat swab culturing alone is used to diagnose GAS pharyngitis. Carriers are not likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment, but may receive treatment unnecessarily. Reported rates of GAS pharyngitis and carriage vary considerably depending on the setting. Thus it is difficult to ascertain which groups are likely to benefit significantly from active sore throat management programmes which treat GAS pharyngitis in order to prevent ARF. We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis and asymptomatic carriage in different settings. Approximately 10% of all children swabbed for a sore throat in clinical settings have true GAS pharyngitis, but this increases to around 55% if the children have GAS detected in their throat using swab cultures. In active sore throat management programmes, the prevalence of GAS detection is lower than in clinical settings and if it declines towards 8% (the asymptomatic carriage level), there may be little benefit in treating GAS culture-positive patients with antibiotics.
