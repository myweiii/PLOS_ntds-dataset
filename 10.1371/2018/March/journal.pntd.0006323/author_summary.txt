Buruli ulcer (BU) is a destructive skin and soft tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Contact with an endemic area is the key risk factor for disease acquisition. Incubation period cannot be estimated in long-term residents of endemic areas but in Victoria, Australia a proportion of our cases are short term visitors. We previously estimated a mean incubation period of 4.5 months during a sustained outbreak on the Bellarine peninsula. Since then there has been a significant increase in Victorian cases, a decline in cases on the Bellarine peninsula and the rapid expansion of a new endemic area on the Mornington peninsula. We performed a new retrospective review of 443 BU notifications between 2013 and 2016, identifying a further 20 cases with single or tightly clustered (within 1 month) exposures to BU-endemic areas. We estimated a mean incubation period in the new group of 4.8 months, very similar to our previous estimate. This knowledge assists clinicians assessing patients with compatible symptoms and a distant exposure to an endemic area, and public health practitioners seeking to prevent transmission. Our finding also suggests that the mode of transmission of BU may be similar in different geographic regions in Victoria.
