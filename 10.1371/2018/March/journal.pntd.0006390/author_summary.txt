Insecticides will continue to exert an essential role in the reduction of vector density and personal protection for a long time, especially during epidemics. In Brazil, these chemicals are extensively incorporated in national campaigns against Ae. aegypti, favoring the rise and dispersion of resistant populations. The State of São Paulo (SP), the capital (also named São Paulo) being the 5th most populated city in the world, interrupted pyrethroid application in 2000 given the high resistance levels registered. Nevertheless, SP Ae. aegypti populations remain resistant to pyrethroids with an ever increasing frequency of kdr mutations, one of the main mechanisms responsible for resistance to these chemicals. Although no longer employed by public authorities, pyrethroids are readily available on the commercial market and are extensively used by households as well as private companies, which may partially account for the high resistance ratios still in effect. All in all, it is essential to invest in basic infrastructural sanitation and community educational methods to consciously avoid larval breading sites as well as encourage the correct use of insecticides. Without this, we are fated to forfeit the efficacy of all insecticide classes as well as undermine any other new methods of Aedes control.
