Human actions have strongly altered ecosystems worldwide, through climate change, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss. The consequences of these global changes for mosquito populations could have important implications for mosquito-borne infections. Previous studies have focused on the effects of temperature from climate change, but we lack a comprehensive understanding of how ecological factors related to global change influence mosquito populations. To this end, we carried out two mesocosm experiments with the common brown house mosquito, a vector for West Nile Virus, Usutu and Sindbis. The first experiment tested how the interaction between predation and temperature affected mosquito emergence from larvae to adults; the second experiment tested how the interaction between nutrient addition and temperature affected mortality and emergence. Our results show that predator presence decreased mosquito survival and emergence, whereas nutrient additions led to an increase in emergence and a decrease in development time. Temperature and competition had no major impact. Our study suggests that, in addition to effects of climate, ecological drivers can have strong effects on mosquito populations known to transmit disease.
