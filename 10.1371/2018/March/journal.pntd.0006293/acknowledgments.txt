We extend sincere gratitude to all the staff at Mission Rabies for allowing us to conduct this study and for their assistance along the way. Special thanks go to the Mission Rabies Malawi team for their cooperation in setting up this study alongside all the preparatory work for the Zomba City drive. We are especially thankful to the education team who helped conduct the pre and post questionnaires and to Sam Chidothi who conducted the retention and control questionnaires singlehandedly.
