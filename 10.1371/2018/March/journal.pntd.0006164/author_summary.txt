We studied factors associated with the changing demographics of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Northeast Brazil, including environmental and socioeconomic determinants of disease, during the period 1990 to 2014. The incidence of VL was higher in urban areas, and regions with higher levels of canine L. infantum infection. Human males were more commonly affected than females. The incidence of VL in children under age 10 decreased during the period of study, simultaneous with increased incidence in adults. Reduction in the VL incidence among children was associated with improved socioeconomic status, administration of childhood vaccines and better nutritional status. Geographic areas with higher rainfall had higher densities of Lu. longipalpis, the primary vector of L. infantum in Brazil. VL was more frequently found in areas with indicators of poverty including sparse garbage collection and lack of urban infrastructure. During the past 25 years, HIV/AIDS has spread to areas where VL is endemic and has contributed to an increased incidence of VL-AIDS co-infection in adults.
