Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is a painful inflammatory reaction which occurs in patients with lepromatous and borderline lepromatous leprosy. The diagnosis of ENL is mainly based on clinical signs and symptoms and there is no definitive laboratory diagnosis. The causes of ENL are not fully understood but immune-complexes and T-cells activation are among the main factors described by researches. Complement C1q is a protein which initiates the classical complement pathway to form antigen-antibody complex (immune-complexes) which is normally removed before deposition. However, we do not have clear information on the role of C1q in patients with ENL reaction. Therefore, we investigated the production and gene expression of C1q in patients with ENL reaction and in non-reactional LL patient controls before and after corticosteroid treatment of ENL cases. We found that the amount of circulating C-q protein was significantly reduced in untreated ENL patients compared to non-reactional LL patients and healthy controls. On the other hand, the gene expression of C1q in peripheral blood and skin biopsies had been considerably higher in untreated ENL patients compared to LL patients controls. Both C1q protein and gene expression were not significantly different between the two groups after corticosteroid treatment of ENL cases. The decreased C1q protein in untreated ENL may indicate the consumption of C1q in immune-complex formation in these patients and suggests that the involvement of immune-complex in the pathogenesis of ENL. Hence, C1q could be used as a potential candidate marker for ENL diagnose in the future.
