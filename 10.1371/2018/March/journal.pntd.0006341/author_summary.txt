The sequelae of leprosy are diverse and include facial deformity. A characteristic facial deformity is saddle nose, and the common clinical approach to this facial deformity has been rhinoplasty. Paleopathological studies from excavated skeletal remains have revealed that leprosy also causes deformation of the maxillary bone, which supports the external nose; however, these changes have not been evaluated in living patients with leprosy. In this study, we reconstructed three-dimensional and stereoscopic images of the cranium from CT scan data and evaluated maxillary deformities both qualitatively and quantitatively. Out of the ten former patients with leprosy, three had severe deformity of the maxilla including: atrophy of the anterior nasal spine, resorption of the medial part of the alveolar process, loss of sharpness of the piriform aperture margins, and atrophy of the nasal turbinate and the septum. These changes were consistent with previous findings from paleopathological studies. We also developed a novel method for measuring the anterior-posterior length of the maxilla using 3D-CT images, with compensation for individual differences in cranial size. The calculated values are indicative of the severity of the maxillary defects as well as the thickness of bone that needs to be reconstructed to correct the deformed maxilla.
