Two types of leishmaniasis are endemic in Morocco: visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). VL is caused by Leishmania infantum, a species that is responsible for sporadic cutaneous leishmaniasis, in addition to L. major and L. tropica, which has the largest geographic distribution in Morocco. Taza province is considered as an area of mixed focus wherein VL and CL coexist. However, since the mid-1990s, this region is particularly focused upon for CL due to the presence of L. tropica. Recently, an L. infantum dermotropic variant has also been detected in CL patients. This situation calls for an in depth epidemiological investigation to identify with certainty the vectors of both L. infantum and L. tropica in this area. Our results highlight the dominance of L. infantum in cutaneous leishmaniasis patients, this species seems to invade L. tropica's field. Moreover, two phlebotomines species have been incriminated in the transmission of L. infantum, whereas the L. tropicaâ€™s vector has been confirmed. Thus, in light of our findings, the health authorities should implement control measures to counter the spread of both L. infantum and L. tropica in Taza province.
