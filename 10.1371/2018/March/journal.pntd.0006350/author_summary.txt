Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging flavivirus, is associated with severe clinical outcomes, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and birth defects. Transmission of ZIKV is primarily mosquito-borne, but the complete transmission cycle from mammalian host to mosquito and back to mammalian host has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. Here, for the first time, we establish a transmission model of ZIKV between mice lacking both interferon α and interferon γ receptor (AG129) and the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the main vector of ZIKV. We also highlight differences in vector competence among a common laboratory strain, Orlando (ORL), and two wild-caught strains, Ho Chi Minh (HCM) and Patillas (PAT), of the Aedes aegypti mosquito using oral feeding on infected mice and intrathoracic inoculation of ZIKV. Our results suggest different ZIKV susceptibility among these strains, which could be relevant as this virus spreads throughout the globe. In addition, the mosquito transmission model demonstrated here can be used to better understand the effect mosquitoes have on replication and pathogenesis of this virus.
