While World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases has proposed 2020 goals of 100% certified interruption or control of the three main forms of Chagas disease transmission (vectorial, congenital, and transfusional) in Latin America, the impact of achieving and/or missing these goals is not known. Policy makers need to know the potential impact of missing these goals on disease incidence and prevalence. If they are achieved, decision makers need to know what may be left to adequately inform policies and the future for controlling Chagas disease. Our compartmental simulation model suggests that achieving the 2020 goals would still result in 25 new acute cases per 100,000 over five years. However, substantial gains could still be garnered within one year by interrupting transmission to varying degrees, so the goals should still be pursued.
