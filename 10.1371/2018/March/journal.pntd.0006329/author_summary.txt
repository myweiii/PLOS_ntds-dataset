Onchocerciasis is endemic in certain foci in the western governorates of Yemen. Monitoring the impact of the regular ivermectin administration to affected individuals on the transmission status and providing baseline onchocerciasis estimates in endemic areas are crucial for planning effective elimination strategies. We found that the disease transmission is still ongoing in Hodeidah and Al-Mahwit governorates of Tihama region as indicated by the anti-Ov16 IgG4 seropositivity among children aged ≤10 years. In Bani Sa'ad, where affected individuals had been regularly targeted with ivermectin over the last 15 years, we found that the anti-Ov16 IgG4 seroprevalence rate was significantly lower among children aged ≤10 years (9.1%; 5/55) compared to those >10 years (24.5%; 37/151), reflecting a possible decline in disease transmission. We also revealed onchocerciasis transmission in districts with unknown previous endemicity for the first time, with rates of 8.0% and 6.1% being found in Al Marawi'ah and As Sukhnah districts of Hodeidah. Large-scale surveys are recommended for mapping of O. volvulus in human and blackfly populations in endemic foci and neighboring untargeted areas of uncertain endemicity as a forward step towards the elimination of the disease from the country.
