Scrub typhus is a febrile illness caused by bacteria that invade and live within cells of the immune and blood vessel systems. Small earth-bound mites can bite humans and transmit these bacteria into the skin. Scrub typhus is treatable with antibiotics, but currently there is no scrub typhus vaccine available. Unfortunately if humans get scrub typhus, the immune response is usually weak and short-lived, especially against different strains, and affected individuals can get ill again within a year. This is a problem in areas where the infection is very common and a vaccine could be an effective approach to protect susceptible humans against scrub typhus.
In this study, we characterized the immune response and disease features of scrub typhus in rhesus macaques by inoculating the bacteria directly into the skin–similar to the mite bite in nature–previously this had only been done in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). We found that the scrub typhus symptoms and immune responses of rhesus macaques resemble more closely the human responses than those of cynomolgus macaques. Studying the immune response in rhesus macaques will help us to understand how humans react against different bacterial proteins, to identify new markers of protection and to find the strongest vaccine candidates. This will then help us develop new and better vaccines (and also diagnostics) against scrub typhus in the future.
