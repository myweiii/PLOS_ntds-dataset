Shortly after returning from a field trip to South Sudan and Uganda in 2012, a wildlife researcher presented to the emergency room with high fever and muscle and joint pain, that later progressed to severe disease. Sosuga virus (SOSV), a novel paramyxovirus, was identified as the etiological agent. Further epidemiological investigations identified bats as the probable reservoir of SOSV. Other related bat-borne paramyxoviruses, such as Nipah and Hendra viruses, have developed into major public health issues, raising concern that SOSV could represent an emerging threat. We developed a SOSV reverse genetics system to screen antiviral compounds and identify putative therapeutic interventions. Using this system, we generated a reporter virus capable of expressing a fluorescent protein in infected cells. By incorporating the reporter SOSV into a high-throughput screening assay, we identified several compounds that inhibit SOSV replication. In addition to antiviral screening, this rescue system can be used to investigate disease mechanisms, and to contribute to development of public health interventions for threats posed by emerging bat-transmitted paramyxoviruses.
