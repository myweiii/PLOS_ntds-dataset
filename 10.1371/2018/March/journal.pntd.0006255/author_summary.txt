Leishmaniasis refers to a disease with three main types of clinical manifestation in infected individuals including cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral forms. It is caused by several species of a parasite belonging to the genus Leishmania and is transmitted by a small blood-sucking insect called a sandfly. The disease is mostly confined to the majority of the poorest countries worldwide, including Iraq, and is categorized as a low priority public health concern. The risk of the disease is exacerbated especially when suitable environments assist the sandfly and reservoir host to breed and spread and help the parasite to transfer from high incidence areas to places free from the disease. Therefore, we investigated the risk of the CL form of the disease after an outbreak in a borderline between northern and central of Iraq using the most sensitive diagnostic techniques including PCR and gene sequencing. The epidemiological, molecular and phylogenetic analyses of the parasites were studied, and we found that the parasite species Leishmania major was associated with the outbreak. Phylogeny analysis confirmed that the identified strain of the parasite matched an Iranian strain. These results indicate the risk of the disease spreading from endemic to non-endemic areas.
