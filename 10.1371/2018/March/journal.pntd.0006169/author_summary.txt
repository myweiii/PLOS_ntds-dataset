Sporotrichosis was for many years attributed to a single etiological agent, Sporothrix schenckii. However, more recently, a new emerging pathogenic species, Sporothrix brasiliensis, has been shown to cause severe cases in humans and is associated with cat-transmitted sporotrichosis. In contrast, S. schenckii is related to a sapronosis and a benign human subcutaneous mycosis. The fungal cell wall is the first point of contact between the host and the pathogen and, therefore, plays an important role in pathogenesis. The data presented here demonstrate a novel cell wall structural organization for S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii. Both Sporothrix species exhibited a bilayered cell wall structure. S. brasiliensis has a thicker cell wall, which correlates with a 30% higher chitin and 100% higher rhamnose content. Variations in the cell wall architecture in culture over time are described for both species, but these changes did not correlate with significant changes in the protein or polysaccharide content. Chitin and β-glucans, but not α-glucan, were identified in the cell walls of S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii, and a conserved rhamnomannan structure was identified. This report is the first describing the cell wall architecture of Sporothrix species and sheds new light on the high virulence and immunopathology of S. brasiliensis.
