Henipavirus infection can cause severe and often lethal respiratory and neurological disease in humans. The mechanisms by which these viruses cause disease are unknown. To characterize the mechanisms of henipavirus disease in vivo, we performed experimental infections in ferrets followed by characterization of the host response in lung and brain tissues. Characterization of the host response showed early activation of antiviral responses in the lung, in the absence of lymphocyte activation. Infection in the brain resulted in a limited breadth of the host responses, in accordance with the immunoprivileged status of this organ. Overall, infection with distinct henipavirus strains differed in magnitude of the host responses rather than activation of different pathways. Finally, we propose a model of the pathogenic mechanisms of henipavirus infection that integrates multiple components of the host responses.
