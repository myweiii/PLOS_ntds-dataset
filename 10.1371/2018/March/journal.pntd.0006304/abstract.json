    "Background": "Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been discovered in 1980 and has been linked to tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) in 1985 in Martinique. There is no data on HAM/TSP incidence trends. We report, in the present work, the temporal trends incidence of HAM/TSP in Martinique over 25 years.",
    "Methods": "Martinique is a Caribbean French West Indies island deserved by a unique Neurology Department involved in HAM/TSP diagnosis and management. A registry has been set up since 1986 and patients diagnosed for a HAM/TSP were prospectively registered. Only patients with a definite HAM/TSP onset between 1986 and 2010 were included in the present study. The 25-year study time was stratified in five-year periods. Crude incidence rates with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated using Poisson distribution for each period. Age-standardized rates were calculated using the direct method and the Martinique population census of 1990 as reference. Standardized incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs and P trends were assessed from simple Poisson regression models. Number of HTLV-1 infection among first-time blood donors was retrospectively collected from the central computer data system of the Martinique blood bank. The HTLV-1 seroprevalence into this population has been calculated for four 5-year periods between 1996 and 2015.",
    "Results": "Overall, 153 patients were identified (mean age at onset, 53+/-13.1 years; female:male ratio, 4:1). Crude HAM/TSP incidence rates per 100,000 per 5 years (95%CI) in 1986\u20131990, 1991\u20131995, 1996\u20132000, 2001\u20132005 and 2006\u20132010 periods were 10.01 (6.78\u201313.28), 13.02 (9.34\u201316.70), 11.54 (8.13\u201314.95), 4.27 (2.24\u20136.28) and 2.03 (0.62\u20133.43). Age-standardized 5-year incidence rates significantly decreased by 69% and 87% in 2001\u20132005 and 2006\u20132010 study periods. Patients characteristics did not differ regarding 1986\u20132000 and 2001\u20132010 onset periods. Between 1996\u20132000 and 2011\u20132015 study periods, the HTLV-1 seroprevalence significantly decreased by 63%.",
    "Conclusion": "Martinique faces a sudden and rapid decline of HAM/TSP incidence from 2001 in comparison to 1986\u20132000 periods. Reduction of HTLV-1 seroprevalence, that may result from transmission prevention strategy, could account for HAM/TSP incidence decrease."
