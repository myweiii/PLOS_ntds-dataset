Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was discovered in 1980 and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) was described five years later in 1985. HAM/TSP is a progressive disabling disorder characterized by spastic paraparesis with bladder and bowel dysfunction that constitutes a significant public health problem in endemic areas. Up to date, there is no efficiency treatment of HAM/TSP and prevention of HTLV-1 transmission is critical to limit the disease spreading throughout communities. In the present 25-year-study time, we report a significant decrease of HAM/TSP incidence estimated more than 70% in early 2000 compared to 1986–2000 period in Martinique a French West Indies Island. We found a trend to a significant older age at onset after 2000 (52.1 years versus 57.5 years, p = 0.06) that may reflect an age cohort effect and that could be indicative of a rapid decrease in HTLV-1 seroprevalence. We showed a significant decline in HTLV-1 infection among first-time blood donors between 1996–2000 and 2011–2015 study periods. Thus, probable HTLV-1 seroprevalence decrease secondary to HTLV-1 antibodies screening in blood donors and pregnant women and to iterative information campaigns could partly account for HAM/TSP incidence decline. This study emphasizes the importance of prevention strategies to control HAM/TSP development in HTLV-1 endemic areas.
