Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus is transmitted to humans from contact with infected livestock and through mosquito bites. Several human cases of RVF were diagnosed in Kabale District, Uganda in March 2016, over 40 years after the last RVF case was identified in Uganda. We administered a knowledge, attitudes, and practice survey to people living in Kabale District, near where the cases occurred. Survey results demonstrated that knowledge, attitudes and practice surrounding RVF could be improved within the community.
