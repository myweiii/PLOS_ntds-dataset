Both cancer cells and parasites establish a tissue microenvironment that allows for immune evasion and may reflect functional alterations of various innate cells including monocytes. In recent years, there has been a large body of evidence in the field of cancer immunotherapy demonstrating that the immune system can be retrained to not only recognize tumor cells but also to eliminate them. Tumor immunology has advanced significantly with the advent of newer tools of molecular immunology and identification of tumor associated biomarkers. In fact, the concepts for immunotherapy as an effective way to reawaken the immune response against tumors that evade the immune system may apply to other diseases. Therefore, using similar approaches in infectious diseases, might lead to activation of the immune system and reversal of immunological ignorance against parasites. We strongly believe that a multidisciplinary approach would encourage crosstalk between different areas of science and will foster and advance research. Here, we investigate how cancer cell lines and helminth parasites shape the phenotype and function of human monocytes. Both cancer cell lines and helminth parasite altered the expression of selected genes associated with inflammatory, regulatory, or type 2 response and upregulated immune checkpoints PDL1 and PDL2 in human monocytes. Our data suggest that despite the fact that helminth parasites and cancer cell lines are different, they share the ability to alter the phenotype of monocytes.
