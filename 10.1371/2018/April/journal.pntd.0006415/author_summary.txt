Leptospirosis is a globally distributed zoonotic disease that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in urban slums. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with water, soil, or mud that has been contaminated with infected urine shed from chronically infected animals. Despite the critical role the environment plays in the epidemiology of the disease, the contribution of soil to the transmission cycle remains largely undescribed. Herein, we investigated the distribution of pathogenic Leptospira in soil samples from an endemic urban slum in Brazil. We found pathogenic Leptospira in nearly one-third of the soil samples, predominantly in low concentrations (<5Ã—102 GEq/g). However, we observed considerable variation in the distribution and concentration of the pathogen at the fine spatial scale within the slum. Our results indicate that soil is likely an important additional environmental reservoir of pathogenic Leptospira in urban slums and prevention strategies should consider soil to help prevent the transmission of the disease in similar settings.
