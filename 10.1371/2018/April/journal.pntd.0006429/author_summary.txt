Buruli ulcer (BU) is a tropical infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Although being the third most common mycobacterial disease in the world after tuberculosis and leprosy, BU remains a neglected tropical disease and an emerging health emergency in several developing countries. It causes profound skin ulcerations and eventually bone infections. Life-long functional sequelae are observed in more than 20% of patients, most of whom are children. Several observations, in particular the large variability in the clinical severity of the disease after infection, suggested the role of human genetic factors in the development of BU. We report the case of a 5-year old girl from Benin, born of consanguineous parents, who suffered from extensive dissemination of the mycobacterium in the skin, bones and joints. One of her siblings was also affected. The deep genetic exploration of this family led to the identification of a small deletion on chromosome 8 in both patients but absent from unaffected siblings. Interestingly, the deletion is located within a region containing genes encoding for beta-defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides involved in both innate immunity and healing process of skin wounds. This first report of a microdeletion associated with severe BU in a large family supports the view of a key role of human genetics in the natural history of the disease.
