Vibrio cholerae is a non-invasive pathogen which causes watery diarrheal diseases both in adults and children. Natural infection with Vibrio cholerae provides protection against subsequent diseases and protection against cholera is serogroup specific. Serogroup specificity is defined by O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae. In this study, we have found that uninfected household contacts had higher baseline OSP-specific plasma IgA, IgG and IgM antibody responses than infected contacts. These observations demonstrate those plasma antibodies responses against OSP are associated with a decrease of the risk of infection of household contacts of cholera patients. We also found that OSP-specific IgG memory B cells are associated with a decrease in the risk of infection in contacts of cholera patients. This result further supports the hypothesis that immune responses targeting V. cholerae OSP is a prime mediator of protection against cholera, and suggests that future work should focus on more detailed analysis of mucosal immune responses targeting OSP, as well as evaluation of potential mechanisms of how antibodies targeting V. cholerae OSP might mediate protection against cholera.
