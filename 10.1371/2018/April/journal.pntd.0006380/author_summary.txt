Typhoid fever (TF) is a serious disease and the most common etiology of bloodstream infections in febrile patients in the Indian subcontinent. Before the advent of antibiotics its mortality rate reached up to 40%, and dropped dramatically upon their introduction. However, over the last decades multidrug-resistant strains have emerged, further posing a challenge to the treatment of TF. Here, we propose a novel treatment approach, combining azithromycin and a third-generation cephalosporin, two antibiotic agents, which act synergistically on the two niches occupied by the bacteria, the intra- and the extra-cellular compartments respectively. In our study of a rural Nepalese population with culture-confirmed TF, we have shown that dual therapy was superior to monotherapy in terms of time to defervescence and bacteremia elimination, both in outpatient and inpatient settings. We hence advocate the combination of these two antibiotics as a more effective therapeutic strategy than the current standard of care, and suggest that such approach may shorten patientsâ€™ hospital stay, and reduce both pathogen carriage rates and the development of antibiotic resistance.
