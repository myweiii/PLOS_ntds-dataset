Cholera is a severe watery diarrheal disease, caused by pathogenic strains of V. cholerae. Protective immunity against cholera is serogroup specific, and serogroup specificity is determined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Despite this, no previous work has directly assessed correlation of OSP-immune responses and protection against cholera. In this study, we assessed adult North American volunteer’s antibody responses targeting OSP after vaccination with live attenuated oral cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR, and we assessed correlation of protection against cholera with such antibody responses. Oral vaccination was associated with the induction of significant IgM and IgA responses against OSP, and these responses correlated with vibriocidal responses. There was significant negative correlation of OSP responses and post-challenge stool volume, and none of the volunteers who developed an anti-OSP antibody responses of any isotype of ≥1.5 fold developed moderate or severe cholera following experimental challenge. In summary, vaccination with live attenuated oral cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR induces antibodies that target V. cholerae OSP, and these responses highly correlate with protection against cholera.
