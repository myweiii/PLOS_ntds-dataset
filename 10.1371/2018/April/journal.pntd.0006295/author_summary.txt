After respiratory disease, diarrhea is the leading cause of death in children < 5 years worldwide. Recent multicenter studies have identified the parasite genus, Cryptosporidium to be one of the most common causes of pediatric diarrhea in resource-poor settings. In industrialized nations the parasite is well controlled through centralized water treatment facilities. Consequently, drug development targeting this neglected tropical disease has been limited. There are currently no vaccines to prevent cryptosporidiosis. Nitazoxanide is the only approved drug targeting Cryptosporidium, but it has poor efficacy in HIV positive children. Owing to the recently published multicenter findings there have been renewed Cryptosporidium drug development efforts. The calf model of cryptosporidiosis is widely recognized as the best approximation of human disease but it is difficult to execute resulting in varied experimental approaches. Here, we describe the two most common methods of executing the calf model of cryptosporidiosis and investigate how these methods impact study end-points used to inform identification of drug candidates and clinical trials. We find that confinement housing significantly increases plasma cortisol in calves and impacts key study end-points. Data collected via confinement housing may not accurately estimate drug efficacy, underscoring the need for model harmonization. The results of this study should be considered when interpreting chemotherapeutic data derived from the calf model of cryptosporidiosis.
