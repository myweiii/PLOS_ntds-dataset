Millions of people worldwide are infected with intestinal worms known as soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). These include Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus) and Trichuris trichiura. Globally, the current main strategy to control these parasites is the periodical distribution of treatment to populations which are at particular risk of infection. However, the two drugs exclusively used in these mass treatment campaigns (albendazole and mebendazole) do not perform well against some of the STH species. Adding another drug, such as ivermectin, to albendazole holds promise for improved performance. This combination is already being widely used for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis. However, policy makers need evidence that this co-administration is efficacious and safe when taken together for STH infections. To fill this knowledge gap, we systematically reviewed the scientific literature for studies on the efficacy and safety of the co-administration of ivermectin and albendazole. We identified four studies reporting on the efficacy of the co-treated and five studies assessing their tolerability. Our results suggest that the co-administration performs significantly better than albendazole alone against T. trichiura–the STH species which is most difficult to treat–and is generally well-tolerated. Yet, we conclude that definitive evidence to support the use of ivermectin together with albendazole for STH will require more high-quality studies.
