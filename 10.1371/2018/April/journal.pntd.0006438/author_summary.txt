Brugia malayi is a parasitic nematode and etiological agent of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), a mosquito-borne Neglected Tropical Disease affecting approximately 120 million people globally. Brugia and other parasitic nematodes have the ability to modulate host biology and evade the immune response but the mechanisms by which they do this are unclear. One possibility is via immunomodulatory proteins and small RNAs packaged and released in extracellular vesicles (EV) that target host cells. Here we show that all Brugia life stages relevant to human infection release EVs that are internalized by murine macrophages. These EVs contain immunomodulatory proteins and show sex-specific differences in cargo providing insight into how B. malayi establishes and maintains infection. Critically, we show ivermectin, a drug used to treat LF and related diseases affects EV release, which provides new insight into how these drugs work and identifies a new screening paradigm to help identify future anti-parasitic drugs.
