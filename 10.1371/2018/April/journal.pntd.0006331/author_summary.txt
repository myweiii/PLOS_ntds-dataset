Leptospirosis is a worldwide bacterial zoonosis which is mainly transmitted through contact with water contaminated by rodentsâ€™ urine. It manifests with various symptoms, ranging from fever and muscle pain to a severe syndrome characterized by jaundice, renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage. Outbreaks of leptospirosis after heavy rainfall and flooding have been reported, but few studies have evaluated the effect of weather factors on leptospirosis. We estimated the association between rainfall and leptospirosis cases in an urban setting in Manila, the Philippines, and examined the potential intermediate role of floods in this association. The risk of post-rainfall leptospirosis peaked at a lag of 2 weeks. After adjusting for floods, the effect of rainfall at lag 2 decreased at higher rainfall levels suggesting that flooding is on the causal pathway between heavy rainfall and leptospirosis. The results are useful for public health interventions to prepare hospitals and clinics for increased number of patients in case of an outbreak, which can help reduce the disease burden.
