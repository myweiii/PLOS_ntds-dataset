Cysticercosis (CC), caused by the larval cysts of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, is a neglected tropical disease (NTD). It is acquired when worm eggs are ingested and the developing larvae migrate through the body and form cysts in tissues. Frequent in pigs, it can also affect humans, usually when they swallow T. solium egg-contaminated soil, water or food (mainly vegetables) or through self-infection or person to person transmission when hygiene practices are insufficient. CC is the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide, and is estimated to cause 30% of all epilepsy cases in countries where the parasite is endemic.T. solium in humans has been emerging as a public health concern in Europe due to the increased number of diagnosed CC cases in recent decades. This situation has been linked to increased travels and migratory movements towards and from endemic countries. In Spain, there is no surveillance system in place. Thus, the CC disease burden remains unknown. This study provides an 18-year review of the epidemiological trends and patient characteristics in order to assess the impact of CC hospitalizations in Spain. In this way, we aimed to describe for the first time the national human CC scenario in Spain.
