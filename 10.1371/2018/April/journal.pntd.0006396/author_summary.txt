Sustainable eradication of human yaws benefits from applicable and reliable assays to detect possible reemerging yaws cases. Our study provides proof of concept for LAMP assays that are capable of rapid diagnoses and discrimination of active Treponema pallidum infection. While current clinical diagnosis is based on the clinical manifestations in combination with serology, the selected targets and LAMP assays allow for DNA based differentiation between skin ulcers caused by the subsp. pallidum (syphilis), subsp. pertenue (yaws), and the subsp. endemicum (bejel). The presented LAMP assays require limited expensive technical equipment and can be run in virtually any clinical setting. The method is thus capable of enhancing yaws diagnosis in particular in a low capacity environment.
