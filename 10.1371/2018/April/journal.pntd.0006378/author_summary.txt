Aedes aegypti is a primary vector for medically important viruses that typically resides within houses. Indoor, ultra low volume (ULV) adulticide space spraying is considered to be more effective in controlling Ae. aegypti populations than outdoor spraying, and is widely used in tropical cities. Given the widespread use of indoor ULV spraying in emergencies by municipal control programs, the lack of large spatial scale evaluations is problematic. We conducted two large-scale experiments to evaluate indoor ULV pyrethroid spraying in the city of Iquitos, Peru in 2013 and 2014, and we also evaluated a municipal spraying effort. Our results demonstrate that densities of adults can be reduced by ULV spraying, but that adult densities in sprayed areas return to approximately pre-spray densities in less than a month. These findings agree with results from previous, smaller scale experiments, and confirm that ULV spraying should be viewed as causing a short-term decrease of Ae. aegypti populations. We provide extensive detail regarding our experimental design and data collection so that our results can assist in establishing best practices for future assessments of ULV spraying efforts, as well as aid in testing predictions of mathematical models of Ae. aegypti population dynamics.
