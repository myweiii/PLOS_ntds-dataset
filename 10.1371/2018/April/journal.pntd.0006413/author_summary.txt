Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is caused by infection with nematodes of the family Filarioidea. 90% of infections are caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and the remainder by Brugia spp. In endemic countries, LF has a major social and economic impact with an estimated annual loss of $1 billion. Filarial infection can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including lymphoedema of the limbs, genital disease (hydrocele, and swelling of the scrotum and penis) and recurrent acute attacks, which are extremely painful and are accompanied by fever. As one of the leading causes of global disability, LF accounts for at least 2.8 million disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Mass drug administration (MDA) is used prophylactically on the community level where the infection is present to decrease disease transmission. These drugs have limited effect on adult parasites but effectively reduce microfilariae in the bloodstream and prevent the spread of microfilaria to mosquitoes. Use of mosquito population control strategies is supplemental to the core strategy of MDA. However, increasing insecticide resistance in mosquitoes and drug resistant nematode parasites are complicating elimination efforts and emphasizes the need for novel interventions for vector control and parasite transmission. Insulin signaling is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates growth and nutrient homeostasis in animals. Our previous work in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes showed additional roles of insulin receptor signaling in blood digestion and reproduction. The present data strongly supports our previous findings in a different mosquito species and further explores the role of mosquito insulin receptor in the development of the filarial nematode to the infective stage. This information is pertinent to ongoing efforts to control and eradicate filariasis because insulin signaling may represent a new target for the development of vector control or transmission blocking strategies.
