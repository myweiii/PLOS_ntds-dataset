Phlebotomine sand flies are the main vectors of Leishmania parasites. However, only about ten percent of the described sand fly species are proven or suspected vectors. Several factors controlling vector competence act during the early phase of infection preceding defecation of bloodmeal remnants. Sand flies of the genus Sergentomyia including S. schwetzi were repeatedly suggested to be involved in Leishmania transmission in Africa. Here, we tested the hypothesis that S. schwetzi is refractory to all Leishmania species tested due to the long persistence of the peritrophic matrix, the chitinous envelope which surrounds ingested blood within the sand fly midgut. Addition of exogenous chitinase to the S. schwetzi infectious bloodmeal led to disintegration of the peritrophic matrix which allowed Leishmania parasites to escape into the midgut and produce mature infections with colonization of the stomodeal valve and generation of infective metacyclic forms. Parasites in control flies were not able to escape from the peritrophic matrix and were lost with the defecation of blood remnants. The study strongly suggests that in S. schwetzi the peritrophic matrix forms an important barrier for the development of Leishmania parasites.
