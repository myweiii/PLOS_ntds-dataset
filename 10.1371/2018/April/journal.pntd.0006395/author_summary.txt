Ticks are important vectors for different kind of pathogens, both of medical and veterinary importance, while tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are increasing all over the world. In Turkey, many important human and zoonotic TBDs such as, Lyme borreliosis, rickettsiosis, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, bartonellosis, babesiosis, theileriosis, and hepatozoonosis have been reported. Nonetheless, there is lack of research-based information concerning the epidemiology, ecology, and vector diversity of these tick-borne pathogens. In this study, we aimed to investigate broad-range bacterial and protozoan vector-borne pathogens by PCR/RT-PCR and sequencing, those ticks infesting humans in the Corum province. Spotted fever group rickettsiae and lymphangitis-associated rickettsiae, Borrelia afzelii, Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp. were detected. Babesia microti was detected in Hyalomma marginatum infesting humans. Interestingly zoonotic pathogens like Babesia ovis, Babesia occultans, Theileria spp, Hepatozoon felis, Hepatozoon canis, and Hemolivia mauritanica were also detected, showing the role of ticks for diseases also of veterinary importance. This study provides important data for understanding the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens and it is hoped that these results will challenge clinicians and veterinarians to unify their efforts in the management of TBDs.
