Fungal biopesticides constitute potential alternative methods of vector control to tackle the rising burden of mosquito-borne diseases and the development of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Insect-fungi interactions represent an intricate co-evolutionary arms race between the invading pathogen and its arthropod host. New knowledge gathered through such studies can lead to the design of more effective microbial control strategies. Here we explored the temporospatial interaction of the mosquito Aedes aegypti with three different entomopathogenic fungi. Infection assays followed by gene expression studies revealed tissue-specific immune responses that appear to be temporal and fungal strain-specific. Our data shows that fungal infection causes significant reduction in phenoloxidase activity at the later stages of infection. The multifaceted response mounted by the mosquito against the fungal challenge appears to result in the dysregulation of midgut homeostasis, noted by an increase in midgut microbiota, especially in mosquitoes infected with the most virulent strains. Our study demonstrates an intricate mosquito-fungi interaction that, despite fungal recognition and immune response by the mosquito, results in death of the host.
