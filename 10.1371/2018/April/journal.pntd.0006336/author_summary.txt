Every year about 3 million tourists from around the world visit Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay´s triple border region where the Iguaçu Falls are located. Unfortunately, in recent years an increasing number of autochthonous canine and human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases have been reported in this area. Our study determined the Phlebotominae fauna of the region, the factors that affect the presence and abundance of Lutzomyia longipalpis and Nyssomyia whitmani; the presence of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum in different sand fly species and what Leishmania species are present. Lutzomyia longipalpis was the prevalent species and its distribution was related to the abundance of dogs. Leishmania (L.) infantum was found in Lu. longipalpis, Ny. whitmani, Ny. neivai and Lutzomyia sp. All the results are discussed within the Stockholm Paradigm and focus on their importance in the elaboration of public health policies in international border areas.
