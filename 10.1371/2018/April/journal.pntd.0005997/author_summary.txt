The intuitive response to an emerging outbreak is to halt, or at least reduce, transmission. However, in some circumstances, reducing overall transmission and incidence may be counterproductive from a public health perspective as public health interventions affect both the total level and the distribution of disease burden. We consider the scenarios under which reducing transmission of an emerging pathogen such as Zika virus may increase the costs associated with disease in the most vulnerable segments of the population—in this case, reproductive-age women. We conclude that after applying standard discounting rates to future cases, the “paradox of control” as evaluated from the time of introduction vanishes and reducing hazard of infection uniformly reduces the total costs associated with severe disease.
