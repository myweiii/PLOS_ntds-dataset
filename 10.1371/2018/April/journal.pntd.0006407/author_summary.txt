The World Health Organization considers Brazil to be a priority country for the control of leprosy. This is determined by the high rates of prevalence, detection of new cases and proportion of cases in females, proportion of cases in children, and people with degree of incapacity II. Moreover, Brazil has been unable to achieve the target of one case per 10,000 inhabitants, despite efforts to eliminate the disease. Elimination and control become even more complex challenges in border regions if we consider the heavy flow of people between countries and the resulting overload for the local health system. Thus, this study aimed to identify the risk of leprosy and its social determinants, as well as to investigate the temporal trend of the disease in a region with a triple border, connecting Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. We identified 840 new cases in the study; there was a predominance of women (n = 427, 50.8%), of white race/color (n = 685, 81.6%), age range 15 to 59 years (n = 624, 74.3%), with incomplete elementary education (n = 504, 60.0%). The social determinants income and race/color were associated with the risk of leprosy. The results may contribute to the planning of actions in health for border regions.
