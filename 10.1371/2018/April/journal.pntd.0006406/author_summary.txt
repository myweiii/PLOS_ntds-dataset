The livestock sector plays a major role in poverty and hunger reduction in the vast majority of Africa, as a source of food, cash income, manure, draught power, transportation, savings, insurance and social status. However, for livestock to play this vital role, the impact of diseases of economic and zoonotic importance need to be reduced. Bovine tuberculosis, mainly caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is such an infectious disease. Slaughterhouse (gross pathology) surveillance, followed by bacterial culture and genotyping, are options to identify the disease-causing agents, their distribution, and enabling trace back of the sources of infections, in order to prevent their re-introduction and spread. Unfortunately, genotyping is by far not generally introduced in the continent. In the present study, tissues with tuberculosis-like lesions were collected from the Asmara municipal slaughterhouse, the largest slaughterhouse in Eritrea, and bacterial culture, classical Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex typing (Spoligotyping and VNTR profiling), as well as whole genome sequencing (WGS) were used to gain insight into the spatial and temporal distribution, genetic diversity and evolution of M. bovis strains circulating in Eritrean dairy cattle. The results revealed (dis)similarities of the Eritrean M. bovis strains with the strains generally present in Africa and Europe, potential routes of introduction to Eritrea and genetic diversity of the M. bovis strains. Future in-depth molecular studies including more samples from dairy cattle as well as cattle and goats from the traditional livestock sector are recommended.
