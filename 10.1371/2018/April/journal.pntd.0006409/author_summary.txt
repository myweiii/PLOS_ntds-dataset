Yellow fever is becoming one of the most important re-emerging mosquito-borne viral diseases in many African countries despite the availability of an effective vaccine. Hence, assessing information on what a community knows about Yellow fever would contribute to the design of appropriate control strategies in addition to increasing access for vaccine. In this study, we assessed knowledge, attitudes and practices of local community about Yellow fever in South Omo area, southern Ethiopia, where outbreaks have occurred repeatedly since the 1960s. We found that the study community members had low knowledge about the cause and mode of transmission of the disease though they knew that it is a killer and affects all age groups. More than half of the study participants believed that the disease can be transmitted from a patient to another person through breathing. In the present study area, providing information to community members through community health extension workers regarding the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of this disease, and teaching what to do to minimize mosquitoes bite in understandable way would be helpful to increase their awareness about Yellow fever.
