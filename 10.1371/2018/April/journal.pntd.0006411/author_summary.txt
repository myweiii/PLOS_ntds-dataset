Goat raising is a growing industry in Lao People’s Democratic Republic however there is very little information whether or not goat raising poses a disease threat to farmers and the general population through diseases that may be transmitted between animals and humans (i.e., zoonotic diseases). To determine this, we tested goats for antibodies against two zoonotic diseases: Q fever (causative agent Coxiella burnetii) and Brucellosis (Brucella species) in Lao goats across five provinces (Vientiane Capital, Xayaboury, Xiengkhuang, Savannakhet and Attapeu). The presence of antibodies does not necessarily indicate active disease but that animals have been previously exposed to Q fever and Brucellosis. A total of 1458 goat serum samples were tested and the overall antibody positivity of the goats for C. burnetii was 4.1% and Brucella spp. was 1.4%. The highest risk of having Q fever antibodies was the goats being based in Vientiane Capital, of Boer mixed breed and ≥3 years old. The highest risk of having Brucella spp. antibodies was being based in Vientiane Capital, of Boer mixed breed as well as factors related to production system, age, and farm size. There is an urgent need to determine human health risks and economic losses caused by Q fever and Brucellosis.
