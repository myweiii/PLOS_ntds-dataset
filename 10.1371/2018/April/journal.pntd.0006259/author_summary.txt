Efforts to control the mosquito vector of malaria, Anopheles gambiae, have been dominated by the use of insecticide-treated bednets or residual spraying efforts for the previous 2â€“3 decades. The persistent use of these methods has led to a decline in control efficacy and has highlighted the need to 1) identify novel molecular targets and 2) novel translational deployment methods to control mosquito vectors. To address this, we employed biological and chemical methods to test the hypothesis that insect growth regulators (IGR) are capable of being transferred to an oviposition site at lethal concentrations when Anopheles adults are exposed immediately after blood feeding. Subsequently, we tested the hypothesis that K+ channel modulators and an IGR used in combination will reduce the mosquito population in a semi-field environment through adult toxicity and IGR transfer. The data presented in this study provides a proof-of-concept that autodissemination methods using specific IGRs and K+ channel modulators are potentially capable of reducing the burden of malaria through a method that is novel, cost efficient, long lasting, and requires minimal human intervention.
