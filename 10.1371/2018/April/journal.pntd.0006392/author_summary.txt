The increasing evidence of a relationship between ZIKV in pregnant women and fetal congenital ZIKV syndrome with microcephaly has been reported in the literature over the last two years. Our findings suggest a spatial dependency between the diseases. Therefore, using the spatial pattern of ZIKV incidence to better understand risk areas for microcephaly may help the design of surveillance policies. Brazil had a large epidemic of ZIKV, leading to several important studies of the ZIKV outbreak and its association with microcephaly. This study used a geospatial analysis approach to examine the association between ZIKV and microcephaly in Brazilian regions. It was possible to highlight a spatial association between ZIKV and microcephaly considering a time lag between diseases. Brazilian regions with the highest incidences of microcephaly were the regions where the highest incidence of ZIKV occurred months before. This finding can help the organization and planning of health services to offer better screening actions dedicated to pregnant women in high-risk areas.
