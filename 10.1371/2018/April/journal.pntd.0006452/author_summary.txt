Obtaining specific molecules having a strong association with a disease condition i.e. biomarkers, is usually a major step to developing new modes of therapy or diagnosis for the disease. In this study, samples from individuals with S. haematobium infection, some of whom had developed bladder pathologies, were compared to controls. From the blood and urine samples analysed by mass spectrometry, we highlight important human and Schistosoma haematobium metabolites, small molecules smaller in size than most proteins, which associate strongly with individuals having schistosomiasis induced-pathology or schistosomiasis alone. This report of the potential biomarkers will also add to the current understanding of the molecular events leading to schistosome associated-bladder cancer.
