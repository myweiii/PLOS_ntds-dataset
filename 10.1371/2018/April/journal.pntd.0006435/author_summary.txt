Aedes albopictus is a proven vector of more than 20 different arboviruses and, as demonstrated by experimental infections, is an efficient vector of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in several countries. In Italy this widespread species caused the first outbreak of CHIKV in Europe in 2007 (Emilia-Romagna region) and recently, after 10 years, two different outbreaks in the Central and Southern part of the country (Latium and Calabria regions) were reported. Symptoms of CHIKV are arthralgia and joint pain, skin rash, primarily of the trunk and limbs, but also commonly fever and myalgia. Complications of this disease are rare, but long-term sequelae often occur in a considerable number of patients in particular, in children, the elderly, and patients with chronic diseases. The recent circulation of CHIKV in Italy has highlighted the importance of investigating vector competence of Italian populations of Ae. albopictus from different areas. In this study, we experimentally infected several mosquito populations in order to assess the real risk of CHIKV epidemics in temperate zones and support efficient surveillance and control strategies.
