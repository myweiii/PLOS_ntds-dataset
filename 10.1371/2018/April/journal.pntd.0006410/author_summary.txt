In this work, we confirm previous reports that the repertoire of tick salivary gland transcripts changes as a function of time, but in addition, we now identify transcripts that change their levels according to the mode of feeding of ticks. Implementation of membrane feeding allowed us to feed ticks on an immune-deficient diet and identify transcripts that are subject to immunity-stimulated expression. Such identification may help to prioritise selection of salivary gland transcripts for further investigation. One novelty of this work was creating cDNA libraries from a single pair of salivary glands, which helped to gain insight into sialomic diversity at the single tick level. We observed that ticks express a battery of genes in defined clusters as feeding progresses (over tested replicates), but also individual ticks were found to express idiosyncratic clusters of genes. Such a biological phenomenon may imply novel tick mechanisms for evading host-mediated recognition of tick antigens.
