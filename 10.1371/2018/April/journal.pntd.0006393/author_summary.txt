We report here a novel immunotherapy for cost effective and simple treatment of Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease of global importance. The two main novelties of this work which have important implications are the following: Plasma RNA (specific to Brucella abortus in this case) has been used as a biomarker for the first time to successfully monitor the efficacy of an antibacterial therapy (in this case, immunotherapy of brucellosis). There is no published report of such a biomarker for monitoring the therapy in Brucellosis or any other bacterial infection. Bacterial counts in spleen and other organs before and after phage therapy (after sacrificing) have been used in mice. However, this is not applicable in cattle and humans. Therefore, this novel application of a specific biomarker for periodic minimally invasive and non destructive monitoring of the efficacy of antibacterial therapy could be very useful in Medicine. The phage lysate of RB51 strain of Brucella abortus has been successfully used for immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle for the first time. Although S19 lysate has been used earlier in mice for prophylaxis, it induces only antibody and not cell mediated immune response which is essential for protection against intracellular pathogens like Brucella.
