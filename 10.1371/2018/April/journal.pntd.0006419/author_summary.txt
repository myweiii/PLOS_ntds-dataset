Colombia is among the countries with the highest number of Tegumentary Leishmaniasis cases worldwide. Despite public health efforts, and the existence of a national epidemiological surveillance system, articulated with the regional SisLeish system, the trends followed by the disease’s prevalence and incidence have not been explored. This work presents a retrospective analysis of Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in Colombia between the years 2007 and 2016, depicting the spatiotemporal distribution of the disease throughout the Colombian territory. The results show a sustained transmission rate, especially in the Amazon and Orinoco regions, and high intraregional variability that could be attributed to each region’s characteristics (vector species diversity and low adherence to preventive measures). The Amazon region is of particular importance due to its direct connection to other endemic countries such as Peru and Brazil. This connection highlights the need to prioritize the implementation of control and prevention strategies in this region. The surveillance system displays multiple flaws, which contribute to under-reporting and have a direct impact on the regional system. Strengthening the system should become a key public health objective in the country. The results of this research can contribute to the understanding of the transmission dynamics of Leishmaniasis in Colombia, as well as to the bolstering of public policy efforts in towards prevention and control of the disease.
