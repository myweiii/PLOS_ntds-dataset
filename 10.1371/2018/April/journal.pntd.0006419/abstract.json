    "Background": "Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) is a neglected disease with worldwide distribution and considered a public health problem, especially in Latin America. In Colombia, the governmental epidemiological surveillance system (SIVIGILA) is responsible for collecting information on the presentation of cases of TL from each of the municipalities and departments. In absence of a study compiling and analyzing currently available metadata of TL in Colombia, this study describes the geospatial-temporal distribution of TL and identifies the regions of the country on which prevention measures should be established in order to control the disease.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "This is an exploratory descriptive analysis of the distribution of TL in Colombia. Information was collected on new cases of the disease during the years 2007\u20132016 from the Colombian reporting system (SIVIGILA). Incidence calculations were made based on population estimates by departments and biogeographical regions. Time evolution is shown in biennial maps. A 10-year series was analyzed, showing that the Amazon region is the most affected in terms of incidence, while the Andean region has the highest number of cases with a high variability among the departments that make it up. In those departments where there is a greater reported diversity of vector species, a large number of cases was observed.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "Transmission dynamics of TL in Colombia in the past 10 years have been variable, with a greater concentration of cases in the central and southern departments. The present study contributes to improve the understanding of the patterns of distribution of TL in Colombia and can be a basis for future studies of impact evaluation of Health policies in the country and the region."
