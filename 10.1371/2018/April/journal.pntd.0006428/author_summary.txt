The liver fluke F. hepatica imposes an economic burden by infesting domestic ruminants. In addition, the WHO classified human fasciolosis as a disease of vital global public health importance, because several million people worldwide are infested by this trematode. Because it is currently not possible to vaccinate against this parasite, anthelmintic drugs are the treatment of choice for both, animals and people. During the last decades, the proportion of flukes resistant to drugs has steadily increased. F. hepatica persists in the hostile environment of the host bile duct. Accordingly, the fluke must be endowed with defense mechanisms, which protect it against the toxic actions of bile acids. This working hypothesis was explored by cloning a candidate taurine transporter of F. hepatica. The experiments verified that the transporter mediated the sodium- and chloride-dependent uptake of taurine. It requires only low concentrations of chloride, which indicates adaptation to the ionic composition of the bile, and it is protective: inhibition of the transporter renders flukes susceptible to killing by bile acids. By showing that the taurine transporter represents an Achilles heel of F. hepatica, these observations point to a new anthelmintic therapeutic strategy.
