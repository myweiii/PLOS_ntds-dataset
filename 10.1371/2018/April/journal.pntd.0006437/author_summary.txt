Mycetoma is a poverty-associated disease that was recently recognised as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This disease can be caused by either bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). The most common causative agent of mycetoma is the fungus Madurella mycetomatis. Actinomycetoma can be easily treated, but for eumycetoma, the current and only antifungal drug used is only able to successfully treat 30% of patients. Treatment often involves prolonged medication use and amputation of the affected area. This disease is disfiguring and is a social stigma for patients in endemic countries. To improve treatment for patients, we have looked at over 800 diverse drug-like molecules and compounds in hope to develop new drugs in this study. We have identified 215 compounds with activity against M. mycetomatis in vitro and several in vivo with our Galleria mellonella larvae model. We have chosen an open source approach with this study and placed our findings in an online database and made it available to the public. We invite the global scientific community to participate in our study and contribute as equal partners as long as an open source approach is held in hopes to fast track and boost drug discovery for Eumycetoma.
