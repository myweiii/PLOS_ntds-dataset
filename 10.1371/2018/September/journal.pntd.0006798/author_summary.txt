Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected chronic parasitic infection of great interest in public health, because it is preventable and has serious complications. In Brazil, despite the success obtained by controlling transmission by the T.infestans vector and by transfusion screening, the disease still affects more than 4 million people, with 6000 annual deaths. Studies that evaluate mortality from CD are an important indicator of the impact of the disease. However, studies in Brazil have not evaluated the effects of age, period and birth cohort (APC effects) separately to understand the importance and particularity of aspects related to the evolution of CD mortality over time. This study estimated the APC effects by sex and geographic region of Brazil in the period from 1980–2014 and estimated the mortality rates for two more decades (2015–2034). Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, significant differences in temporal effects were found. The main findings were as follows: a) a progressive increase in the rate of CD death with increasing age, up to 30 years, with the highest mortality between 50 and 64 years; b) a generational effect, with a lower rate of death for younger cohorts; c) a reduction in the rate of CD death for the Central West, South and Southeast regions no statistical effect in the Northeast region, and increased risk in the North region since 2000; and d) a reduction in the mortality rates for the next 20 years, with rates being highest among the youngest age group. These results suggest the importance of the period effect on Chagas disease prevention and control measures, in addition to the expansion of health services access and the migration from endemic areas to non-endemic areas that has reduced population exposure to T.cruzi infection, especially in birth cohorts after the 1960s. In addition, differences among the regions of the country reflect the association of disease mortality with socioeconomic status, as well as inequities in access to healthcare by the Brazilian population.
