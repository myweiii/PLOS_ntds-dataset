Human brucellosis (HB) is a bacterial zoonosis more frequent in low income and middle-income countries. The number of cases has increased in Southern Brazil since 2014. Considering the risk of dissemination of the disease, the authors evaluated the whole spectrum of the disease in the State of Paran√°, where cases were reported. More than 3,500 patients at risk for the disease were evaluated and 754 presented with positive blood test results for human brucellosis. The local Health Agency established a program of brucellosis treatment and prevention in the following year. After the intensive control program, there was a significant reduction in the number of HB cases.
