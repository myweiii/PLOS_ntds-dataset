Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a helminthic zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato. CE diagnosis and monitoring is of paramount importance for the clinical management of patients and primarily rely on imaging techniques, complemented by serology. CE serology is usually based on the detection of antibodies against hydatid fluid (HF), but the use of this heterogeneous antigenic mixture shows several drawbacks, including false positive and negative results, unsatisfied predictive values, and long persistence of detectable antibody levels in cured patients. As an alternative, to improve test performances and standardization, several recombinant antigens have been described, but these have been so far evaluated only on a limited number of samples. Here, two recombinant antigens derived from one of the immunodominant HF antigens (antigen B2) have been tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in immunochromatographic strips (IC) against 721 serum samples. Although more specific than the HF, the recombinant antigens in ELISA showed low sensitivity for patients with inactive (CE4 and CE5) cysts and for patients not subjected to drug treatment. This limited their use for follow-up, although promising, to those patients with positive serology at the beginning of the follow-up period. These results will aid in the future development of a serological test with enhanced performance in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with CE.
