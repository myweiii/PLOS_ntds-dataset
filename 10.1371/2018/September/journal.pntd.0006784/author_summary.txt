Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ots) frequently causes severe scrub typhus infections in the Asia-Pacific region. Korean investigators had previously demonstrated that Ots encodes five different cell surface (Sca) proteins which have functional regions that mediate their transport to the cell surface. One of the proteins (ScaA) is able to serve as a vaccine against a Korean strain of Ots. Several of the Sca proteins stimulate production of antibodies during scrub typhus infections in humans. However, very little was known about the distribution of the Sca protein genes in isolates of Ots in other countries in the Asia-Pacific region where scrub tyhus occurs. We discovered there is a sixth gene scaF in some Ots strains. We designed sensitive molecular assays from conserved regions of each protein to survey the presence of the six sca genes in 178 DNAs from isolates from 12 countries. Only four sca genes are widely distributed among diverse Ots isolates from diverse geographical areas. scaB and scaF were detected much less frequently in Ots isolates. Future studies will be required to determine whether the Sca proteins are suitable for improved diagnostic assays and vaccines for scrub typhus.
