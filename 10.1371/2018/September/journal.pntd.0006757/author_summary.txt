Buruli ulcer, a mycobacterial infection resulting in destructive soft tissue lesions, has been increasing in incidence in southeastern Australia over recent years. Exact transmission mechanisms and therefore preventative measures remain unclear. We aimed to investigate a possible link between Buruli ulcer and rainfall for two major endemic areas of the state of Victoria; the Bellarine and Mornington Peninsulas. Our results demonstrate a positive correlation with rainfall on the Bellarine Peninsula with a prior rainfall lag of 12 months but no correlation on the Mornington Peninsula. Established time-frames such as the incubation period and average delay to diagnosis (due to slow and often asymptomatic progression of the disease) make up a total of at least 5–6 months. On the Bellarine Peninsula, there appears to be another 5–6 months of unaccounted time from rainfall to transmission of the pathogen. This provides a basis to explore previously proposed transmission mechanisms which, based on the discrepancy noted with rainfall correlation, may differ between endemic regions.
