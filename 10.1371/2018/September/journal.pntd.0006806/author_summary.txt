Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal disease occurring in Latin America and more prevalent in South America. The disease is caused by the dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides spp., its pathogenesis is multifactorial and few virulence factors have been recognized in this fungus. Some virulence factors, like the secreted aspartic proteases (Saps), have been described playing an important role in adhesion, invasion and tissue damage in many pathogenic microorganisms. Thus, the inhibition of one of the many infection stages may contribute to the containment of the pathogen and thus should help in the treatment of disease. We have here produced an aspartyl protease recombinant of Paracoccidioides (rPbSap) and shown that rPbSap-immunized mice decreased disease progression. Besides that, when infected mice were treated with an aspartyl protease inhibitor we also observed a significant reduction of fungal infection. In addition, PbSap expression was modulated by different stress conditions, especially in low pH environment. These findings provide insights for the design of new antifungal therapies for this important fungal disease.
