PKDL is a sequel of VL, which acts as a source of leishmaniasis and should be diagnosed and treated at the earliest possible time to prevent disease transmission. In Bangladesh during the period from May 2016 to October 2017, a total of 5 patients were diagnosed to have Miltefosine induced unilateral ophthalmic complications. Miltefosine was introduced as an anti-parasitic drug through drug repurposing, and it has a complex mechanism of acting towards the parasite killing. The mechanism itself in certain circumstances may produce ophthalmic complications by its metabolites or by causing dry eye disease. Miltefosine is the only oral drug for leishmaniasis. Hence the etiopathogenesis and prevention strategy of such severe adverse events must be explored.
