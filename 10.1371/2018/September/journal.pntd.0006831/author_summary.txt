Glossina swynnertoni is restricted to open savannah in northwestern Tanzania and southwestern Kenya whereas G. morsitans centralis has a much wider distribution from western Tanzania/southern Uganda westwards through Zambia and southeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Angola. Both are savannah tsetse and are efficient vectors of human and animal trypanosomiasis. In comparison to other tsetse species, relatively little work has been done to test the efficacy of traps and targets for controlling G. swynnertoni and G. m. centralis. To determine the most visually-attractive and practical objects we conducted field tests with devices of various shapes, sizes and colours in Tanzania, DRC and Angola in different years, seasons, environmental conditions and at different population densities. The strongest landing responses were on 0.5 m2 horizontal rectangular targets with respect to ground that had both black and phthalogen blue elements with fly landing rates not significantly lower than on equivalent 1 m2 targets used till now for both species. The pyramidal trap proved efficient as a landing stimulus as targets of either size for G. m. centralis. Insecticide-impregnated blue-black 0.5 m2 cloth targets show promise as cost-effective devices for management of G. swynnertoni and G. m. centralis populations.
