A. aquasalis is an important natural malaria vector in the Americas, where most malaria cases are due to P. vivax. There is little information on both the insect and the parasite. One of the difficulties of working with P. vivax is the impossibility of culturing this parasite continuously, reason why our studies were performed using blood from malaria patients collected in the Amazon region. We have previously detected differences between the responses of A. aquasalis to P. vivax infection in relation to better studied mosquito-Plasmodium pairs, stressing the importance of studying different systems, since the development of new malaria transmission-blocking strategies may be insect/parasite-specific, and also have geographical specificities. In the present manuscript we demonstrate that the transcription factor GATA-Serpent is a key player in controlling parasite and bacteria development in these mosquitoes. Our data provide new insights into the GATA-Serpent-mediated mechanisms that regulate the A. aquasalis immune response against P. vivax and the first evidence of hemocytes involvement in this process.
