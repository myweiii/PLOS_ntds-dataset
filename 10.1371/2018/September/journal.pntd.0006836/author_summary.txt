Chagas disease is a chronic neglected tropical disease that has increased in prevalence in the last decade. About 10% of chronically infected patients develop the digestive form of the disease. Megaesophagus is a common manifestation, and symptoms include difficulty or discomfort in swallowing and regurgitation. Treatment approaches include dietary interventions, medications, and endoscopic and surgical interventions. Regarding pharmacological treatment, only a few small studies have evaluated the effects of isosorbide and nifedipine, mainly on surrogate outcomes. According to our systematic review, the use of isosorbide reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure, esophageal retention after meal ingestion, and the frequency and severity of dysphagia, while nifedipine reduced esophageal retention after meal ingestion. In light of this, both medications are effective in the treatment of symptoms associated with Chagas disease. Isosorbide appears to be more effective, and its use is supported by a larger number of studies; nifedipine, however, appears to have a better tolerability profile. Both drugs are valid alternatives, and the decisions about pharmacological treatment should be tailored to each patient.
