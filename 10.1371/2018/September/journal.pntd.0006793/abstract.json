    "Abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic shock syndrome. Dengue vaccine development is challenging because of the need to induce protection against four antigenically distinct DENV serotypes. Recent studies indicate that tetravalent DENV vaccines must induce balanced, serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies to achieve durable protective immunity against all 4 serotypes. With the leading live attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccines, it has been difficult to achieve balanced and type-specific responses to each serotype, most likely because of unbalanced replication of vaccine viral strains. Here we evaluate a tetravalent DENV protein subunit vaccine, based on recombinant envelope protein (rE) adsorbed to the surface of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles for immunogenicity in mice. In monovalent and tetravalent formulations, we show that particulate rE induced higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to the soluble rE antigen alone. Importantly, we show the trend that tetravalent rE adsorbed to nanoparticles stimulated a more balanced serotype specific antibody response to each DENV serotype compared to soluble antigens. Our results demonstrate that tetravalent DENV subunit vaccines displayed on nanoparticles have the potential to overcome unbalanced immunity observed for leading live-attenuated vaccine candidates."
