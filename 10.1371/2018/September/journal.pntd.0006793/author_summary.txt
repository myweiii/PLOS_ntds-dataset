Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Yearly, over 350 million individuals in over 120 countries are infected. To establish protection through vaccination, one must induce simultaneous immunity against four antigenically distinct DENV serotypes. However, this is challenging because it has been shown that vaccination can enhance disease due to specific immunity to the virus. As an alternative to existing vaccine platforms, we are exploring the potential of a protein subunit vaccine using only the DENV envelope protein (E) as the vaccine antigen. To increase the immunogenic potency of E, we attach it to nanoparticle carriers. For each individual DENV serotype, we show that we can enhance immune responses in monovalent as well as tetravalent formulations when E is attached to nanoparticles. Additionally, in tetravalent nanoparticle formulations, vaccine quality is increased by the generation of a more balanced serotype specific immune antibody response to each DENV serotype. The nanoparticle vaccine platform described here for DENV vaccines serves as a promising and safe alternative to more conventional vaccine platforms and can be modified to develop vaccines for other viral pathogens such as West Nile, yellow fever virus or Zika virus.
