Trypanosoma cruzi is a hemoflagellate that is now considered a global health threat in all industrialized regions of the world. Some chagasic patients present with digestive, neurological, and/or cardiac disorders. The mechanisms of T. cruzi-induced pathology remain to be elucidated. In this study, we challenged primary human colonic epithelial cells with T. cruzi and evaluated changes in the phosphorylated kinases and phosphoprotein levels that may induce cellular and molecular alterations leading to cellular transformations during the early phase of infection. The parasite induced significant increases in levels of phosphorylated kinases and phosphoproteins that govern multiple cellular pathways associated with immunological, stress, neuronal, and intercellular interactions as well as fibrogenic responses. The parasite also enhanced the levels of p-AKT, p-HSP27, p-JNK, and downstream transcription factors like p-c-Jun and p-CREB during the early infection phase. Additionally, we observed that the phosphorylated transcription factors are translocated to and colocalized in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner. These transcription factors regulate the expression of genes, including genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins, which play a role in the onset of colon pathology observed in some chagasic patients. Our study provides novel insights into the interactome that occurs during acute phase of T. cruzi infection of primary human colon cells.
