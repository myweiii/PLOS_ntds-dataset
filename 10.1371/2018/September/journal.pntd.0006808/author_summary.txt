Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium leprae and is one of the major causes of preventable disability. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of all new cases of leprosy remain the key strategies for leprosy control as it would prevent nerve damage, disability and reduce the transmission of the disease. People affected by leprosy often experience severe stigmatization because of an adverse social judgment about the disease or its disabling consequences. This neglected tropical disease continues to pose a major disease burden in India. Despite the availability of health facilities there continue to be barriers towards leprosy diagnosis and early treatment. Assessment of attitudes of health care professionals is important as negative attitude could constitute a major deterrent to care-seeking by persons affected by leprosy. Researchers developed and validated a culturally appropriate scale to measure attitudes of health care providers towards persons affected by leprosy in Tamil Nadu, India. The scale would be useful to obtain insights of attitudes of health care professionals to plan appropriate programmes that would help to promote positive attitudes of healthcare providers towards persons affected by leprosy.
