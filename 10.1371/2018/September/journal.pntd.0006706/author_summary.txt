Leprosy is one of the oldest reported infectious diseases in the history of humanity, with a remarkably high rate of active transmission still reported annually, but mainly in resource-limited endemic countries. The primary tool for leprosy transmission prevention is diagnosing the disease at an early stage. However, this is challenging in resource-limited disease-endemic countries with the currently available microscopic diagnostic tests. We found that Auramine O staining can alternatively be used for leprosy diagnosis using light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy on both in slit skin smears and tissue section samples with a potential of replacing the routine light microscopic examination. We have also showed that a combination of highly efficient DNA extraction steps with a single run of conventional PCR out performed the standard microscopy methods for all samples with high and low bacillary index.
