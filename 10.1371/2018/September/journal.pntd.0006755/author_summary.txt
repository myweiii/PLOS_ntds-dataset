Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that is most prevalent among the emerging arboviruses. Most patients recover from dengue without complications, but a small portion of cases may progress to severe dengue which carries a high mortality rate if left untreated. In 2014, a dengue outbreak unexpectedly occurred in Tokyo, which was the first time in 70 years for Japan to experience an autochthonous transmission. Thus, preparation for dengue and other emerging infectious threats is essential even in places where these outbreaks have been largely unknown. Tokyo will be hosting the Olympic and Paralympic games in 2020, and interventions are warranted to mitigate the risks. We modified and adapted the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) methodology to test the vulnerability and resiliency of the current controls. Although the FMEA methodology is generally used in industrial manufacturing, it has the potential to be utilized for health preparedness for other infectious diseases as well. Our analysis identifies three strategies to reinforce early detection of dengue infection and prevent further transmission during the Olympic and Paralympic Games.
