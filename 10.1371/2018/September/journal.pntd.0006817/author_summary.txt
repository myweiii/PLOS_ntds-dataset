The study highlights interesting relationship between viral factors and clinical manifestation of dengue disease during an outbreak. The viral factors which include serotype and genotype of dengue virus were studied to discover if the clinical manifestation in patients were serotype and genotype-specific. As most clinical symptoms of severe dengue infection only manifest at a much later stage of dengue infection, therefore, information on serotype or genotype-specific dengue manifestations may serve as early surrogate markers to predict disease progression. We found that specific clinical manifestations were over-represented by a specific DENV serotype and genotype. Severe dengue was significantly present in DENV 2 Cosmopolitan-infected group while non-severe dengue was prominent among DENV 1 genotype I-infected patients. DENV 3-infected patients commonly manifested musculoskeletal symptoms. This study was undertaken between 2014 and mid-2017, which was considered to be crucial, given that Malaysia experienced an unprecedented outbreak of dengue during this period. Consequently, the occurrence of serotype shift and possible re-emergence of DENV 3 genotype I were reported.
