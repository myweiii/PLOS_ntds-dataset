Melioidosis is a serious infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative environmental bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei. Infection in humans occurs following skin inoculation, inhalation or ingestion. The recommendations for melioidosis prevention include using protective gear such as rubber boots when in direct contact with soil and environmental water, and drinking only boiled or bottled water. A multifaceted prevention programme is recommended to achieve the desired behaviour changes. Here, we evaluated the feasibility and behavioural outcomes of a multifaceted prevention programme for melioidosis. Our study participants were diabetic adults in Ubon Ratchathani, northeast Thailand. We found that the multifaceted prevention programme was highly acceptable to participants, and could support behaviour change. A calendar with an individual photograph as a reminder tool engaged participants effectively. Our study also confirmed that commitment and action by the government are essential for the preventive interventions to be successful. We recommend that policy makers should consider implementing the programme in areas where melioidosis is endemic. Since cultures and barriers to adopting the recommended behaviours vary, the intervention strategies would need to be adapted to local contexts.
