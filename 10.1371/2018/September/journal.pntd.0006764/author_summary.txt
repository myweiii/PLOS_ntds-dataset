The huge worldwide expansion of Chagas’ disease (American trypanosomiasis) that has occurred as a result of the population mobility from Latin America, has caused this parasitic disease to become an important topic for the World Health Organization. Cases of Chagas’ disease have been reported in the United States and Canada, as well as in Europe and the Western Pacific. The efficacy of current drugs (nifurtimox and benznidazole) to treat this disease is limited. Besides, these drugs cause adverse effects. For these reasons, a continuous research to find therapeutic alternatives is required. In our laboratory, we evaluate the anti-Trypanosoma cruzi effect of both synthetic and natural products. Promising results have been obtained in our laboratory when the effect of vitamin B12 was tested on infected mice. As a continuation of that work, herein we evaluated the effects of the combined treatment of vitamin C and benznidazole as a therapeutic alternative. Vitamin C was found to diminish the cytotoxicity of the antichagasic drug.
