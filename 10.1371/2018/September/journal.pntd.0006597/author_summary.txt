Dog-mediated human rabies causes tens of thousands of human deaths annually in economically disadvantaged countries. The disease is almost invariably fatal once symptoms appear but can be prevented if post-exposure prophylaxis is received within a few days after the exposure. Canine rabies is endemic in Cameroon but inadequate surveillance has meant the extent of the disease is unknown and underappreciated. In 2014, reinforcements were made to the rabies surveillance network in the West region of Cameroon. The reinforced surveillance network was formed of local, regional, and national health and veterinary authorities and collected information related to suspected rabies exposures, prophylaxis administration, and outcome. This study described the findings from the reinforced network and provided the most reliable estimate of the regionâ€™s disease burden to date. The study also highlighted that improved access to life-saving prophylaxis is needed for bite victims of suspected rabid animals. The findings from this study will help implement a new nationwide surveillance system in Cameroon.
