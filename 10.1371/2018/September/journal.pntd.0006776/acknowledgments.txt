We would like to thank the district health management teams for their support towards the study. This study could not have been carried out without the support of the sub-district peripheral health facilities, which served as referral points for suspected cases; here we will like to make a special mention of Mr. Cyrus Tetteh, the Medical assistant at Kojo Ashon. We are grateful to the Research Assistants for survey data collection, chiefs, elders and participants in the study communities for their participation in the study without which, there would have been no study.
