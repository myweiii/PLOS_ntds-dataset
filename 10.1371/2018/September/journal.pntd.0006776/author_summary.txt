The study revealed that it is feasible to train periphery health workers and community-based volunteers to implement a community-based active surveillanceâ€“response system for early buruli ulcer (BU) case detection, diagnosis and treatment at outpatient clinics. At the end of 12 months follow-up, there were 36084 surveillance person contacts made with physical bodily examination done on 93.77% of them. The average surveillance contact per person was 11.3 (91.7%). We believe that this was achieved largely because of the use of community-based volunteers for the surveillance visits. Given the high number of non-BU skin lesions detected during the surveillance period, it is recommended that any BU surveillance-response system must be an integrated one to aid the detection, diagnosis and treatment of other skin conditions to make it more cost effective, this has become even more imperative because the number of BU cases have been declining in most endemic communities in Ghana, since the introduction of antibiotics treatment.
