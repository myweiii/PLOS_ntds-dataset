Typhoid fever was successfully controlled in Santiago, Chile, after a series of interventions including vaccination with a live oral vaccine (Ty21a), and an environmental sanitation improvement, when a ban was put on the irrigation of salad vegetable crops with untreated sewage. Data collected during this period inform seasonality, age distribution and longitudinal trends of disease. We developed an individual-based, mathematical model to both simulate the dynamics of typhoid seen in Santiago, as well as to investigate relative impacts of the vaccine and sanitation interventions. We found that herd immunity resulted from field trials of the Ty21a vaccine and that chronic carriers were a likely driver of sustained transmission at low incidence levels. Modeling typhoid fever in areas that have demonstrated successful control provides insight for control strategies in modern settings.
