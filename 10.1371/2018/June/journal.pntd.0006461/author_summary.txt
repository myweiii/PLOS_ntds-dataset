The scale of the 2014–15 Ebola epidemic was unprecedented and led to over 11,000 deaths in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. What is distinct about the findings of this study is the knowledge gained from experiences and reflections of communities, health workers and Ebola survivors living in the midst of an outbreak of this magnitude. To this point cultural practices were seen to both spread the disease and hinder response efforts, yet little was known about how and why affected communities engaged with Ebola control measures. We talked with people to understand their perspectives with the aim of improving responses to future disease outbreaks. Our findings show people believed ‘Ebola is real’ and adapted to control measures when they were directly affected by the disease. Factors supporting acceptance of and adherence to controls were treatment quality; proximal care; first-hand observation that people can survive the disease; and the participation of local leaders and community knowledge in the response. Dignity, respect, and compassion were essential for control measures to be accepted and effective. Health messaging is best conducted at household level through local leaders or people who have experienced Ebola first-hand, rather than mass media which was the initial approach.
