We would like to acknowledge Rob Broeder's tireless devotion as a humanitarian to public health in emergencies, including HIV/TB and more latterly managing the medical response to Ebola in Sierra Leone. He was an inspiration to us all. We thank Sarah Venis (Medical Editor MSF UK) for editing assistance; Isha Koroma, Abdul Pascale Gba, and Mahawa Agatha Kamara for translation; and MSF/MoH project teams for their assistance in Tonkolili and Freetown, Sierra Leone.
