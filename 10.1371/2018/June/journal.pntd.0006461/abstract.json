    "Background": "During the West Africa Ebola outbreak, cultural practices have been described as hindering response efforts. The acceptance of control measures improved during the outbreak, but little is known about how and why this occurred. We conducted a qualitative study in two administrative districts of Sierra Leone to understand Ebola survivor, community, and health worker perspectives on Ebola control measures. We aimed to gain an understanding of community interactions with the Ebola response to inform future intervention strategies.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "Participants (25 survivors, 24 community members, and 16 health workers) were recruited purposively. A flexible participatory method gathered data through field notes and in-depth, topic-led interviews. These were analysed thematically with NVivo10\u00a9 by open coding, constant comparison, and the principles of grounded theory. The primary theme, \u2018when Ebola is real\u2019, centred on denial, knowledge, and acceptance. Ebola was denied until it was experienced or observed first-hand and thus health promotion was more effective if undertaken by those directly exposed to Ebola rather than by mass media communication. Factors that enabled acceptance and engagement with control measures included: access to good, proximate care and prevention activities; seeing that people can survive infection; and the co-option of trusted or influential local leadership, with bylaws implemented by community leaders being strongly respected. All participants noted that dignity, respect, and compassion were key components of effective control measures.",
    "Conclusions": "Successful control approaches need strong community leadership, with the aim of achieving collective understanding between communities and health workers. Health promotion for communities at risk is best conducted through people who have had close interaction with or who have survived Ebola as opposed to reliance on broad mass communication strategies."
