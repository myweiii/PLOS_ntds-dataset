Rates of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are high in disadvantaged populations globally. It results from acute rheumatic fever (ARF), a complication of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection. These are described as diseases of poverty, but exactly what components of poverty promote them has been unclear. The aim of this review was to find what specific social and environmental factors are associated with GAS infection, ARF and RHD, and if actions targeting these can reduce disease rates. We did a search of published literature and found 90 relevant articles. Many supported an association between GAS infection, ARF or RHD and crowding, dwelling characteristics, low education level and employment status, poor nutrition and low social class. There was enough evidence to show that crowding and socioeconomic disadvantage increase the risk of GAS infection and ARF/RHD. However, most studies were of fair to poor quality in their ability to answer the research question, and there was little interventional research. This may relate to challenges inherent in intervening to change social determinants of health, but may also suggest lesser research attention to health issues affecting disadvantaged populations. The association between crowding and disease risk strongly supports initiatives to reduce crowding. This should become a key target for ARF and RHD prevention.
