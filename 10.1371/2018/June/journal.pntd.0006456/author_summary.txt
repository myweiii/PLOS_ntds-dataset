Enzootic brucellosis is a bacterial infectious disease, which represents millions of dollars in production losses in livestock, as well as Disability- Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) associated with health and treatment in the human populations for Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). Despite these unequivocally known challenges, there has not been any reporting on this disease in livestock and humans in the recent past. The limitations the disease puts on livestock health and production, coupled with the zoonotic form, which is primarily driven by risky food consumption habits, and interaction with livestock in an enzootic setting with uncontrolled animal movement, means that this disease is not only of veterinary public health, but of trans-boundary importance as well.
