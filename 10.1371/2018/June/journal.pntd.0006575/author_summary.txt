Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are ubiquitous enzymes required for protein translation. They play a vital role in helping an organism's survival. Therefore, they have been suggested as favourable targets for the development of antileishmanial drugs. Leishmania, a protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis is known to encode 26 aaRSs. In the present study, we have worked on the functional characterization of L. donovani threonyl tRNA synthetase (LdThrRS) protein. We report that the L. donovani encodes a functional copy of ThrRS. The protein is localized in the cytosol and possibly also in mitochondria. The LdThrRS seems to be an essential gene for the parasite since null mutants did not survive. The deletion of one allele of the gene caused reduced growth and attenuated virulence in the heterozygous parasites. These parasites showed increased sensitivity to the known ThrRS inhibitor, borrelidin. Furthermore, borrelidin was found to inhibit the aminoacylation activity of LdThrRS thus, indicating that parasitic ThrRS can be exploited as a drug target for antileishmanial chemotherapy.
