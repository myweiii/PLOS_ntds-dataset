Leptospirosis is a globally important disease that is transmitted from animals to people and affects more than 1 million people worldwide each year. Leptospirosis is an important cause of febrile illness in northern Tanzania but little is known about the animal hosts of Leptospira infection for people in this area. This study aimed to evaluate the role of rodents and ruminant livestock (cattle, sheep and goats) in the epidemiology of Leptospira infection in northern Tanzania. The results of our study showed that ruminant livestock but not rodents are commonly infected with pathogenic Leptospira infection. Genetic typing identified four distinct types of Leptospira in livestock, including three types that were only identified in cattle, and one type that was identified in cattle, goats and sheep sampled in our study. These results indicate that livestock are a potential source of infection for people in Tanzania. This finding is important as a large proportion of the human population are employed in farming activities or keep ruminant livestock at home. Further work is needed to understand which Leptospira types are transmitted in our setting and to understand how livestock infection contributes to human disease.
