The surveys in 2014â€“16 received technical support from the Global Trachoma Mapping Project for data collection using the GTMP tools. The authors would like to thank Rebecca Willis at Tropical Data (www.tropicaldata.org). We also would like to thank all the surveyors for their collaboration in the field surveys and International Trachoma Initiative for providing tetracycline eye ointment.
