Buruli ulcer (BU), a necrotizing skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is currently reported in 33 countries, with the greatest disease burden mostly in West African countries along the gulf of Guinea. The lack of pain associated with BU disease enhances delay in seeking medical treatment that could result to complications. The current existing control strategy is early case detection. Previously BU diagnosis was based solely on clinical evidence by a healthcare worker, however, since other skin conditions present similar clinical signs as BU there is the need for further laboratory diagnosis. We microbiological confirmed all clinically diagnosed cases by IS2404 PCR, and Ziehl-Neelsen. We found that over 50% of the clinically diagnosed cases were not BU, thereby averting any unnecessary antimycobacterial treatment with the associated side effects.
