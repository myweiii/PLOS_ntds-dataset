Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a public health problem in Brazil. We used findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to explore the burden of NTDs in Brazil by sex, age group, specific causes, and Brazilian states from 1990 to 2016. In 2016, NTDs caused 475,410 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) (95% uncertainly interval [UI]: 337,334â€“679,482; equating to an age-standardized rate of 232.0 DALYs/100,000 population) in Brazil. Chagas disease was the main cause of DALYs among all NTDs. The disease burden was higher among males, in the youngest and eldest (children under 1 year and elderly aged 70 years and older), and in Brazilian states considered endemic for the major NTDs. There was a consistent reduction in overall age-standardized DALY rates for all NTDs combined (overall reduction of 45.7%) and most NTD causes between 1990 and 2016, but with a pronounced increase for dengue and visceral leishmaniasis. Despite of the remarkable progress in reducing the DALY rates, NTDs remain as important preventable and neglected causes of disability and premature death in Brazil. GBD 2016 results call for intensified and comprehensive efforts to prevent and reduce the burden of NTDs in Brazil, with special emphasis on less developed areas and vulnerable populations.
