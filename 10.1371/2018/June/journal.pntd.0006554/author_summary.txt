China has the largest number of HFRS infections in the world (9045 cases in 2016). Previous studies have found that HFRS infections are related to climate. However, the spatiotemporal distribution of the association between HFRS outbreaks at a large scale and global climate dynamics (i.e., over Eastern China during the period 2005â€“2016), as well as the identification of the geographic factors impacting this association have not been studied yet. This is then the dual focus of the present study. Strong synchronicities between global climate change and HFRS infections were detected across the entire study area that were linked to three main time periods (12, 18 and 36 mos). Specifically, strong and weak associations with non-point effects were detected in the south and middle-north parts of the study region, respectively. The climate impacts on HFRS were becoming increasingly sensitive with time. On the other hand, the geographic location (north coordinate, distance to coastline, east coordinate) makes a considerable contribution to the climate-HFRS association. As regards land-use, grassland and woodland were found to play important contributing roles to climate-HFRS association. Certain space-time links between global climate dynamics and HFRS infections were confirmed at a large spatial scale and within a long time period. The above findings could improve both the understanding of the HFRS transmission pattern and the forecasting of HFRS outbreaks.
