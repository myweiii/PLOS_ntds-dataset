Sandflies are important insect vectors that transmit many species of Leishmania, bacteria and viruses. We know very little about how this insect vector responds to viral infection. RNA interference (RNAi) utilizes small non-coding RNAs to regulate different aspects of animal physiology, including immune responses. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate a major antiviral response in insects. Virus-derived PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) can also be generated during infection, at least in some insects. Finally, endogenous microRNAs (miRNA) can regulate the host response to infection. Here we show that virus infection triggers activation of the siRNA pathway but not production of piRNAs in the sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis. Furthermore, activation or inhibition of the siRNA pathway had a direct effect on viral replication. We also show that virus infection caused mild changes to the expression of endogenous miRNAs. Our work describes for the first time a model to study virus infection in sandflies and highlights the importance of the siRNA pathway for the control of virus infection in L. longipalpis. The framework described here can be used to explore other aspects of the vector-pathogen interactions.
