Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging arboviral infection with a global distribution and can cause infections of the fetus and newborn after maternal CHIKV-infections during gestation. In this systematic review, we evaluated the risk for mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), antepartum fetal deaths (APFD) and symptomatic neonatal disease from maternal CHIKV-infections during gestation. Whenever meaningful, we also synthesized the data by random-effect-model (REM) meta-analysis. We also recorded the list of clinical manifestations of neonatal infections after maternal infections during gestation. Overall, published cohorts with pertinent data to estimate the impact to the fetuses and newborns of maternal CHIKV-infections were sparse compared to the number of recently reported CHIKV-infection outbreaks worldwide. Most cohorts reported data only on symptomatic neonatal infections rather than on all (symptomatic and asymptomatic) neonatal infections. By extrapolation also of these data, the pooled MTCT-risk was at least 15.5% (206/1331), (12.6% by REMs). Symptomatic disease occurred almost exclusively with maternal infections around the time of delivery. Overall, the pooled risk of symptomatic disease was 15.3% (203/1331), (11.9% by REMs); however, the risk of symptomatic disease from intrapartum maternal infections was 50.0% (23/46) vs 0% (0/712) from antepartum/peripartum maternal infections. The pooled APFDs-risk was low (1.7%); however, APFDs occurred with maternal infections in all trimesters. Infected newborns were either asymptomatic or presented during their first week of life, but not at the time of birth, with manifestations such as fever, irritability, rashes, hyperalgesia syndrome, diffuse limb edema, bullous dermatitis and occasionally also meningoencephalitis. Long-term neurodevelopmental delays occurred in 50% of symptomatic neonatal infections.
