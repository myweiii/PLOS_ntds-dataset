About 1.5 billion people are infected with soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Trichuris trichiura). Since morbidity correlates with the number of worms harbored by an infected individual, WHO aims to reduce moderate and heavy infections in pre- and school-aged children by 2020. The cornerstone of estimating the prevalence, assessing drug efficacy and monitoring drug resistance are accurate diagnostic tools. The currently recommended Kato-Katz, has some major disadvantages like a short processing window and low sensitivity and new diagnostic tools are needed. FECPAKG2 is an online, remote location tool developed for counting nematode eggs in sheep, cattle, equine and Camelids fecal samples. The output of the system is an image of the sample, which is saved and uploaded onto an internet cloud. This offers new options particularly for low resource settings. We tested FECPAKG2 for the first time for analyzing human stool in a randomized controlled trial. We observed a baseline sensitivity of 75.6% for detecting A. lumbricoides, 71.5% for hookworm and 65.8% for T. trichiura and an increased sensitivity for moderate infection intensities. Despite lower sensitivity and egg counts, FECPAKG2 was able to correctly estimate egg reduction rates. Following further development, FECPAKG2 might become an important tool for soil-transmitted helminth control programs, epidemiological and clinical studies.
