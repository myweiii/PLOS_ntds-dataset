In this study, a set of immunological biomarkers was studied in order to understand protection upon vaccination with yellow fever (17DD-YF) vaccine. For this purpose, the immunological memory statuses of circulating T- and B-cells along with the plasmatic molecules (cytokine profile) were monitored before and at distinct time-points after primary vaccination. A set of biomarkers were measured in the peripheral blood of primary 17-DD vaccinees after 30–45 days of vaccination, which were relatively sustained in vaccinees after 1–9 years of primary vaccination. Deficiencies and a total lack of memory-related immunological responses to yellow fever virus were observed after 10 to 11 years post-vaccination, regardless of the age at primary vaccination. Multi-parameter approaches defined two biomarkers (EMCD8 and IL-5CD4) as the top-two predictors of protection. The deficiency of attributes observed after 10–11 years post-vaccination reveals a time-dependent decrease of immunological memory responses related to the 17DD-YF vaccination. Therefore, these results highly suggest the need for close attention to vaccinees in YF endemic areas with more than 10 years of vaccination. At last, the biomarkers proposed in this study could be useful to monitor protection in YF-vaccinees living in or travelling to areas under risk of YF transmission.
