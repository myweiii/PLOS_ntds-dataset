Dengue is a neglected tropical disease which infects about 390 million people a year, particularly in areas of poverty. Currently, control of the primary dengue virus vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti, remains the only effective method of preventing the proliferation and spread of dengue virus. Contemporary control programs largely fail to consider the effects of environmental conditions on the ecology and life history traits, including innate immunity of mosquito populations. Here, we provide global, transcriptional analyses of how crowding-induced environmental stress results in reduced susceptibility of A. aegypti to dengue virus. This information has potential to inform the accurate conception and implementation of successful control programs. Additionally, the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for these differences in susceptibility may have application toward either transgenic mosquito population replacement or transmission blocking vaccination approaches to disease prevention.
