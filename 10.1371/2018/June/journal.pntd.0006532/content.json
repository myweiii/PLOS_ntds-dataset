    "Introduction": "The human pathogen, M. leprae, causes leprosy, a slowly developing chronic granulomatous disease mainly affecting the skin and peripheral nerves, resulting in disfiguring lesions and progressive nerve damage that can lead to muscle weakness or atrophy, bone loss, amputations and blindness [1]. The discovery of the bacillus was credited by work by the Norwegian physician Gerhardt Henrik Armauer Hansen in 1873. The name Hansen\u2019s disease (hansen\u00edase in Portuguese) is used in Brazil to lessen the stigma associated with the common name. Multidrug therapy (MDT) was introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the mid-1980\u2019s, and has been provided free of charge upon diagnosis worldwide for over 30 years. The worldwide prevalence of the disease has decreased from >5 million cases in the 1980\u2019s to <200,000 by 2016. Nevertheless, the WHO recorded 214,783 new cases in 2016 [2], slightly higher than the previous year, with around 80% of all cases being found in only three countries: India, Brazil and Indonesia. The Americas recorded 27,356 cases in 2016, with Brazil having 25,218, or 92.2% of the total. Brazil is still the only country in the world that has not reached the WHO goal of <1 new case per 10,000 population and is currently at around 1.2/10,000 nationally (SINAN, Brazil\u2019s Notifiable Diseases Information System) [3]. However, there is a wide variation in new case detection in regional areas in Brazil, ranging from as low as <0.2/10,000 in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul to >4/10,000, considered hyperendemic, in the central (Mato Grosso, Rond\u00f4nia), north (Par\u00e1, Tocantins), and northeastern states (Maranh\u00e3o) [4]. Historically, Par\u00e1 and the Amazon region have recorded some of the highest new case detection rates in the country, despite having one of the lowest population densities [5]. Reasons behind this have been well-documented, and include living in a hyperendemic area, low human development index (HDI, which combines life expectancy at birth, per capita income, and education level), living with an untreated index case or within 200 meters of a case, high household density (>2 people per bedroom), poor nutritional status, and lack of healthcare availability [6,7].\nThe disease causes a broad array of skin lesions, nerve damage, peripheral neuropathy and anesthesia. The variability in clinical manifestations of leprosy is aligned with the hosts\u2019 abilities to mount effective immune responses to M. leprae, dependent on the interplay of both cell mediated and humoral responses [8]. There is an overall genetic resistance towards developing leprosy, with over 90% of people having a natural immunity [9]. For those individuals who do progress to disease, the interplay of cell mediated and humoral immunity to M. leprae becomes clear from the well-known immunological and clinical leprosy spectrum, ranging from tuberculoid (TT/BT) or paucibacillary (PB) leprosy to lepromatous (BB/BL/LL) or multibacillary (MB) leprosy, defined by Ridley-Jopling classification based on histopathology and bacillary load [10]. PB patients generally show high cellular responses to M. leprae antigens in vitro as measured by the production of Th1 cytokines, particularly IFN-\u03b3, and have low antibody titers to M. leprae-specific antigens. MB patients have lost some or all capacity to mount a cell mediated response due to T cell anergy but have high antibody titers to M. leprae antigens, particularly to the M. leprae-specific glycolipid, PGL-I [11,12]. The humoral response to PGL-I in leprosy patients, mainly IgM, correlates very well with the BI (bacillary index) and is highly specific, and the anti-PGL-I titer can be easily assessed using either the standard ELISA assay or in a lateral flow device [13\u201316] using the synthetic di- or trisaccharide of PGL-I linked to a protein carrier, bovine or human serum albumin (BSA or HSA) derivatives. Anti-PGL-I IgM seropositivity has been used to reliably assess the prevalence of leprosy in endemic areas, since a positive titer is a definitive biomarker of prior M. leprae infection [17\u201321].\nSince M. leprae cannot be grown in vitro on axenic medium, the mechanism of human transmission has long been debated. The most widely accepted theory is that untreated index cases, particularly MB individuals who are capable of discharging an estimated 107 bacilli per day from nasal secretions [22], are the main source of transmission via the aerosol route. A number of studies have shown that consanguineous individuals of index cases living for extended periods, months or years, in the same household (household contacts, HC) have the highest risk for developing disease [23\u201326].\nBesides human contact, the only other known transmission route is from human contact with armadillos that have been naturally infected with M. leprae. Armadillos have an immune system that responds similarly to M. leprae infection, and essentially recapitulates the spectrum of human disease [27]. This includes developing progressive nerve damage and characteristic ulcers and skin lesions due to loss of sensation in the feet and face and even develop high antibody titers to PGL-I and other M. leprae proteins [28]. As early as 1975, wild armadillos were found to be naturally infected with M. leprae, but it was later shown that sylvan leprosy had existed in this species for decades before they were artificially infected [29,30]. Surveys in Texas and Louisiana showed that disease prevalence rates among nine-banded armadillos were >20% in some areas [31].\nIn this study we investigated armadillos from an area in Brazil that is hyperendemic for leprosy in the town of Belterra in western Par\u00e1 state to explore whether sylvan leprosy exists in wild armadillos in this area. We also performed a survey of the relationship of the people in this town with armadillos to determine if any activities related to hunting, killing, preparing or handling the armadillo meat for consumption, as well as the frequency of armadillo in the diet had any effect on the anti-PGL-I titer.",
    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nThe research protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at the Universidade Federal do Oeste do Par\u00e1 (UFOPA) and the Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1 (UFPA) (IRB protocol #517.394 ICS/UFPA) and Colorado State University (IRB protocol 15-6340H) and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All individuals who agreed to participate read and signed a written informed consent document. Environmental approval of wild armadillo tissue sampling was obtained with ICMBio authorization for research activities (SISBIO 44831\u20131). Environmental approval of wild armadillo tissue sampling was obtained with ICMBio authorization for research activities (SISBIO 44831\u20131), Minist\u00e9rio do Meio Ambiente, Instituto Chico Mendes de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da Biodiversidade\u2014ICMBio, Sistema de Autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o e Informa\u00e7\u00e3o em Biodiversidade\u2014SISBIO, Brazil.\n\n\nStudy location\nThe survey site chosen was the city of Belterra in western Par\u00e1 state where two rural communities exist at 92 Km (S\u00e3o Jorge) and 135 Km (Corpus Christi) on the Santar\u00e9m-Cuiab\u00e1 highway, located roughly by coordinates at 2\u00b0 38'S and 54\u00b0 56'W. The city has a total area of 4,398 km2 with 17,036 inhabitants (IBGE, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica, 2015) and is roughly 1,300 Km southwest from the capital city of Bel\u00e9m. The city was chosen because of its proximity to Santar\u00e9m where one of the affiliated universities is located (UFOPA) and because it was determined that there was a high density of armadillos living in the surrounding forest with a high percentage of people living in this rural area that hunted or consumed armadillos as food.\n\n\nHuman subject population\nA total of 146 individuals living in the town of Belterra were asked to participate in a research protocol approved by the institutional review boards at the Universidade Federal do Oeste do Par\u00e1 (UFOPA) and the Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1 (UFPA) (IRB protocol #517.394 ICS/UFPA) and Colorado State University (IRB protocol 15-6340H) and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All individuals who agreed to participate read and signed a written informed consent document. In the case of minors, consent was obtained from a parent or guardian of the child. All individuals received a free dermatologic exam performed by experienced leprosy clinicians, and a sample of blood was drawn from each person by a trained phlebotomist for anti-PGL-I titer assessment. Besides demographic information for each individual, a survey included questions about the extent of contact with armadillos (hunting armadillos in the forests; killing and/or handling the armadillo meat for consumption; and the frequency of eating armadillo meat). The diagnosis of leprosy was performed using internationally accepted clinical criteria based on the presence of skin lesions with sensory loss and/or nerve damage associated with nerve swelling and pain, muscle weakness or disability. Individuals diagnosed with leprosy received free MDT treatment from their local basic health unit.\n\n\nAssessment of anti-PGL-I titer by ELISA\nAn indirect ELISA was used to measure the anti-PGL-I IgM titer of all of the serum samples tested at a 1:300 dilution using a protocol previously reported [32]. The cut-off for positivity was established at an optical density (O.D.) of 0.295 based on the average plus three times the standard deviation of healthy subjects from a hyperendemic area as reported. The O.D. for each well was read at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader.\n\n\nCollection of armadillo liver and spleen samples for detection of RLEP sequence by PCR\nBy collaborating with local residents who hunted armadillos in the surrounding forest in the area, we obtained samples of armadillo liver and spleen from freshly killed animals from different households from residents in both villages in Belterra (\u201cA\u201d armadillos from Corpus Christi, n = 3, and \u201cB\u201d armadillos from S\u00e3o Jorge, n = 13). A sterile scalpel blade was used to excise several pieces of tissue, at least 1cm3 each, and placed in individual sterile 5 ml plastic tubes containing 70% ethanol to fix the specimen before DNA extraction. A fresh scalpel blade was used for each tissue for each animal. Environmental approval of wild armadillo tissue sampling was obtained with ICMBio authorization for research activities (SISBIO 44831\u20131). DNA was extracted in the laboratory from approximately 1 gm of fixed tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The amount of DNA in each sample was quantified using nanodrop. The M. leprae-specific repetitive sequence, RLEP, was amplified by PCR using a Qiagen Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen) and primers (LP1 forward primer:\n5'-TGCATGTCATGGCCTTGAGG-3' and LP2 reverse primer:\n5'-CACCGATACCAGCGGCAGAA-3') that amplifies a 129-base pair fragment found in the M. leprae genome. The primer sequences and the protocol used were adapted from Donoghue [33] using the following PCR protocol: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, primer annealing at 58\u00b0C for 40 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Each reaction set included a positive control tube using purified M. leprae DNA (2 ng) and a negative control tube without template DNA.\n\n\nStaining of M. leprae in armadillo spleen sections to detect mycobacterial DNA, cell wall constituents and M. leprae PGL-I\nAt the time of necropsies, samples of spleen were aseptically removed and prepared for histological examination and specific staining procedures for visualization of mycobacteria. Tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), embedded in paraffin and sectioned to 5 \u03bcm thickness. Subsequent tissue sections were mounted on glass slides, deparaffinized and stained either with auramine-rhodamine (AR) or SYBR Gold fluorescent stain [34]. For AR staining, each section was stained using the TB Fluorescent Stain Kit T (Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland) per manufacturer's instructions. The AR stain was added to the deparaffinized section on the slide and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 25 min, washed in acid-alcohol (0.5% HCl in 70% isopropanol) for no more than 3 min, followed by washing with water and counterstaining with potassium permanganate (0.5%) for 4 min. The slides were washed again in water and then mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade mounting medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California).\nSYBR Gold staining was performed using a dilution of SYBR Gold fluorescence dye at 1:1,000 in a stain solution of 0.85\u2005M phenol in a 60% glycerol/14% isopropanol solution in distilled water. The slides were heated on a block at 65\u00b0C for 5\u2005min and then cooled at room temperature for an additional 5\u2005min. The tissue sections were washed with acid alcohol (0.5% HCl in 70% isopropanol) for 3 min, then washed with water and counterstained with hematoxylin QS (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), for 5\u201310\u2005s. The excess hematoxylin was washed away with distilled H2O and slides were subsequently stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) at 200\u2005ng/ml final concentration for 10\u2005min and washed again with water. Slides were mounted with Prolong Gold antifade mounting media. All stained sections were visualized using Zeiss 510 confocal microscopy and Zen software.\nFor PGL-I antigen localization, deparaffinized spleen sections were covered with peroxidazed 1 solution (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) for 5 min to block endogenous peroxidase, followed by antigen retrieval procedure (Dako, Agilent Technologies, Carpinteria, CA). Background sniper (Biocare Medical) was used for 10 min to block nonspecific binding sites, followed by addition of a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for PGL-I (produced at Colorado State University) and incubated for 2 h in a humidified chamber at room temperature. Thereafter, the sections were washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS and incubated with a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG-F(ab\u02b9)2 coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h. After washing the sections with PBS, the substrate (ImmPACT from AEC, Vector Laboratories) was added for 10 min or until brownish-red color was developed. Slides were washed with PBS and counterstained with hematoxylin, followed by visualization using light microscopy.\nControl M. leprae infected and non-infected armadillo spleens that were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded were generously provided by Dr. Maria Pena from the National Hansen\u2019s Disease Program (NHDP), Baton Rouge, LA. Sections of control tissues were stained for PGL-I antigen as above. Sections were also stained by the Fite Faraco modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to identify acid fast bacilli in control and wild armadillo tissues.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe anti-PGL-I titer expressed as the O.D. was compared with the epidemiologic data and individual\u2019s contact with armadillos by the Mann-Whitney test. The frequency of anti-PGL-I positives in the total population and among diagnosed leprosy patients were estimated between variables by the ratio of crossed products-Odds Ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals using the \u03c72 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test to verify the significance of associations. The GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) statistical software program was used. The threshold for statistical significance was set at 5%.",
    "Results": "High infection rates in armadillos from Belterra\nSixteen armadillos with an average weight of 3.7 Kg and 54.3 cm in length were captured by local residents by hunting in the surrounding tropical forest located around the communities. When extracted DNA from spleen tissues was tested for the presence of the RLEP repetitive sequence by PCR, 10/16 armadillos were positive (62%), indicating that a high percentage of these animals were infected with M. leprae (Fig 1A). Since M. leprae infects internal organs in armadillos, particularly spleen and liver, we examined both tissues to determine if infection was consistently found in these organs. Of five armadillos examined from the same group, armadillos that were RLEP positive in the spleen were also RLEP positive in the liver while animals that were RLEP negative were negative in both (Fig 1B). In addition, the signal strength in positive animals was much stronger in spleen than in liver. This finding is consistent with yields of M. leprae from experimentally infected armadillos from NHDP, with the yields in the spleen averaging 4 to 10 fold higher than in liver. The sequence of the RLEP product produced by PCR was confirmed to be identical to the published sequence found in M. leprae for all positive samples by submitting the PCR product for sequencing. Whole genome sequence results confirmed M. leprae sequence in three animals (A7, B21 and B22) with ~2X coverage.\nA) Analysis of PCR RLEP product from spleen samples from nine different armadillos. B) Analysis of RLEP from paired samples of liver (L) and spleen (S) from five different armadillos. The signal from positive samples is consistently stronger in the spleen for each individual. The positive control (+ve) reaction included purified M. leprae DNA, 2 ng, while the negative control (-ve) lacked DNA template.\nThin sections of paraffin embedded armadillo spleens were stained to identify M. leprae in situ using SYBR Gold (Fig 2A and 2B) and auramine/rhodamine (Fig 2C), staining techniques which are highly specific for DNA or mycobacterial cell wall components, respectively. A rabbit polyclonal serum raised against the M. leprae-specific PGL-I antigen was used to stain spleen sections by immunohistochemistry. Wild or control infected armadillo sections stained with the pre-immune serum and control uninfected armadillo spleens from NHDP stained with the anti-PGL-I serum were negative (Fig 3A and 3B, respectively). Diffusely localized PGL-I antigen was seen in spleen sections from control infected NHDP armadillos (Fig 3C and 3D) and wild infected armadillos (Fig 3E and 3F). In all cases, positive staining was identified using these techniques only in infected armadillo tissues. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Fite Faraco staining (acid fast staining) of control NHDP infected and noninfected armadillo and infected wild armadillo tissues sections were included to show the architecture of the spleen and acid fast bacilli (Fig 4A\u20134F).\nA) SYBR Gold staining (blue) of M. leprae in armadillo spleen A7, arrow denotes stained bacillus. Insert, enlarged area showing stained bacillus. B) SYBR Gold staining (green) of M. leprae in armadillo spleen B7. Arrow denotes stained cluster of bacilli, enlarged in insert. C) Auramine/rhodamine stained cluster (red) of bacilli (arrow) located within an apoptotic cell next to a cell-free necrotic zone (*) in armadillo spleen A7.\nA) Wild infected armadillo B7 section stained with pre-immune rabbit serum, negative control; B) NHDP uninfected armadillo 13\u201302 stained with rabbit anti-PGL-I, negative control; C) NHDP infected armadillo 11K902 stained with anti-PGL-I showing diffuse brown staining, positive control; D) Higher magnification of NHDP infected armadillo 11K902 stained with anti-PGL-I, positive control; E) Wild infected armadillo A7 stained with anti-PGL-I, showing diffuse brown staining. F) Higher magnification of wild infected armadillo A7 stained with anti-PGL-I, showing diffuse brown staining with more intense clusters.\nA) Non-infected control NHDP armadillo spleen (13\u201302) stained by H&E to show normal splenic architecture; B) M. leprae infected NHDP armadillo spleen (11I302) stained by H&E; C) Non-infected control NHDP armadillo spleen (12\u201370) stained by Fite Faraco method showing only counterstain; D) Many acid fast bacilli (red clusters) in M. leprae infected NHDP armadillo spleen (11I302) revealed by Fite Faraco stain; E) Wild armadillo (A2) spleen section stained with Fite Faraco, arrow pointing to acid fast bacilli at lower magnification and enlarged in insert; F) Wild armadillo (A2) spleen section stained with Fite Faraco revealing clusters of acid fast bacilli (arrows).\n\n\nCharacteristics of the individuals studied\nOf the 146 people surveyed in the town of Belterra, the subjects were divided equally (n = 73) between two villages located within the town 44 Km apart, namely the village of S\u00e3o Jorge, where residents of 32 households participated, and the village of Corpus Christi, where 31 households were surveyed (Fig 5). Four new cases were diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms during our visit (2.7%), and we identified 3 patients who had been previously diagnosed and received treatment, bringing the total to 7 patients identified. Testing for anti-PGL-I titer by ELISA showed that 92/146 (63%) were positive. These numbers are consistent with previously published data from our group on new case detection and anti-PGL-I positivity rates for individuals living in hyperendemic areas in the state of Par\u00e1.\nMunicipality of Belterra in western Par\u00e1, and the villages of S\u00e3o Jorge at Km 92 and Corpus Christi at Km 135 on the Santar\u00e9m-Cuiab\u00e1 highway.\nThe four newly diagnosed cases and three other individuals who had completed treatment displayed a wide range of characteristics (Table 1). The age range was from 13 to 72, with two residing in the S\u00e3o Jorge community, while five lived in Corpus Christi. Four of these individuals hunted armadillos resulting in a relatively high risk (OR 6.73, 95% CI 1.41\u201332.09, p = 0.02). Although hunting armadillos in the forest was exclusively a male activity and handling or cleaning the armadillo meat to prepare it for cooking was primarily a responsibility for women, 6 of these male patients indicated that they also participated in cleaning or preparing armadillo meat for cooking and also ate armadillo regularly, although these factors were not significant, probably due to the small sample size. This suggests that the majority of the leprosy patients had patterns of exposure (hunting, handling, and eating) to armadillos that were all at the high end relative to other groups in the village.\n\n\nInfluence of hunting, cleaning or preparing meat for consumption, or frequency of eating armadillo meat on the anti-PGL-I titer\nWe collected information from all of the individuals surveyed (n = 146) regarding the level of exposure they had with armadillos based on different behavioral aspects and dietary preferences. This included detailed questions about various activities, including whether or not individuals hunted armadillos in the surrounding forest; whether they were involved in killing the animals and preparing the meat for cooking or consumption; and the frequency with which they consumed armadillo meat, ranging from not at all to those who ate armadillo meat more than once per month. Of all of the individuals surveyed, 27/146 (18.5%) hunted armadillos in the forest, 96/146 (65.8%) either handled or prepared the meat for consumption, and 91/146 (62.3%) ate armadillo meat at least once during the past year, with 27/146 (18.5%) individuals eating them more than once per month. The percentage of individuals that participated in at least one of these activities (hunting, preparing the meat for consumption, or eating the meat) was 96/146 (65.8%). We then examined the PGL-I titers for each group of individuals based on whether or not they participated in these activities or preferences (Table 2).\nOverall, there was no statistical difference in the anti-PGL-I titers of those individuals who hunted or did not hunt armadillos (p = 0.99); those who did or did not handle armadillo meat in preparation for consumption (p = 0.90); or between individuals who did not eat or ate armadillos (p = 0.50) (Fig 6A\u20136C). However, when we subdivided individuals who ate armadillo meat in low to moderate frequencies (less than once per month) versus those who ate it frequently (more than once per month), there was a significantly higher median anti-PGL-I titer in those individuals who consumed armadillo meat most frequently (p = 0.01) with a higher risk (OR = 1.77, 95% CI [0.64\u20134.89]) (Fig 6D) compared to other groups.\nBehaviors were associated with the type of contact with armadillos, including A) hunting armadillos in the forest, B) handling or preparing armadillo meat for cooking or consumption, C) eating armadillo meat and D) frequency of consuming armadillos in the diet.",
    "Discussion": "The mammalian order Xenarthra includes sloths, anteaters and armadillos. Armadillos are observed only in the Americas, having ten known genera composed of 21 different species in the wild, and are known reservoirs for a number of bacterial and parasitic pathogens, including Mycobacteria, Trypanosoma, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Leptospirosis, Sporothrix, Chagas and Paracoccidioides [35,36]. D. novemcinctus, commonly known as the nine-banded armadillo in the U.S. or chicken-armadillo in Brazil, is the only species whose range includes North, Central and South America [37], and are ground burrowers and opportunistic feeders (almost 500 separate food items, mostly insects, make up their diet). Nine-banded armadillos extended their range from Mexico into Texas some time during the 1800s, and then eventually increased their range north and east into the gulf states of the southern U.S. [38]. In the early 1970s, it was determined that armadillos were capable of sustaining the growth of M. leprae to extremely high bacillary loads (up to 1011 bacilli per gram of tissue), with around 80% of the animals showing some level of susceptibility to experimental infection [39]. Shortly after this, in 1975 it was discovered that wild armadillos living in Texas and Louisiana were naturally infected with M. leprae, and serological studies of archived armadillo serum samples for anti-PGL-I antibodies indicated that they had likely shown this biomarker of infection as early as the 1960s. Other investigators, using different approaches to identify acid-fast bacilli by histopathology, M. leprae DNA (such as RLEP sequence) by PCR or serological studies to show anti-PGL-I antibody positivity revealed evidence of infection in armadillo species in a number of countries in Central and South America, including Mexico [40], Colombia [41], and Argentina [42]. In Brazil, several groups have reported the possibility of M. leprae infection in armadillos in different regions, including in the southeastern state of Esp\u00edrito Santo [43] and more recently in the northeast in Cear\u00e1 state [44,45]. Another case control study indicated that human contact with armadillos increased the risk of leprosy in Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil [46]. There was one previous study that examined whether the consumption of armadillo meat had an effect on the incidence of leprosy, but no association was found [47]. However, this study examined individuals living in the southern state of Paran\u00e1, considered a medium endemic area (<1 new case per 10,000 population), which is around fifty times lower than in the state of Par\u00e1, and there was no evidence presented that armadillos in this area were infected with M. leprae. In a recent study of 98 marmosets captured from different regions of Brazil to look for Ag85B and RLEP DNA by PCR, none were found to be positive by this method [48], although 14 were found to be positive for rpoB, another mycobacterial genetic marker. Nevertheless, the likelihood that environmental reservoirs, including armadillos, amoeba [49,50] and most recently, red squirrels in Scotland and the U.K. [51,52], could play a role in M. leprae persistence and transmission to humans has been increasingly cited as a real possibility [53], which would necessitate a different approach to leprosy control and prevention.\nAlthough the link between zoonotic M. leprae infection in armadillos and transmission of these particular unique strain types to humans has been firmly established in the southern U.S., the actual mechanism of transmission of M. leprae between armadillos and humans would be difficult to determine because of the lack of being able to grow this species in vitro in axenic medium. Possible routes of infection that have been proposed include inhalation of particles of soil contaminated by infected armadillos during the process of gardening activity [54] or from contact with contaminated soil or water samples in leprosy endemic areas [55\u201357]. The evidence for transmission of M. leprae to humans from these environmental sources is somewhat circumstantial, and has relied mainly on the identification of certain genetic markers, including SNP type and variable nucleotide tandem repeats (VNTR) found in M. leprae DNA isolated from these sources and matching these with strain types existing in the human population living in the same area. A more definitive transmission link between distinct SNP subtypes circulating in armadillos and those found in human leprosy patients in the southern and southeastern U.S. has been more rigorously confirmed by whole genome sequencing of M. leprae from tissue or biopsy specimens [58,59], which is currently being pursued with samples from Par\u00e1, Brazil. Notably, in this study we used four different techniques to demonstrate the presence of M. leprae in the armadillo tissue samples. First, PCR was used show RLEP positivity in 62% of the tissues sampled, with confirmation of a match of the RLEP sequence to that already published; second, auramine/rhodamine and SYBR Gold staining showed positively stained bacilli within histological sections, techniques specifically used to identify mycobacteria in situ; third, the M. leprae-specific antigen, PGL-I, was localized in situ with a polyclonal rabbit antibody; and finally by showing acid fast staining of bacilli in wild armadillo spleen sections by the Fite Faraco technique.\nThe total number of new cases of leprosy in the U.S. has remained relatively constant at ~200 per year, while the new case detection rate in 2016 in Brazil of around 25,000 cases in 207 million people translates to 1.2 per 10,000 population. Since armadillos occur at very high numbers in many rural areas in Brazil and the new case detection rate in humans has been considered hyperendemic in the Amazon region for a long time, it is extremely likely that the introduction of M. leprae in armadillos due to interactions with infected humans is not a recent event, particularly as the percentage of infection in these animals exceeds that found in the southern U.S.\nDue to the already high percentage of anti-PGL-I positivity in the general population, we initially wondered whether exposure to armadillos would have a measurable effect on increasing the rates of positivity of this biomarker of infection. However, recording the habits of some of the families, we discovered certain practices that could dramatically influence exposure to M. leprae from armadillos. Hunters in the villages who capture wild armadillos in the surrounding forest sometimes bring the animals to their home alive where they are kept in an enclosure inside the house for up to six months while being well-fed to increase their body weight and sometimes even bathed like a pet. If an animal was infected and shedding bacilli, this would greatly facilitate infection of individuals living in this dwelling via the aerosol route [60]. Another risk of exposure to viable M. leprae would likely occur by killing the animal and handling the meat for consumption, as blood or other tissue fluids could gain entry through any cuts in the skin. Cooking the meat would effectively kill M. leprae bacilli and render infection by eating cooked meat a very low probability. However, another practice in certain areas was for individuals to prepare a kind of raw liver and onion ceviche. Consumption of raw meat, particularly the liver of armadillos, which is one of the main organs where M. leprae growth is highest, would be considered a very high risk behavior and among the practices most likely leading to successful infection. Although we did not see a significant increase in the anti-PGL-I titer comparing groups of individuals who did or did not eat armadillos, the finding that individuals who consumed armadillo meat frequently (more than once per month and even up to twice per week) had a significantly higher titer indicates that this behavior has an effect on the frequency of infection. Although capturing of wild armadillos for consumption is prohibited in Brazil, it is obvious that a good percentage of people in poor rural areas enjoy and utilize this source of dietary protein, and this preference would be hard to change even by educating them about this potential source of M. leprae infection. In addition, the WHO has only considered strategies for intervention and treatment of cases involving human-to-human transmission. Interruption of infection by zoonotic transmission (armadillo-to-human) has not been addressed, and would be a difficult challenge for the WHO [61]. Nevertheless, determining the extent of infection in these wild animals and applying whole genome sequencing to identify strain types circulating in armadillos and human populations interacting with them is important to clarify the relative risk that nonhuman reservoirs have in the transmission of this (and perhaps other) tropical diseases and may help to improve strategies to combat leprosy."
