Armadillos have been shown to be a natural reservoir of Mycobacterium leprae infection in the southern states of the U.S. and have been implicated in the zoonotic transmission of leprosy to humans. To investigate this in Brazil, we conducted surveys of armadillos in western Par√° state in the Brazilian Amazon region where leprosy is hyperendemic in humans. Individuals living in the small town of Belterra were surveyed for the extent and frequency of interaction with armadillos (hunting, preparing the meat for cooking, or eating the meat for food). We also took samples of liver and spleen from armadillos to look for M. leprae infection in the tissues. We found that a majority of residents had some contact with armadillos (~65%) and that infection by M. leprae in armadillos in this area was also very high (62%). Those individuals who ate armadillo meat more than once a month had a significantly higher antibody titer to the M. leprae-specific antigen, PGL-I. Understanding the dynamics of leprosy transmission in different geographic regions and knowing the behavioral risks of humans interacting with potentially infected animals will help clarify the relative risk of zoonotic transmission of leprosy in this region.
