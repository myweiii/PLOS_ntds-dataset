Neglected Tropical Diseases are a group of several communicable diseases prevalent in the tropical and subtropical areas. The co-endemicity of these diseases, the similarity of the clinical signs, need to maximize limited financial and human resources have necessitated the integrated approach. Our study aims to share the lessons learned from the integrated approach in the fight against Buruli ulcer, leprosy and yaws in a rural district in Benin. In this study, health workers, community health volunteers involved in this study were trained on integrated approach of the Buruli ulcer, leprosy and yaws. The trained team visited the villages and schools in the district of Lalo in Benin. After the education and awareness raising session, all persons with a skin disease who presented voluntarily to the team were carefully examined in a well-lit area which respected their privacy. Of 1106 people with skin diseases, 15 (1.4%) were Buruli ulcer and three (0.3%) were leprosy. The majority of cases were other skin conditions. Sustaining this skin Neglected Tropical Diseases integrated control will require the training of peripheral health workers not only on skin Neglected Tropical Diseases but also on basic dermatology to deal with other common skin diseases.
