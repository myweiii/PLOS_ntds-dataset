Biological invasions (the introduction and adaptation of living organisms to a new environment) are increasingly frequent due to worldwide intensification of human-associated exchanges. They can lead to the introduction of pathogens in new areas and favour the emergence of diseases. Rodents are prominent invasive species, and act as reservoirs in many infectious diseases. The aim of our study was to determine the link between the distribution and spread of two parasites, Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma lewisi, and the progressive invasion of Senegal by two commensal rodent species, the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus, and the black rat Rattus rattus. We identified R. rattus as a potential reservoir for Leishmania major and T. lewisi in the southern part of Senegal. The presence of these two pathogens in R. rattus may be of different origins. The invader R. rattus could have been locally contaminated with L. major. Conversely, T. lewisi infection could have been introduced in Senegal by R. rattus, and seems to be poorly transmitted to native rodents. Altogether, these data show that R. rattus is a carrier of both parasites, and could be responsible for the emergence of new foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis or for the transmission of atypical human trypanosomiasis in Senegal.
