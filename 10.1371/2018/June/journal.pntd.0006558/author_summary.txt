Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram negative bacteria, is the causative agent for melioidosis. Annually, around 165,000 people suffer from melioidosis worldwide. B. pseudomallei is present in wet soil and stagnant water. It enters the human body via percutaneous inoculation, inhalation, aspiration, and occasionally ingestion. Clinical presentations of B. pseudomallei vary by geographical region. Melioidosis occurs predominantly in Southeast Asia, northern Australia, South Asia (including India), and China. Occasional cases occur in other countries around the world. Melioidosis has become a public health problem in India, due to the increasing numbers of people affected in various parts of the country. This study provides baseline data on the genetic diversity among B. pseudomallei isolates from different clinical samples (blood, pus, tissue and urine) of patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital using signature nucleotide sequences via multi locus sequence typing (MLST). Further, this study shows a relationship among B. pseudomallei previously reported in various Southeast Asian countries over the years from 1935 and 1947 with those seen in current clinical cases.
