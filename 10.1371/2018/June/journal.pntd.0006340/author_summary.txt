Rabies is a deadly, but vaccine-preventable disease which still causes tens of thousands of deaths yearly, mostly in Asia and Africa. Rabies virus is spread via the saliva of infected mammals to humans, usually through bites or contamination of open wounds. Access to measures like wound cleansing with soap and rabies vaccination immediately after contact with a suspected rabid animal (exposure) can be life-saving. The post-exposure vaccination schedule currently recommended by the World Health Organization for intradermal injection is the Thai Red Cross regimen, requiring 4 clinic visits in one month, with 2 injections given at each visit on days (D) 0 (day of the contact), 3, 7, and 28. In this study, we evaluated the antibody responses and the safety profile of a new shortened schedule, requiring 3 clinic visits and only 1 week to complete, consisting of 4 intradermal injections given at each visit on D0, 3, and 7 (the 4-site/1-week regimen). The study was conducted in the Philippines and Thailand which enrolled 885 healthy volunteers, at least 1 year of age, with no real exposure to rabies. The two schedules induced adequate antibody responses in similar proportion of volunteers at day 49. The vaccine administration according to both schedules was well tolerated.
