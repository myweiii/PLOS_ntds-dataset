Scientific production on Chagas cardiomyopathy has grown considerably since the turn of the 21st century, probably reflecting the increased incidence of Chagas disease in non-endemic areas like the USA and Europe. Brazil and the USA dominate the research, but we found a very small proportion of clinical trials on Chagas cardiomyopathy and a low scientific production in several endemic countries with a high prevalence of the disease such as Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Bolivia. We observed a polarity between endemic and non-endemic countries where clinical research and basic research predominate, respectively. Different approaches could help to redress the observed imbalance of research on Chagas cardiomyopathy: encouraging researchers to conduct more clinical trials, launching international collaborations to help endemic countries contribute more, and strengthening links between basic and clinical research. It is crucial to foster translational research in order to link basic knowledge on the physiology of the disease with clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment.
