A major outbreak of chikungunya virus occurred for the first time in Dhaka, Bangladesh between May and September 2017. In this study, a face-to-face interview with a structured questionnaire was conducted to collect data to investigate the clinical symptoms, quality of life, and economic aspects of 1,326 chikungunya patients during the first two weeks of infection. The severity of the disease was similar to previously reported severe outbreaks elsewhere but joint pain prior to fever emerged as a unique symptom in the Dhaka outbreak. This unique clinical feature was consistent across age and sex of the patients. Some clinical symptoms varied with age. For instance, a higher proportion of skin rash were found among children (under 15) while morning stiffness, severity, and duration of pain were proportionally higher among other age groups. Joint swelling was most commonly noted in elderly patients (60+ years). About 83% of the patients reported low to very low overall quality of life (QoL) during first two weeks of chikungunya infection. Elderly patients reported lower average QoL scores compared to <60 years. Interestingly, housewives reported higher QoL score compared to those of businessmen and service holders. In particular, patients in the highest monthly income category bracket (BDT 50,000 per month; >$606 per month) reported the lowest average overall score. Nearly 95% of the patients have mostly confined to sickbed and approximately 30% of them lost more than 10 days of productivity due to severe arthropathy. Our study would contribute to establishing an effective syndromic surveillance system for early detection and timely public health intervention of future chikungunya outbreaks in resource-limited countries like Bangladesh.
