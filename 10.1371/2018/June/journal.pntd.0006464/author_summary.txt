Many international health interventions in resource-limited settings involve treatments that are fully funded by donor organizations and, therefore, available for free to those in need. Trachoma, a bacterial eye disease that can cause blindness if left untreated, has frequently been the target of surgical outreach programs. However, even when the surgery is offered for free, a substantial number of eligible patients refuse surgery. This study explored why eligible patients did not present for surgery. When findings indicated that many patients did not understand the intervention and feared that it would be a major procedure or involve a long recovery time, we created a frequently asked questions document to address these misconceptions directly. This document was used at the surgical recruitment stage to better educate patients and community health workers, and it likely helped increase turnout for surgery. This study has implications beyond just eye surgery, and suggests steps that other global health interventions may want to consider to identify and address barriers uptake.
