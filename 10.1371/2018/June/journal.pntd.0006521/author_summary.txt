Chikungunya is considered a serious mosquito-borne disease in many tropical and subtropical countries throughout the world. It is already an epidemic disease in Brazil and poses as a potential risk in Florida. It is mainly transmitted by mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. These mosquito species are common and abundant throughout much of the year in Brazil and Florida. In this study, we determined two components of vector competence from Brazilian and Florida populations of both mosquitoes to the emergent Asian genotype of chikungunya virus: viral dissemination and transmission rates. Both Aedes populations exhibited a high proportion of disseminated infection as early as two days after ingestion of chikungunya virus infected blood. Transmission efficiency was higher in Ae. aegypti from Florida and Ae. albopictus from Brazil. Our findings suggest that mosquito-virus interactions of both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus may vary by geographic population, which may impact public health measures and should be considered during outbreaks of this arboviral disease.
