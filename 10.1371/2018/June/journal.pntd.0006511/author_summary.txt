Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, has been recognized as one of the most devastating pathogen experienced by mankind. It remains endemic in many parts of the world, and is considered emerging pathogen. A live attenuated Y. pestis strain EV line NIIEG has been used for decades in the former Soviet Union for human vaccination and has proven effective against all forms of plague. We began characterizing the Y. pestis-specific antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses in people immunized with live plague vaccine. The long term goal of our research is to understand the protective mechanisms underlying immunity to plague in humans and to discover novel protective antigens for their incorporation into a subunit vaccine. Here, we describe our study on immune responses in vaccinees to one of the essential virulence factors of Y. pestis, namely Pla antigen. The results of the study shed light on the development of the optimal markers to assess the correlation with vaccine-induced protection.
