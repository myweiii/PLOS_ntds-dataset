Intrusive triatomine bugs such as Triatoma dimidiata in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico, are responsible for the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi to humans, which can lead to Chagas disease. The control of these bugs is a challenge as insecticide spraying is poorly effective, and alternative strategies need to be developed for a sustainable control. We tested a novel Ecohealth approach, based on window insect screens manufacture and installation through community participation to reduce the presence of bugs inside houses. The proportion of triatomines found inside houses was significantly reduced in houses with insect screens, which effectively kept more bugs on the outside of houses. We estimated that the intervention would lead to a 32% reduction in new cases of infection each year and in the prevalence of T. cruzi infection. The low cost of the intervention and the durability of screens further indicate that the proposed Ecohealth approach is effective for the long-term and sustainable control of intrusive T. dimidiata vectors in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. This strategy may also be easily adapted to other bug species and regions with similar characteristics and sould be expanded in additional villages in the region.
