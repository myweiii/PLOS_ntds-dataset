Skin sores, also known as impetigo, are highly contagious bacterial skin infections, which are found commonly in school children and occasionally in adults. Skin sores are prevalent in disadvantaged or resource-poor settings. In Australia, about two thirds of Aboriginal children suffer from skin sores by their first birthday. If untreated or treated poorly, skin sores can eventually cause heart and kidney problems. It is also believed that scabies, another common skin infection in Aboriginal children, can increase the risk of developing skin sores by allowing the bacteria to enter the skin more easily through breaks in the skin. Our research explored the following: if scabies is a risk factor for skin sores then what is the strength of the association between the two conditions.
