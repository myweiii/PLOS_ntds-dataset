The Lutzomyia longipalpis complex has a wide but discontinuous distribution in Latin America, extending throughout the Neotropical realm between Mexico and northern Argentina and Uruguay. In the Americas, this sandfly is the main vector of Leishmania infantum, the parasite responsible for Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). The Lu. longipalpis complex is composed of at least four sibling species, although there is no current consensus on the number of haplogroups, or their divergence. In Argentina, little is known about the complex population structure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the diversity and genetic structure of Lu. longipalpis from Argentina and subsequently to analyze the complex phylogeography at a Latin American scale, using two mitochondrial markers. Greatest genetic diversity was found in Tartagal, Santo Tomé and San Ignacio. Two genetic clusters and three Lu. longipalpis haplogroups were identified from the six sites in Argentina. Phylogeographic analyzes using ND4 and cyt b gene sequences and those from across the Neotropical realm registered in GenBank, suggest greater divergence than previously reported. At least eight haplogroups are differentiated using the ND4, each separated by multiple mutational steps. Lu. longipalpis complex divergence from its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was estimated at mid Pleistocene, 0.70 MYA (95% HPD interval = 0.48–0.99 MYA).
