Several studies had shown that people infected with schistosome parasites were at risk of getting HIV and that they may have higher HIV viral concentrations in their blood as well. The authors explored the impact of the parasite on HIV disease after infection, expecting that people co-infected with the parasite at time of HIV-infection would develop worse HIV outcomes than people who did not have the parasite. HIV seroconverters were identified among a large cohort tested regularly for HIV in northwest Tanzania and were followed-up in clinics to determine their CD4 + T-cells counts and mortality. The seroconverters’ stored blood samples were tested for infection with the parasite and outcomes were compared between seroconverters who were and were not infected with the parasites at the time that they became HIV-infected. The authors surprisingly found that people with the parasite experienced fewer negative outcomes of HIV than people who did not have the parasite. To the investigators’ knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to find this result. Long-term immunological changes may explain this protective effect and more studies are recommended to explore this research question.
