Many cases of leprosy still occur in low and middle-income countries, with a considerable proportion of them leading to permanent nerve damage and visible physical deformities. Disease elimination can be achieved with a better understanding of the sociodemographic characteristics of those most affected by the disease and by targeting those with greater risk within endemic countries. To address this question, we reviewed all published studies evaluating the social determinants of leprosy in countries endemic for leprosy. We found 39 studies, most of them conducted in Brazil (i.e., an upper-middle-income country), India or Bangladesh (i.e., lower-middle income countries), and none in low-income countries. Our review found strong evidence that males, household contacts of leprosy patients, individuals living in crowded households, and individuals who suffered food shortage in the past are more affected by leprosy. Evidence also exists that increasing age, poor sanitary and socioeconomic conditions, lower levels of education, and food insecurity are associated with a greater risk of leprosy. Our review underscores the importance of improving living conditions and decreasing inequality in low and middle-income countries to achieve leprosy elimination.
