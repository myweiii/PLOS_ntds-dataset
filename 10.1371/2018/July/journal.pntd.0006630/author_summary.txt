Plague and cutaneous leishmaniasis are two diseases transmissible to humans vectored by fleas and sand flies, respectively. Although the diseases are vectored by two different insect types, the primary reservoir host for both diseases in desert foci in Central Asia is the great gerbil. Therefore, a promising strategy for controlling both vectors, and subsequently both diseases, is to target the host. A field study was conducted in southeastern Kazakhstan to evaluate the use of a rodent bait containing an insecticide (0.005% fipronil), applied to active gerbil burrows, in reducing field-caught flea and sand fly abundance. Results suggested that the fleas infesting gerbils could be reduced to zero for at least 80-days after completing treatment. The number of reproductive female sand flies were also reduced to zero 3-weeks after completing treatment, but environmental factors also influenced abundance. Additionally, because the bait contained a low insecticide concentration, the application rate remained low, posing reduced risk to non-target animal species. Our approach incorporates detailed evaluation of the use of a systemic insecticide in controlling fleas infesting gerbils and sand flies caught in light traps. Hence, this study provides an explicit means of evaluating the use of a new vector control approach in reducing two distinct insect vectors parasitizing the same host.
