Chagasâ€™ disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and is a major health problem in Latin America. There is an urgent need for new treatments as the few currently used drugs have many serious drawbacks. New potential drugs inhibiting parasite ergosterol biosynthesis have recently failed in the clinic in spite of showing promising results in lab-based cellular models of the disease. To understand why these may have failed we have devised new cellular assays that predict poor performance of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors. The new assays comprise of a T. cruzi strain panel drug efficacy assay that encompasses the six key genetic lineages and a compound washout assay that assesses the ability of candidate drugs to kill all parasites. The ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor posaconazole performed poorly against the slow replicating/ cycling PAH179 strain and in the washout assay. We conclude that a minimum number of replications are likely to be required for posaconazole to cause a cytocidal effect and not all parasites are susceptible to inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis. Our new assays will allow early identification of such compounds so that only the most promising drug candidates are progressed towards the clinic.
