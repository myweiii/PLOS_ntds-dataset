Patients affected by the clinical conditions of lymphatic filariasis (lymphoedema and hydrocoele) and podoconiosis (lymphoedema) require access to a minimum package of care to prevent progression of the disease, and to improve their quality of life. Clear estimates of the number and location of these patients is essential for the delivery of this care. To address this, a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Ethiopia using the Health Extension Worker (HEW) network to identify all cases of lymphoedema and hydrocoele in 20 co-endemic woredas (districts). A total of 26,123 cases of clinical morbidity were identified. Of these, 24,908 (95.3%) had leg lymphoedema, of which 89.3% were bilateral. The results of this study will help assist the Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) programme at the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) in Ethiopia to effectively and equitably plan the delivery of a basic package of care to those suffering from the clinical manifestations of both diseases.
