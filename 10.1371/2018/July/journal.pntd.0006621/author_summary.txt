Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, distributed worldwide, affecting millions of people each year, and leading to sixty thousand deaths per year. These bacteria are found in soil and water and are eliminated by the urine of rodents, their natural reservoir. Through skin contact, bacteria can be acquired, infecting the host. Infection process in leptospirosis is not completely understood and here we add another layer of disease regulation. Recent studies have shown that pathogens can modulate host response. Our current study examined the expression of microRNAs in murine macrophages following an 8h infection with virulent, attenuated and saprophyte strains of Leptospira. This study provides the first evidence that these post-transcriptional regulatory molecules, microRNAs, are modulated in macrophages in a species and virulence-specific manner, following infection with different strains of Leptospira spp. These microRNAs are involved in the regulation of inflammatory and antimicrobial responses in the host and could lead to the identification of biomarkers or therapeutic targets for this disease.
