Chandipura virus is a negatively stranded single RNA virus, which has claimed many lives in several outbreaks in India and Indian subcontinent. Our previous study shows CNS inflammation plays a vital role in inducing neurodegeneration post infection. In continuation to that our present study systematically examined the mechanism of microglial activation and function of NF-kappaB in CNS inflammation. We have shown that though CHPV infection is not productive in microglia, it leads to NF-kappaB activation that regulates secretion of cytokines and chemokines. The uncontrolled expression of inflammatory molecule disturbs the brain homeostasis leading to alteration of tight junction proteins that are an essential component in Blood-Brain Barrier. The expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 initiates peripheral leukocytes recruitment at the site of infection leading to aggravated inflammatory response, which has the deleterious effect on neurons. Our result shows nitrosporeusine targets microglial activation, and inhibits inflammation in in vitro as well as in vivo. The inhibition of inflammation has a protective effect on brain leading to enhance survival in mouse model.
