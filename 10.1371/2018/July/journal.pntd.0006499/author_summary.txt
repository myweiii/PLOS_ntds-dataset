In this study, the 16S rDNA-targeted metagenomic sequencing was used to determine the bacterial community and diversity in the spleens of small wild mammals from China. The 16S rDNAs were amplified from the spleen genomic DNAs of 35 small wild mice and shrews and sequenced by Illumina MiSeq technology. More than 1,300,000 sequences were obtained after quality control and classified into a total of 1,967 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) clustered at 97% similarity. The two most abundant bacterial phyla were Firmicutes and Proteobacteria according to the analysis of rarefied sequences. Within the bacterial communities detected in this study, vector-borne bacteria, Anaplasma, Rickettsia and Coxiella, were adjacently clustered by hierarchical analysis. Significant differences in many bacterial features between Anaplasma-positive and Anaplasma-negative samples were observed, suggesting that the infection of small wild mammals with Anaplasma is associated with a distinct pattern of spleen microbiota. This study has revealed the complex bacterial profiles in the spleens of wild mice and shrews. The detection of vector-borne bacteria highlights the role of wild mice and shrews as animal reservoirs with potential public health importance in the studied areas.
