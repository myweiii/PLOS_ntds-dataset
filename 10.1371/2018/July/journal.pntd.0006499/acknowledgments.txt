The authors would like to thank in particular the VCD technicians who were involved in the collection of the samples, making the Kato-Katz slides and reading of samples in the field. We are also grateful for the contribution of District NTD focal Persons for their efforts in mobilizing the schools and communities for the study. Approval for the surveys was gratefully received from Vector Control Research and Ethics Committee (VCDREC) and Uganda National Council of Science & Technology (UNCST).
