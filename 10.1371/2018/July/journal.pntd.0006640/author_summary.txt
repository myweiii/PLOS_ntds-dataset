Cryptosporidium is an important cause of childhood diarrhea. Research on cryptosporidiosis in countries where it is endemic remains limited; few studies have comprehensively examined risk factors for children in Kenya and similar settings. We examined characteristics associated with Cryptosporidium in children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea in rural western Kenya. We found there is little to clinically distinguish cryptosporidiosis from other childhood diarrhea in the absence of point of care diagnostics. Infants had the highest odds of Cryptosporidium infection; it has been previously established that Cryptosporidium infections in infancy can have severe consequences. Prolonged/persistent duration diarrhea and growth shortfalls were significantly more pronounced among cases with Cryptosporidium. Undernutrition and stunting in children in low- and middle-income countries have predicted decreased cognitive and school performance, thus long-term consequences could be appreciable. Using rainwater as the primary drinking water source and boiling drinking water were protective against Cryptosporidium infection, thus certain water sources may contribute to transmission. Like other studies in Kenya, we predominantly identified Cryptosporidium hominis, an anthropogenic species. Advances in point of care detection, prevention and control approaches, effective water treatment technologies, and clinical management options are needed to mitigate the potentially severe and long-term consequences of Cryptosporidium infection in children.
