Infection by Trypanosoma cruzi parasitic protozoan remains endemic in Latin America. After acute parasitemia phase is controlled by host immune system, infected individuals remain clinically silent but manifest a number of micro and macro cardiac injuries for several years. Eventually many of the infected individuals develop chronic cardiomyopathy that leads to heart failure and sudden death. Cardiac muscle cells are rich in mitochondria and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the chief superoxide scavenging enzyme in the mitochondria. In this study, we show that a deficiency of MnSOD exacerbates the T. cruzi induced mitochondrial dysfunction of the electron transport chain and energy production in the heart. Further, MnSOD deficiency resulted in increased mitochondrial release of oxidants and caused excessive oxidative damage in the chagasic heart. Our results suggest that small molecule agonists of MnSOD will have potential utility as adjuvant therapy in preventing the development of chronic Chagas disease in infected individuals.
