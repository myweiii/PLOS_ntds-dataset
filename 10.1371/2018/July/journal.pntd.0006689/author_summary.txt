Buruli ulcer, a neglected tropical disease, has been described as an emerging public health problem in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. One of the challenges highlighted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is improving access to biomedical healthcare. A research priority is thus to determine local understandings of skin disorders such as Buruli ulcer, and social-cultural factors that influence health-seeking. This article explores perspectives on Buruli among fisherfolk in northwestern Uganda along the River Nile, where the ulcer has previously been documented. The findings are based on a long-term ethnographic study of health, healing and illness in this region, and integrate insights from biomedical and social sciences. This biosocial approach demonstrates that, rather than seeking therapy late, people in this region sought treatment from local herbalists promptly when signs of skin lesions appeared. This was not because of non-biomedical understandings of disease. The reasons why people continue to trust local herbalists as experts in Buruli can be found in the historical context of how ulcers have been understood and managed, and the broader context of quests for therapy in this region. While the findings relate to where this study took place, the lessons learnt and biosocial approach used could be usefully applied in other settings where Buruli ulcer is endemic, and for understanding the local context of other neglected diseases and global health priorities.
