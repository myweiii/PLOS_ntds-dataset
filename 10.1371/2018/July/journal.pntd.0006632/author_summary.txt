Scrub typhus is a leading cause of undifferentiated febrile illness, putting 1 billion people at risk of infection. Trombiculid mites are the major vectors of the causative agent of scrub typhus, Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT), which is transferred through the bite of an infected mite. Previously, we reported the co-existence of multiple OT strains within laboratory-reared mites. Here, we extended our investigation into wild trombiculid mite populations collected from areas of Thailand where scrub typhus is endemic. More advanced next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to examine the presence and abundance of mixed infection in individual mites based on sequence analysis of the 56-kDa type-specific antigen gene. NGS data revealed heterogeneity of OT genotypes in field-collected mites, and mixed infection with two to three OT genotypes was consistently observed (prevalence rate = 17.9%). Moreover, the identical OT genotype detected among co-feeding mites with single or mixed infections suggesting that co-feeding transmission may occur during the feeding process. This result could explain the occurrence of mixed infections in individual mites, as well as the recovery of multiple infected mites from the same host.
