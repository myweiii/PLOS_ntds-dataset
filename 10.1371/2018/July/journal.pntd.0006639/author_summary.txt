The protozoan parasite Leishmania causes a spectrum of diseases collectively known as leishmaniasis. The parasite is transmitted to humans by the bite of its vector, the sand fly, following which the parasite invades host white blood cells, particularly macrophages. Leishmaniasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease, and is endemic in 97 countries. Symptoms of the disease depend on the species of Leishmania. These include skin lesions, destruction of the mucosal membranes, and the visceral form which is usually fatal if untreated. Current therapeutic options for leishmaniasis have a number of associated problems that include toxicity, the development of drug resistance and poor patient compliance due to lengthy and painful treatment regimens. New therapeutics are therefore urgently needed. The ability to screen potential drug candidates requires robust screening assays. Currently, screening the intracellular parasite relies on microscopy-based techniques that require expensive equipment, are time consuming and only detect parasite burden, not viability. By using a transgenic cell line that expresses the NanoLuc-PEST luciferase, we show that we have a parasite-specific viability marker that can be used to measure the efficacy of compounds against the intracellular parasite. We validate the potential of this cell line by screening the MMV Pathogen Box.
