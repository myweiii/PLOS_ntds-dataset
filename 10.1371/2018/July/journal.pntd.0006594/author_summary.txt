The control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the first human case confirmed in this municipality. Another pool was infected with Zika virus, demonstrating the first evidence that vertical transmission occurs in naturally infected Aedes aegypti mosquito populations.
