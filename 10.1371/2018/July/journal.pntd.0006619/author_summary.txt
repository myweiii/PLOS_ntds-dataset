Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) affect the health and economies of populations globally. Many of these diseases are zoonotic, occurring as a consequence of the interaction between humans and animals, particularly at the household level in low- and middle-income countries. Based on the WHO Global Strategy to accelerate and sustain progress on NTDs, including zoonoses, through improvement in sanitation, hygiene and water, this review identifies existing published studies examining the interaction between water, sanitation and hygiene elements, animals and zoonosis transmission within the household. Only two out of 7588 studies screened met the criteria. They showed the relevance of animal influence in the effectiveness of WASH measures, as well as the difficulties of designing studies that look at this particular interaction. A synthesis of several studies analysed in the second selection stage of the review shows a significant relationship between animal and WASH factors for disease transmission. It also shows certain contradictions regarding the importance of key risk factors for some diseases across studies. It is therefore crucial to carry out further studies showing the interaction between animals and water, hygiene and sanitation measures within the household to improve these control measures and reduce zoonotic neglected tropical disease transmission.
