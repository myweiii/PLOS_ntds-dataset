Many efficacious tools exist to control NTDs, but effectively moving these tools and approaches from the boardroom to the village is a complicated socio-political process. In the era of Sustainable Development Goals, global health has become more focused on improving the delivery of existing interventions. Greater attention to implementation research, including the value of social science perspectives, has followed in an effort to build a science of global health delivery. This paper presents an accessible and actionable socio-anthropological framework for understanding the effectiveness factors of NTD interventions. The framework was developed by comparatively analyzing three large-scale NTD interventions in Eastern Africa: rabies elimination in Tanzania, sleeping sickness control in Uganda and the prevention of parasitic worms in Zambia. The framework includes five “intervention domains” where the effectiveness of these interventions was determined: 1) the terrain of intervention; 2) community agency; 3) the strategies and incentives of field staff; 4) the socio-materiality of technology; and 5) the governance of interventions. The paper illustrates the importance of each of these domains, presenting lessons learnt and practical recommendations. As a flexible analytical tool, the framework could be integrated into the planning and implementation process itself, bringing the insights of socio-anthropological approaches into an emerging science of NTD delivery.
