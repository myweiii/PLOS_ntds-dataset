I have accumulated many intellectual debts during this research, working with many collaborators and field assistants on NTDs since 2010. There are simply too many people to name. Collectively, without your assistance, this work would not have been possible. Thanks for the companionship, insights and hard work! In particular, the fieldwork that informed this particular paper was conducted during a doctorate thesis at the Centre of African Studies and Division of Infection and Pathway Medicine, University of Edinburgh. I would like to thank my supervisory committee including Sue Welburn, James Smith, Lawrence Dritsas, Ian Scoones and Rebecca Marsland, among many other people, for intellectual guidance during this time. Partners in Africa from the Integrated Control of Neglected Zoonoses (ICONZ) project (Charles Waiswa, Rudovick Kazwala, Helena Ngowi, Chummy Sikasunge and many others) provided substantial assistance in Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia, for which I remain very grateful.
