Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) bind to the poly(A) tails of eukaryotic mRNAs and function in regulating mRNA fate. Many eukaryotes have several PABP paralogs and the current view is that each PABP binds a specific subset of mRNAs. Trypanosoma brucei has two PABPs, and to understand the differential functionality of these paralogs we identified interacting proteins for each. We found unique interactors for both PABPs, and significant differences between the two interaction cohorts. Our data indicate that the two PABP paralogs of trypanosomes have very distinct roles in mediating mRNA fate.
