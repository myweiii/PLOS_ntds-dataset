Trachoma is the common ophthalmic infection and cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by ocular infections with causative agent of Chlamydia trachomatis that might effect in chronic inflammation of the eyelids, which produces scarring of the conjunctiva that can consequently cause entropion trichiasis, resulting in interned eyelashes. The interned eyelashes as well as other changes of the eye, harm the cornea causing severe pain, corneal opacity and resulting vision loss. Over a million people in Ethiopia are estimated to have Trachomatous trichiasis (TT). Trachomatous trichiasis surgery is the backbone treatment option. Though the provision of free surgical services in the country exists, utilization rates are very low. Identifying the determinants for not utilizing the service is mandatory to take measures towards surgical uptake. A total of 482 study participants (241 cases and 241 controls) with age of ≥15 years were included in the study. The determinants for not use of surgical services were respondents in the younger age group (16–30 years) and widowed participants, lengthy distance from the service, unavailability of TT surgeon, no trichiasis symptoms, long time knowing the problem, right/left eye affected, no experience of epilation practice, and participants who knew place of service was given at health center.
