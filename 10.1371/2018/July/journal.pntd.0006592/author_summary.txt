The authors discuss a nonlinear method, based on Mutual Information, for selection of the presence of Aedes aegypti pupae in different breeding sites. The authors compare this method with the logistic regression model. In this study, using the Neural Network model, the variables that better discriminate the containers with Aedes aegypti pupae from the containers without pupae were size—the larger the container volume the greater the proportion of containers positive for pupae–, the presence of another type of pupa other than Aedes aegypti and the location of the container outside the home. The Neural Network method, a model with the capacity to emulate non-linear data, got better results in comparison with the discriminant power of the Logistic Regression model. Thus, the outcomes of the Neural Networks method achieved better separability in classifying the containers with pupae and those with no pupae. This type of analysis will aid in the efforts to design an efficient program to control Aedes aegypti that can concentrate principally on containers which present the greatest productivity.
