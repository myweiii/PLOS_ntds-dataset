    "Background": "The immune system depends on effector pathways to eliminate invading pathogens from the host in vivo. Macrophages (M\u03a6) of the innate immune system are armed with vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial responses to kill intracellular microbes. However, how the physiological levels of vitamin D during M\u03a6 differentiation affect phenotype and function is unknown.",
    "Methodology/principal": "The human innate immune system consists of divergent M\u03a6 subsets that serve distinct functions in vivo. Both IL-15 and IL-10 induce M\u03a6 differentiation, but IL-15 induces primary human monocytes to differentiate into antimicrobial M\u03a6 (IL-15 M\u03a6) that robustly express the vitamin D pathway. However, how vitamin D status alters IL-15 M\u03a6 phenotype and function is unknown. In this study, we found that adding 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D3) during the IL-15 induced differentiation of monocytes into M\u03a6 increased the expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, including both CAMP mRNA and the encoded protein cathelicidin in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of physiological levels of 25D during differentiation of IL-15 M\u03a6 led to a significant vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial response against intracellular Mycobacterium leprae but did not change the phenotype or phagocytic function of these M\u03a6. These data suggest that activation of the vitamin D pathway during IL-15 M\u03a6 differentiation augments the antimicrobial response against M. leprae infection.",
    "Conclusions/significance": "Our data demonstrates that the presence of vitamin D during M\u03a6 differentiation bestows the capacity to mount an antimicrobial response against M. leprae."
