Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is caused by infection with filarial worms that are transmitted by mosquito bites. Globally, 68 million are infected, with ~36 million people disfigured and disabled by complications such as severe swelling of the legs (elephantiasis) or scrotum (hydrocele). The Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF) aims to interrupt disease transmission through mass drug administration (MDA), and to control illness and suffering in affected persons by 2020. The World Health Organization recommends conducting Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) in school children aged 6–7 years, to determine if infection rates have dropped to levels where disease transmission is no longer sustainable. American Samoa made significant progress towards eliminating LF. Following seven rounds of MDA, American Samoa passed TAS in 2011–2012 and 2015, with antigen prevalence of <1%. Despite passing TAS, recent studies have provided evidence of ongoing disease transmission in American Samoa, questioning the suitability of TAS for conducting surveillance after MDA has stopped. We compared a school-based survey of children aged 6–7 years and a community-based survey targeting people aged ≥8 years as tools for conducting post-MDA surveillance of LF. Our study provides recommendations for strengthening of post-MDA surveillance as countries approach the GPELF elimination targets.
