Chromoblastomycosis is a disfiguring disease usually occurring in rural workers from poor and remote communities. In Brazil, the most frequent agents of this neglected disease are the species belonging to the genus Fonsecaea. The disease occurs after traumatic inoculation during work. As the lesions progress, itching becomes severe, and scratching may result in further inoculation to other body sites. When patients seek medical help, the lesions are usually extensive and disfiguring. For this reason, a more effective and less time-consuming treatment is important. Oral antifungal therapy is not very effective, must be taken for months or years, it is costly for most patients and often unavailable. Hence, it is important to determine the in vitro antifungal susceptibility and correlate it with the isolated species. In this study, Fonsecaea monophora was the predominant species and, differently from some studies, dissemination to the central nervous system was not observed. In vitro analysis showed that the most effective antifungal drugs were terbinafine and voriconazole, followed by itraconazole, the most used drug in the treatment of this disease. The combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine may be synergistic, depending on the infective strain.
