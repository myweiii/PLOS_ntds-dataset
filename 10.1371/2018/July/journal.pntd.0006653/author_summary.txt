Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites and transmitted by sand flies. It is a complex disease and is underresearched disease, that depending on the parasite species, can take multiple forms, which can be less or more aggressive. It manifests as ulcers, nodules or other lesions mostly on the face and extremities. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is found across South and Central America, Africa, Europe, the Middle-East and Asia, and generally it is classified into forms of the Old World and New World. Colombia now ranks second after Brazil, with around 15,000 reported cases per year. Most cases are caused by L. panamensis, L. braziliensis, and L. guyanensis. Since the 1940â€™s, Pentavalent antimonials (Sb5) parenteral treatment have been the first-line of drugs for treating cutaneous leishmaniasis, however, the cost, the variable efficacy and the toxicity associated with its use, make it necessary to search for new treatments. Although there are other approved treatments for the disease, They also show issues of adverse reactions, and are used is mainly as a second option of treatment depending on the availability of these in health programs. Topical therapy of cutaneous leishmaniasis is a promising approach. Anfoleish is a cream than developed in Colombia. In this paper, we report the results of phase Ib/II, randomized trial in Colombia to assess the safety and therapeutic response of topical Anfoleish for the treatment of Cutaneous leishmaniasis.
