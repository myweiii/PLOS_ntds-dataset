    "Background": "Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) is a neglected parasitic skin disease, widespread in resource-poor communities in tropical and subtropical countries. Incidence and risk factors have never been investigated in a cohort study.",
    "Methodology/Principal findings": "To understand the seasonal epidemiology of HrCLM, an open cohort of 476 children in a resource-poor community in Manaus, Brazil was examined for HrCLM monthly over a period of 6 months. Monthly prevalence and intensity of infection were correlated with the amount of monthly precipitation. Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated male sex (hazard ratio [HR] 3.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.95\u20135.56), walking barefoot on sandy ground (HR 2.30; 95% CI 1.03\u20135.16), poverty (HR 2.13; 95% CI 1.09\u20134.17) and age between 10 and 14 years (HR 1.87; 95% CI 1.01\u20133.46) as predictors of HrCLM. Monthly incidence rates ranged between 0.21 and 1.05 cases per person-year with an overall incidence of 0.52 per person-year.",
    "Conclusions/Significance": "HrCLM is a frequent parasitic skin disease in this resource-poor community. Every second child theoretically becomes infected during one year. Boys, 10 to 14 years old, belonging to the poorest households of the community, are the most vulnerable population group. Even in the tropical monsoonal climate of Amazonia there is a considerable seasonal variation with monthly incidence and number of lesions peaking in the rainy season."
