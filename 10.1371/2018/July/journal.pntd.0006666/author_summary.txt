Mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria are less capable of transmitting dengue virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus. We use a mathematical model to quantify the impact of infecting wild Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes with wAlbB and wMel strains of Wolbachia in reducing the transmission of these viruses. The model is a system of ordinary differential equations that accounts for reduced fitness of the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, reduced transmissibility of an infection, and the behavior changes of infected individuals caused by the infection. We derived an explicit formula for the effective reproduction number for when the host population are partially immune to new infections, as occurs in seasonal outbreaks. We compared the effectiveness of different species of mosquitoes, different strains of Wolbachia, and different diseases. Our model is a general model that can produce outputs for a specific location, once the data for the location are available to parameterize the model. The spatial heterogeneity of the populations must be considered before using this model to help guide policy decisions.
