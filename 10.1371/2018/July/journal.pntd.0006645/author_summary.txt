Leprosy is a Neglected Tropical Disease that is still common in many countries. Patients who have had leprosy often suffer long-term physical disabilities. For some patients, disabilities occur after finishing treatment or existing disabilities may get worse. We contacted 222 leprosy patients who had previously completed multidrug therapy (MDT) in a typical endemic area in Brazil and assessed leprosy-associated disabilities, and the associated clinical or sociodemographic factors. We found that 17.1% of the participants had severe (grade 2) disabilities. Disabilities were more common among patients who had had a leprosy reaction, thickening and/or tenderness of one or more nerve trunks and were unemployed. The findings are important because we show that physical disabilities occur frequently after treatment completion in this area, and that patients need long-term follow-up by the health system. Integrated measures that consider clinical and socio-economic aspects are also needed to reduce leprosy burden after completion of treatment, such as devising of public policies, implementation of clinical monitoring and the development of evidence-based guidelines for follow-up after release from MDT.
