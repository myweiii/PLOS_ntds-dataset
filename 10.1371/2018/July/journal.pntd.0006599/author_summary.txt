Aedes aegypti is an efficient vector for arboviruses which is partially determined by its vector competence (VC) status, a highly variable trait. Based on previous reports, the VC of New World mosquitoes is limited for ZIKV. However, a VC assessment from additional geographical sources was lacking. Therefore, we evaluated the VC for ZIKV using recently colonized mosquitoes from Mexico. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus were highly susceptible to ZIKV infection but varied greatly in their transmission rates. As with previous studies of other flaviviruses; VC for ZIKV was highly variable in both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus but was greatest in Ae. aegypti, supporting its role as the main ZIKV vector.
