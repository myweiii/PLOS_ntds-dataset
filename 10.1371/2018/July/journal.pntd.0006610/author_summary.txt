Leprosy could present with chronic neuropathic pain, which might severely disturb daily life and mental health of leprosy-infected patients. This complication could also occur even years after antibiotics therapy completion, and we noticed that it is associated with recent leprosy reactions and nerve tenderness on physical examination. This is the first study that describes the epidemiology of neuropathic pain in leprosy patients in Nepal. More than one-third of leprosy patients who had completed multidrug therapy, are still suffering from neuropathic pain, and this study demonstrated that it has caused a great impact to their daily activities and psychological status. Therefore, prompt recognition and management of neuropathic pain are mandatory while taking care of the patients with leprosy.
